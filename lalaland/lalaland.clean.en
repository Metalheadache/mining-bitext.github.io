it &apos;s another hot and sunny Southern California day .
the temperature in downtown Los Angeles is 29 Â° C ...
and at night will drop to ...
I think about that day
I left him at the Greyhound station
West of Santa Fe
we were 17 but he was sweet and it was true
still I did what I had to do
Cause I just knew
Summer : Sunday nights
we &apos;d sink into our seats right as they dimmed out all the lights
a Technicolor world made out of music and machine
it called me to be on that screen
and live inside each scene
&quot; without a nickel to my name Hopped a bus , here I came &quot;
could be brave or just insane
we &apos;ll have to see
Cause maybe in that sleepy town
&quot; he &apos;ll sit one day , the lights are down &quot;
he &apos;ll see my face and think of he used to know me
&quot; Climb these hills , I &apos;m reaching for the heights &quot;
and chasing all the lights that shine
and when they let you down
you &apos;ll get up off the ground
Cause morning rolls around And it &apos;s another day of sun
I hear &apos;em ev &apos;ry day
the rhythms in the canyons that &apos;ll never fade away
the ballads in barrooms left by those who came before
&quot; they say : &quot; &quot; you gotta want it more &quot; &quot; &quot;
so I bang on ev &apos;ry door
&quot; and even when the answer &apos;s &quot; &quot; no &quot; &quot; or when my money &apos;s running low &quot;
the dusty mic and neon glow
are all I need
and someday as I sing my song
a small-town kid &apos;ll come along
that &apos;ll be the thing to push him on and go go
&quot; Climb these hills , I &apos;m reaching for the heights &quot;
and chasing all the lights that shine
and when they let you down
you &apos;ll get up off the ground
Cause morning rolls around and it &apos;s another day of sun
and when they let you down
the morning rolls around
it &apos;s another day of sun
it &apos;s another day of sun
&quot; it &apos;s another day of sun Sun , sun , sun , sun &quot;
it &apos;s another day of sun
just one more day of sun
it &apos;s another day of sun
another day has just begun
it &apos;s another day of sun
it &apos;s another day of sun

like it &apos;s a dirty word ?
Unpaid bills are not romantic . call her .
I &apos;m not going to call her .
the thing is ... You &apos;re acting like life &apos;s ...

I want to be on the ropes .
Okay ? I &apos;m just - I &apos;m letting life
hit me until it gets tired .
&quot; and then I &apos;m gonna hit back . it &apos;s a classic &quot; &quot; rope-a-dope &quot; &quot; . &quot;

- Yeah . - Okay .
- It &apos;s really nice to meet you .

Thank you . any other requests ?
the girl in the front !
- &apos; I Ran &apos; . - &apos; I Ran &apos; . a fantastic suggestion !
&quot; all right , piano man , tickle those ivories . let &apos;s hit it . &quot;
one two three four !
that &apos;s right !
I walk alone the avenue
I never thought I &apos;d meet a girl like you
- Meet a girl like you ... - Me ?
with auburn hair and tawny eyes
the kind of eyes that hypnotize me through
that hypnotize me through
&quot; and I ran , I ran so far away &quot;
I couldn &apos;t get away
all right . I remember you .
and I would admit I was a little curt that night .
curt ?
&quot; - Okay , I was an asshole . I can admit that . - Okay . &quot;
but requesting &apos; I Ran &apos; from a serious musician is just- it &apos;s too far .
&quot; my Lord ! did you just say &quot; &quot; a serious musician &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
I don &apos;t think so .
- Can I borrow what you &apos;re wearing ? - Why ?
because I have an audition next week .
I &apos;m playing a serious firefighter .
so you &apos;re an actress . I thought you look familiar . have I seen you on anything ?
a coffee shop on the Warner Bros. lot . that &apos;s classic .
&quot; - Oh , I see . - Yeah . &quot;
you &apos;re a barista . and I can see how you could then look down on me from all the way up there .
next set .
he doesn &apos;t ... I don &apos;t ...
he doesn &apos;t tell me what to do .
- He just told you what to ... - I know . I let him .
- What is your name ? Mia . - Mia .
I guess I &apos;ll see you in the movies .
- You know Joseph Campbell ? - Yes .
&quot; I have this idea that you were reimagining &quot; &quot; Goldilocks and the Three Bears &quot; &quot; ... &quot;
from the perspective of the bears .
- You know it &apos;s thrilling . - It could be a franchise .
right .
so well we don &apos;t know if they were cooped up up there . we don &apos;t know .
George Michael !
Hello .
sorry . it &apos;s - I know that guy .
did you get your keys ?
- Yes . - Can you grab mine ?
- Sorry what ? - Will you be able to grab my- my keys ?
I can &apos;t hear you .
&quot; - Sorry , can you grab my keys ? - Oh . &quot;
&quot; - Please . - Oh , there we go . &quot;
- Thank you . - You &apos;re welcome .
- What kind ? - It &apos;s a Prius .
- That does &apos;t help me . - With a green ribbon .
all right .
&quot; those look , uh , comfortable . &quot;
they are .
Thank you for saving the day back there .
&quot; well , you didn &apos;t really give me much of a choice . &quot;
it &apos;s pretty strange that we keep running into each other .
it is strange .
maybe it means something .
- I doubt it . - Yeah . I don &apos;t think so .
where &apos;s my car ? !
put that thing to your chin .
- This ? - Yeah .
it makes your head into an antenna .
I think it gives you cancer but you find your car faster .
what ?
I mean you don &apos;t get to live as long but you get where you &apos;re going quicker so it all evens out .
- That sounds terrible . - Just a suggestion .
you &apos;re a real ...
- What &apos;s the word am I looking for ? - Knight in shining armor .
- Weirdo . that was the word . - Okay .
&quot; not much to look at , huh ? &quot;
I &apos;ve seen better .
the sun is nearly gone
the lights are turning on
a silver shine that stretches to the sea
we stumbled on a view That &apos;s tailor made for two
what a shame those two are you and me
some other girl and guy
would love this swirling sky
but there &apos;s only you and I
and we &apos;ve got no shot
this could never be
- You &apos;re not the type for me - Really ?
and there &apos;s not a spark in sight
what a waste of a lovely night
you say there &apos;s nothing here ?
&quot; well , let &apos;s make something clear &quot;
- I think I &apos;ll be the one to make that call - But you &apos;ll call ?
and though you look so cute in your polyester suit
it &apos;s wool .
&quot; you &apos;re right , I &apos;d never fall for you at all &quot;
and maybe this appeals To someone not in heels
or to any girl who feels there &apos;s some chance for romance
- But I &apos;m frankly feeling nothing - Is that so ?
or it could be less than nothing
good to know so you agree ?
that &apos;s right
what a way to waste of a lovely night
&quot; Hi , Greg . &quot;
&quot; Hi . Oh , sorry I &apos;m late . &quot;
Yeah . very soon . Okay . Bye .
do you want a ride to your car ?
&quot; No , I &apos;m just right up here . &quot;
good night .
good night .
&quot; Excuse me . this is gluten free , right ? &quot;
- No - What ?
I &apos;d like a refund .
Okay . let me check it out .
&quot; Mia , you &apos;re closing Friday . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t close on Friday . I have an audition , remember ? &quot;
do I look like I care ? we schedule it .
&quot; Oh and we need to have a little talk tomorrow , okay ? &quot;
&quot; - Fix your apron , please . - Okay . &quot;
you again !
what are you doing here ?
&quot; you know , just meetings and studio heads .. &quot;
How did you get on the lot ?
I basically just run past the guard gates .
&quot; - You have a break coming up , do you ? - I &apos;m off in ten minutes . &quot;
can I hide in the bathroom ?
- Yes . - Okay .
sorry .
I actually do have to check . I &apos;m sorry .
that &apos;s the window that Humphrey Bogart
and Ingrid Bergman looked out of in Casablanca .
- Wow . - Yeah .
I can &apos;t believe you work right across the street from there .
- Yeah . - That &apos;s amazing .
&quot; what was you &apos;re , uh , you &apos;re Bogart &apos;s name ? &quot;
what &apos;s his name ? is it Greg ?
&quot; Yeah , Greg . &quot;
right . How long have you been ... ?
we &apos;ve been seeing each other for about a month .
that &apos;s great .
&quot; it &apos;s sweet . anyway , I love being around this stuff . &quot;
you know ?
I know what you mean . I get coffee 5 miles out of the way ...
- just so I can be near a jazz club . - Really ?
&quot; Yeah , the Van Beek . do you know it ? &quot;
all the big swing bands used to play there .
&quot; Count Basie , Chick Webb . &quot;
&quot; anyway , it &apos;s a samba-tapas place now ... &quot;
so ...
what &apos;s a samba-tapas place ?
&quot; you know , it &apos;s like a samba place where they serve tapas . &quot;
- Oh . - Yeah . so the joke &apos;s on ... history ?
I dont know . that &apos;s L.A .
they just - They worship everything and they value nothing .
we &apos;re about to roll . stop please guys .
- You &apos;re rolling ? - Yeah .
they shoot movies on my street all the time so no problem .
- Come this way . - Right .
it &apos;s a lockdown .
- I love her ! - And here we go .
&quot; Hey , Mia . How did you get into this ? &quot;
- And ... roll ! - Get into what ?
&quot; - You know , movies , acting . - Action ! &quot;
&quot; - My aunt was an actress . - Oh , okay . &quot;
she was in a traveling theatre company .
&quot; I grew up in Boulder City , Nevada . &quot;
&quot; so across the street from my house , there was this little library .. &quot;
that had an old movies section .
so she- she took me and spent an entire day
watching all these old movies ...
&quot; like &quot; &quot; Notorious &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; Bringing Up Baby , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casablanca &quot; &quot; and ... &quot;
- Cut it there ! cut ! check the tapes .
- We can talk now . - She sounds incredible .
she was incredible . and I would put on all these plays in my bedroom ...
and it would basically just she and I ...
reenacting the scenes from the movies .
- And then I wrote my own plays . Yeah . - Wow .
I love it .
&quot; so anyway , I left college after two years to come here . &quot;
and my last audition was for a teen soap ...
pitched as Dangerous Minds meets The OC .
&quot; so yeah , should &apos;ve been a lawyer . &quot;
&apos;Cause the world needs more lawyers .
doesn &apos;t need more actresses .
you &apos;re not just an actress .
&quot; what do you mean &quot; &quot; just an actress &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
you said it yourself . you were a child prodigy playwright .
that is not what I said .
&quot; well , you &apos;re too modest to say it but it &apos;s true . &quot;
&quot; so you could just write your own roles , you know . &quot;
write something that &apos;s as interesting as you are ...
- and you don &apos;t have to audition for this pishi kaka . - Yeah .
&quot; look at Louis Armstrong , you know . &quot;
he could have just played the marching band charts that he was given .
- But he didn &apos;t do it . what did he do ? - What did he do ?
&quot; well , I &apos;m gonna stop auditioning and I &apos;m gonna make history instead . &quot;
&quot; well , my work is done here . &quot;
I should probably tell you something now .
to get it out the way .
I hate jazz .
you okay ?
what do you mean you hate jazz ?
&quot; it just means that when I listen to it , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
Yeah but it &apos;s just a blanket statement that you don &apos;t like jazz .
what are you doing right now ?
nothing .
&quot; you know , I just think that when people say that , &quot;
&quot; you know , hate jazz .. &quot;
they just- they don &apos;t have context . they don &apos;t know where it comes from .
you know ?
jazz was born in a little flophouse in New Orleans ...
&quot; and just because people were crammed in there , they spoke five different languages . &quot;
they couldn &apos;t talk to each other .
the only way that they could communicate was with jazz .
&quot; you know , what about Kenny G ? &quot;
what ?
&quot; what about Kenny G ? I mean , what about elevator music ? &quot;
&quot; you know , jazz music that I know . &quot;
- What about it ? - From my life .
I just- I mean find it relaxing .
it &apos;s not relaxing . it &apos;s not .
it &apos;s not !
Sidney Bechet shot somebody ...
because he told him he played a wrong note .
that &apos;s hardly relaxing .
&quot; where I grew up , there was this station called KJAZZ 103 . &quot;
and people would just put on that station when they had a cocktail party ...
right .
and everyone would just kind of talk over it .
- I know . - Yes . it was ..
&quot; Okay , okay . so I think that that &apos;s ... &quot;
&quot; part of the problem is that you can &apos;t hear it , you know . &quot;
&quot; you have to see it , you have to see what &apos;s at stake . &quot;
&quot; I mean , look at these fellas . look at the saxophonist right now . &quot;
he just hijacked the song . he &apos;s on his own trail .
&quot; everyone of these guys are composing , rearranging , they &apos;re writing ... &quot;
and they &apos;re playing the melody . they &apos;re just ...
&quot; and now look , the trumpet player . he &apos;s got his own idea . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s so- it &apos;s conflict and it &apos;s compromise , and it &apos;s just ... &quot;
it &apos;s new every time . it &apos;s brand new every night .
&quot; it &apos;s very , very exciting . &quot;
and it &apos;s dying .
&quot; it &apos;s dying , Mia . it &apos;s dying on the vine . &quot;
&quot; and the world says , &quot; &quot; Let it die . it had its time &quot; &quot; . &quot;
&quot; well , not on my watch . &quot;
what are you gonna do ?
I &apos;ll have my own club .
- Really ? - Yes .
&quot; we &apos;re gonna play whatever we want , whenever we want ... &quot;
&quot; however we want , as long as it &apos;s pure jazz . &quot;
&quot; Hi , this is Mia Dolan . &quot;
&quot; Yeah , I just missed a call . &quot;
- I got a callback ! - What ?
come on ! for what ?
for a TV show . the one I was telling you about .
- The Dangerous Minds meets The OC ? - Yeah .
- Congratulations ! that &apos;s incredible ! - It &apos;s really exciting .
- I feel like I said negative stuff about if before . - What ?
&quot; it &apos;s like &quot; &quot; Rebel Without a Cause &quot; &quot; sort of . &quot;
I got the bullets !
- You &apos;ve never seen it ! - I &apos;ve never seen it .
Oh my . you know it &apos;s playing in the Rialto .
- Really ? - Yes .
&quot; you should go . I mean , I- I can take you . &quot;
&quot; - Okay . - You know , for research . &quot;
- For research . Yeah . - Yeah .
Okay .
&quot; Monday night , ten o &apos;clock . &quot;
- Yeah . great . - Okay .
for research .
City of stars are you shining just for me ?
City of stars there &apos;s so much that I can &apos;t see
who knows ?
is this the start of something wonderful ?
or one more dream that I cannot make true ?
- Stand there please . - Okay . nice to meet you .
- Hi . - Hi .
- On your own time . - Okay .

&quot; you either follow my rules , or follow my rules . Capisce ? &quot;

&quot; Oh , it &apos;s like being in a movie theater . &quot;
&quot; well , better than being in a theater , really . &quot;
- I can &apos;t wait . - You know theaters these days .
- Yeah . - They &apos;re so dirty .
&quot; Yeah , I know . they smell bad . &quot;
&quot; - And they &apos;re either too hot or too cold . - I know , the quality has gone far and off . &quot;
&quot; Oh , it &apos;s terrible and there &apos;s always people talking . &quot;
- Many people . - Oh it &apos;s ...
- I &apos;m sorry . just- hold on a second .
- Hello ? - It &apos;s probably work .
&quot; sorry . so you know , we love it . &quot;
- It &apos;s so nice . - Well you have to come .
you should come by .
I have one more for you man : Indonesia .
I don &apos;t know . I never heard anyone say that .
&quot; I know , you know I can &apos;t even keep track of it but honestly , it was just life changing . &quot;
- Really . - Yeah .
- Is it amazing ?
- Yes . - A five-star jungle-eco resort .
&quot; - Well , you would not believe . - Amazing . &quot;
we were thinking about going to Nicaragua .
I think Nicaragua is less developed .
- It &apos;s a bit underdeveloped . - Right .
- It &apos;s a little more . - I just- I don &apos;t know- I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s safe there .
- Yeah . Yeah . - I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s safe .
I &apos;m sorry !
I have an idea .
nan
nan
what is that ? is that a script ?
- It &apos;s a play . - A play ?
you better give us all roles !
&quot; actually , it &apos;s a one woman show . &quot;
so I can &apos;t .
Wow . is that gonna happen everytime ?
I think so .
wait ! it &apos;s one way .
nan
nan
Sebastian !
&quot; - Keith . - Come here , man . &quot;
&quot; - How are you ? - Very good , man . &quot;
&quot; this is Mia . Mia , Keith . &quot;
- Hi Mia . nice to meet you . - Nice to meet you .
I used to play with this guy .
we went to school together .
- So how you been brother ? - Great .
never been better . How about you ?
I &apos;ve been really good . been very busy .
- I got a new combo . - Okay .
cool .
we &apos;re looking for keys .
&quot; - Are you kidding me ? - No , I &apos;m not kidding . &quot;
&quot; - No , I &apos;m good . - You sure ? it pays . &quot;
I &apos;m good .
let &apos;s just grab a drink then .
it &apos;s been too long .
- Okay . nice to meet you Mia . - Nice to meet you .
the end .
it &apos;s ...
Genius !
- Really ? - Yes .
it feels really nostalgic to me .
- That &apos;s the point . - Is it too nostalgic ?
- That &apos;s ... - Are people gonna like it ?
Fuck &apos; em !
&quot; - You always say that . - Well , I truly believe that . &quot;
- I made you something . - For what ?
for your club .
&quot; why does it say &quot; &quot; Seb &apos;s &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
&quot; &apos; Cause I think you should call it &quot; &quot; Seb &apos;s &quot; &quot; . &quot;
what ?
&quot; &apos; Cause no one &apos;s gonna come to &quot; &quot; Chicken on a Stick &quot; &quot; . &quot;
- Is that a music note ? is it an apostrophe ? - Yes .
&quot; that &apos;s pretty cool . it &apos;s gotta be &quot; &quot; Chicken on a Stick &quot; &quot; . &quot;
because Charlie Parker got his nickname ...
I know because he loves chicken .
&quot; that &apos;s why they call him &quot; &quot; Bird &quot; &quot; . &quot;
&quot; so I &apos;m gonna have chicken , beer , jazz . chicken on a Stick &quot;
&quot; I know.I think you should drop the chicken , &quot;
&quot; and just have drinks and jazz , and ... &quot;
- also there could be ... - I &apos;m not dropping the chicken .
you could maybe do it somewhere else .
find a new spot ?
- It &apos;s gotta be the Van Beek . - It doesn &apos;t have to be the Van Beek .
I can &apos;t let them samba all over its history .
I can &apos;t do it .
- You can let them but you refuse to . - Your play &apos;s incredible .
you know ? the whole world from your bedroom .
what else do they want ? who &apos;s doing that ?
- I &apos;m doing that . - You &apos;re doing that .
who was that guy in The Lighthouse ?
- The guy that offered you the gig ? - Keith .
Yeah . why was it so weird between you two ?
it &apos;s- it &apos;s just always weird with him .
- Really ? - Yeah .
but he seemed kinda nice because he did offer you a job .
are you gonna call him ?
- No . No . - All right .
so ...
- Here &apos;s what we know . - Yeah .
&quot; it &apos;s definitely &quot; &quot; Chicken on a Stick &quot; &quot; ... &quot;
and your play &apos;s gonna be a triumph .
it &apos;s a one woman show .
so it &apos;s just me .
&quot; No , I mean I &apos;m acting in it . &quot;
&quot; No , Mom , I &apos;m not getting paid . I &apos;m paying to do it . &quot;
&quot; he &apos;s great . he &apos;s gonna open his own jazz club . Yeah , it &apos;s gonna be incredible . &quot;
uh no . he &apos;s- he &apos;s nobody yet . he needs um ..
&quot; he &apos;s saving up , I think . &quot;
No but he doesn &apos;t have a steady gig .
but he &apos;s- he &apos;s figuring it out . it &apos;s just been a little too gilly lately .
&quot; Mom , he &apos;s gonna find a way to open it and you &apos;re gonna love it . &quot;
Okay ?
How &apos;s Dad ?
&quot; Sebastian . come on in , man . &quot;
- Thanks for coming . - Thanks for having me .
I wasn &apos;t sure I &apos;d see you today .
- So here &apos;s the deal . - Okay .
we got distribution with Universal . we got our own imprint .
we &apos;re about to go on the road .
we can pay you a thousand bucks a week ...
plus a cut of the ticket revenue and merchandising . sound good ?
- Sebastian ? - Yup .
all right .
- Let &apos;s play . - Okay .
nan
I know . it &apos;s different .
but you say you want to save jazz .
How are you gonna save jazz if no one &apos;s listening ?
jazz is dying because of people like you .
you play into 90 year olds at The Lighthouse .
where are the kids ? where are the young people ?
you &apos;re so obsessed with Kenny Clarke and Thelonious Monk .
these guys were revolutionaries .
&quot; How are you going to be a revolutionary , if you &apos;re such a traditionalist ? &quot;
&quot; you holding on to the past , but jazz is about the future . &quot;
&quot; I know . the other guy , he wasn &apos;t as good as you . &quot;
&quot; but you &apos;re a pain in the ass , man . &quot;
City of stars Are you shining just for me ?
who knows ?
I felt it from the first embrace I shared with you
that now our dreams they &apos;ve finally come true
City of stars
just one thing everybody wants
there in the bars
and through the smokescreen
of the crowded restaurants
it &apos;s love
&quot; Yes , all we &apos;re looking for is love from someone else &quot;
- A rush - A glance
- A touch - A dance
a look in somebody &apos;s eyes
to light up the skies
to open the world and send it reeling
&quot; a voice that says , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll be here and you &apos;ll be alright &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t care if I know just where I will go
&apos;Cause all that i need &apos;s this crazy feeling
the rat-tat-tat on my heart
I think I want it to stay

- Come to Boise ? - Yeah .
&apos;Cause I have to rehearse .
Yeah but can &apos;t you rehearse anywhere ?
anywhere you are ?
I mean- I guess .
&quot; well , all my stuff is here and it &apos;s in two weeks . so I don &apos;t think really think that would be ... &quot;
Okay .
&quot; - the best idea right now , but ... - Right . &quot;
I wish I could .
&quot; we &apos;re just gonna have to try and see each other , you know , so that we see each other . &quot;
I know but when are you done ?
what do you mean ? I mean ...
when you &apos;re finish with the whole tour ?
&quot; after we finish , we &apos;re gonna go to recording &quot;
and then we &apos;ll go back on tour .
&quot; you know , we tour so we can make the records ... &quot;
so we can go back to tour the record .
so it &apos;s like the long haul ?
&quot; what do you mean the &quot; &quot; long haul &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
I mean the long haul that you &apos;re gonna stay in this band ...
for a long time .
on tour .
&quot; I mean , what did you think I was going to do ? &quot;
I don &apos;t ...
I hadn &apos;t really thought it through . I didn &apos;t know that the band ...
- You didn &apos;t think we would be successful . - would be important .
&quot; No , that &apos;s not really what I mean . I just mean that y-you ... &quot;
I mean ... You &apos;ll be on tour for what ? Months now ? years ?
Yeah I don &apos;t mean- this is it ...
&quot; I mean , this is- it could feasibly be- yeah for .. &quot;
I could be on tour with this ...
&quot; for a couple of years at least , just this record . &quot;
do you like the music you &apos;re playing ?
I don &apos;t ...
I don &apos;t know ... what- what it matters .
&quot; well , it matters because ... &quot;
if you &apos;re going to give up your dream . I think it matters ...
that you like what you &apos;re playing
on the road for years .
do you like the music that I play ?
Yeah .
I do .
I just didn &apos;t think that you did .
Yeah well ...
&quot; you know , you said Keith is the worst &quot;
&quot; and now you &apos;re gonna be on tour with him for years , so I just didn &apos;t ... &quot;
- I don &apos;t know what- What are you doing right now ? - know if you were happy .
&quot; - Why are you doing this ? - I don &apos;t- What do you mean &quot; &quot; why are you doing this &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
I thought you wanted me to do this and it just sounds like now you don &apos;t want me to do it .
what do you mean I wanted you to do this ?
this is what you wanted for me .
to be in this band ?
to be in a band to have a steady job . you know .
T-to be ... you know .
&quot; of course , I wanted you to have a steady job ... &quot;
so that you can take care of yourself and your life and you could start your club .
Yes so I &apos;m doing that so I don &apos;t understand- I mean why aren &apos;t we celebrating ?
why aren &apos;t you starting your club ?
you said yourself no one wants to go to that club .
&quot; No one wants to go to a club called &quot; &quot; Chicken on a Stick &quot; &quot; . &quot;
so change the name !
&quot; well , no one likes jazz ! not even you ! &quot;
I do like jazz now because of you !
and this is what I thought you wanted me to do !
what am I supposed to do ? go back to playing Jingle Bells ?
- I &apos;m not saying that ! I &apos;m saying why don &apos;t you take ... - Scrutting pennies so I can ...
- what you &apos;ve made and start the club ! - start a club that no one wants to go ?
people will wanna go to it ...
because you &apos;re passionate about it ...
and people love what other people are passionate about .
- You remind people of what they &apos;ve forgotten . - Not in my experience .
&quot; well , whatever alright . it &apos;s- it &apos;s time to grow up , you know . &quot;
&quot; I have a steady job , this is what I &apos;m doing . &quot;
&quot; and now all of a sudden if you had these problems , I wish you would &apos;ve said them earlier ... &quot;
before I signed on the goddamn dotted line !
&quot; I &apos;m pointing out that you had a dream that you followed , that you were sticking ... &quot;
this is the dream ! this is the dream !
- This is not your dream ! - Guys like me ...
&quot; work their whole lives to be in something that &apos;s successful , &quot;
that people like . you know ?
&quot; I mean , I &apos;m finally in something th-th-th-th-that people enjoy . &quot;
&quot; - Since when do you care about being liked ? - Just because I don &apos;t enjoy it , it doesn &apos;t matter . &quot;
why do you care so much you about being liked ?
you are an actress ! what are you talking about ?

because it made you feel better about yourself .
- Are you kidding ? - No .

or I &apos;m crying and they start laughing !
or there &apos;s people sitting in the waiting room ...
and they &apos;re and they &apos;re ...
like me but prettier ...
and better at the- because maybe I &apos;m not good enough !
&quot; - Yes , you are . - No . &quot;
- Maybe I &apos;m not . - You are .
maybe I &apos;m one of those people who always wanted to do it ...
&quot; but it &apos;s like a pipe dream for me , you know ? &quot;
you said it : you change your dreams and then you grow up .
maybe I &apos;m one of those people and I &apos;m not supposed to .
and I can go back to school and find something else that I &apos;m supposed to do .
&apos;Cause I left to do that ...
and it &apos;s been six years and I don &apos;t wanna do it anymore .
why ?
- Why what ? - Why don &apos;t you wanna do it anymore ?
because I think it hurts a little bit too much .

Mia ?
&quot; Hi , Mia . I &apos;m Amy and this is Frank . &quot;
&quot; - Hi , how are you ? - Pleasure to meet you . &quot;
- I &apos;m glad we found you . - Me too .
the film shoots in Paris and we don &apos;t have a script .
it &apos;s gonna be a process . we &apos;re gonna build the character around the actress .
it &apos;s a three-month rehearsal and a four-month shoot .
Okay .
and we thought you could just tell us a story .
- About ? - Just tell us anything .
- Anything ? - Yes . tell us a story . you &apos;re a storyteller .
whenever you &apos;re ready .
my aunt used to live in Paris .
&quot; I remember , she used to come home and she would tell us ... &quot;
these stories about being abroad and ...
I remember she told us that she jumped into the river once ...
Barefoot .
she smiled ...
Leapt ...
without looking
and tumbled into ...
the Seine
the water was freezing
she spent a month sneezing
but said she would do it again
here &apos;s to the ones who dream
Foolish as they may seem
here &apos;s to the hearts that ache
here &apos;s to the mess we made
she captured a feeling Sky with no ceiling
the sunset inside a frame
she lived in her liquor And died with a flicker
I &apos;ll always remember the flame
here &apos;s to the ones who dream
Foolish as they may seem
here &apos;s to the hearts that ache
here &apos;s to the mess we made
she told me ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of madeness is key &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to give us new colors to see &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; who knows where it will lead us ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s why they need us &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bring on the rebels
the ripples from pebbles
&quot; the painters , and poets , and plays &quot;
and here &apos;s to the fools who dream
crazy as they may seem
here &apos;s to the hearts that break
here &apos;s to the mess we made
I trace it all back to then
&quot; her , and the snow , and the Seine &quot;
Smiling trough it
she said she &apos;d do it
again
when do you find out ?
they said the next couple of days .
but I &apos;m not expecting to find anything out .

- If I get this . - When you get this ...

everything . it &apos;s your dream .
what are you gonna do ?
I gotta follow my own plan . you know ?
