Ah , this is greasy . I want to eat kimchee .
is Chae Yoon &apos;s coordinator in here ?
excuse me , aren &apos;t you Chae Yoon &apos;s coordinator ?
Yes . me ?
-Chae Yoon is done singing .
this lady right next to me ... everyone knows who she is right ?
she is my forever idol ... she is my rival whom I can never win against , she is the one who always makes me happy , and she is my mother .
everyone should remember my mom as one of the greatest movie stars , but instead of becoming an actress , she wanted to become a singer just like me .
when I was stressed and exhausted , she &apos;d always sing me a song while having me on her lap .
today , I would like to share that moment with everyone .
watch out ! watch Out !
you cannot work yourself out .
you &apos;re not normal .
in your head , there is still a bullet left .
didn &apos;t you hear it from the doctor ...
you &apos;re back , are you ?
I knew you would be .
... I knew you would .
go to Korea .
I packed your airplane ticket , some clothes and enough money to last you till you die .
hurry up and go .
it &apos;s this evening &apos;s flight .
Jason is trying to kill you .
that car a while ago was sent by Jason .
he burned all the pictures we &apos;ve taken together .
I &apos;m sorry that this is what I can do for you .
you saved our lives , but I can only do this for you and I &apos;m very sorry .
if he kills me , then I &apos;ll die .
go to our country and die , Moonhyuk .
Oh poison !
you tasted this and died . Oh careless love !
why die and not a drop of poison left for me ?
Oh sword ...
my heart be the dagger &apos;s sheath .
let me to death !
lead me to Romeo .
let &apos;s have you come out as an entertainer .
you might get nominated for an academic award . when did you come ?
I thought it would take about 30 minutes .
Hey sister ...
I think it &apos;s time for you to come out to the world .
let &apos;s go to the studio .
I &apos;ll be your manager .
a customer came to buy a laundry machine and took a catalogue .
stop fooling around and do a great job !
I &apos;m going .
how long will you keep suffering inside to be Yoon &apos;s coordinator ?
I think you have the potential to be great . I &apos;m not saying just because I &apos;m your sister .
well you might not be good as Kang Min Joo ... but you ...
I know myself more than you .
you do well .
do you know how hard it was for me to get you employed here with the help of Yoon .
if you get fired ...
Yoon ?
okay . I &apos;ll be there soon .
what did Yoon do now ?
seriously there &apos;s not a day where you can just relax . I &apos;m going to go .
see you at home . - Okay , go . go .
I also had an accident .
they told me to work only today and not come back from tomorrow .
my swearing boss said .
he &apos;s handsome .
if he were rich , how great that would be .
Ah , he &apos;s handsome .
Cha Moonhyuk , it is true that you were adopted right ?
Yes .
you must not have memories of your mother or the country Korea .
I don &apos;t remember anything .
I hope everyone forgives cha moonhyuk &apos;s speaking .
he didn &apos;t learn the proper speaking of Korean
I hope everyone understands him . Yes , let &apos;s bring Cha Moonhyuk on stage .
to find your family , is there any special things you can do or have anything that was given to you before you were adopted .
we &apos;re on live right now .
this must be a remembered necklace .
so is this what you had when you were adopted ?
when and how did you get it ?
-Don &apos;t know .
can you please show it in front of the camera .
that necklace is pretty .
where did I see that .
it doesn &apos;t seem like a necklace from here .
can you get out and ask the lady where she got that necklace ?
can you ask ? Yes , yes ma &apos;am .
is that platinum or silver ?
put it back on !
we have to keep watching so we can find you &apos;re family .
no ...
I &apos;m going to watch &apos; Janggoo &apos; . wait a second .
I &apos;m going to watch &apos; janggoo &apos; . !
after reading this , he disappeared during the rehearsal .
a woman is is the way ... ( he misreads )
to a woman ... haht .. hah &apos; ....
you &apos;re dumb , how can you not know how to read korean ?
Hey , where are you hitting my child ?
what a strange man .

Yoon , please don &apos;t do this .

I seriously don &apos;t understand that girl .

studio ?
Chae Moonhyuk .
nice to meet you . let &apos;s go .
no , I want to drink this .
-Mom , you order that one .
I ordered the Coke
no , I orderd the cola .
-After watching the show , that little boy gave us a call ..
he told us that his mother has the same exact looking necklace as yours .
it &apos;s mine !
it &apos;s because my mom had an accident along time ago .
at age seven , a grandpa told me that she got hit by a trunk infront of a church and hurt her head .
this ... read it .
read what &apos;s incribed in your ring .
don &apos;t know .
can &apos;t your mother read ?
is your mom stupid to read words ?
-She &apos;s not stupid .
if she can &apos;t read , how is she not stupid ?
it &apos;s because she hasn &apos;t learned all the alphabet .
she can read up to gah , nah , dah , lah , mah , bah , sah .
read what &apos;s written .
For-ev-er ... ? forever ?
you can &apos;t read words too ? there are some words I can , and some words I can &apos;t .
I &apos;m not stupid .
compare to your mom , I &apos;m a 1000 times smarter !
Forver ... together ...
you do you know me ?
you ...
who are you ?
who are you ?
Suh Kyung .
Yoon Suh Kyung .
Eunchae , let &apos;s go home and make and eat spicy rice cake . ok ...

without any dusk , I &apos;m going to completely erase her .
Bye Kang Min Joo . it &apos;s goodbye forever !

I &apos;ll say something and go .
so you go home first .

I do .
I &apos;m drinking soju and I &apos;ll come back .
want to wait for me ?
I &apos;ll take a shot , come back , and do something about Minjoo
I &apos;ll tell her not to make you sad and grab her hair and shake .
I &apos;ll break her legs so that she can &apos;t meet anyone .
yah , it &apos;s time for her to get beaten up .
wait a second , I &apos;ll be back .
-Don &apos;t lay a hand on her .
it &apos;s not Minjoo &apos;s fault
she &apos;s already warned me first .
I &apos;m the crazy one .
I &apos;ll wait . finish him off and come back .
it &apos;s also find if you come without finishing him .
I &apos;ll finish it off for you .
you probably have to wait along time .
I started to date him just a week ago .
I can wait . a month is enough right ? - Chae Yoon .

together ... Forever
it &apos;s scary to see a scab fall off !
I &apos;m alright , it doesn &apos;t hurt .

I say that I &apos;m alright because I &apos;m alright , and it doesn &apos;t hurt because it doesn &apos;t hurt .

I met him when I followed Yoon to shoot his CF .
I got helped a lot .
-you have a boyfriend ?

Eunchae !
-Going somewhere ? to see my brother .
-Brother ?
Oh good ... eat this .
-What is this ?

added some honey on the mountain ginseng or something like that . eat it .
how can I eat this fragile thing ?
-Because it is , you should eat it . I don &apos;t want to .
your mother bought it for you .
Hey ,
I can &apos;t eat this .

you eat it .
then I &apos;m throwing it away .
why can &apos;t you eat this ?
my mouth is my mouth .
is your mouth dirty then ? Yoon ...
give it so I can give it to a dog .
-Hey , Ok ! I &apos;ll eat it .

my mom says she feels great when feeding me delicious food .
I feel great when I do the same for you .
probably in the past , I might have been your mom or dad .
eat well and grow a lot , ok ?
Yes ? -Yoon , put this on and go .
what is that ?
-This is milk oil .
it &apos;s great for dark circles .
-Who has dark circles ?
so we have to prepare for it beforehand .
I feel like dying when I see your handsome face get dirty .
Eunchae , so what happened with that guy ?
guy ?
-Sure . Eunchae &apos;s got a boyfriend .
she has a boyfriend ?
Eunchae ?
who is it ? what does he do ?
-He must be sensitive .
he was even crying .
Eunchae , do a good job .
if you make someone else cry ,
then your eyes will cry blood .
good luck , Eunchae .
congratulations , you wicked girl !
what the heck kind of guy is he ? Eunchae has no sense for understanding guys .
why am I feeling upset ?
get in !
water tastes great , doesn &apos;t it ? I had a cramp .
I almost died .
you can &apos;t reveal your fear to God ...
you have to crush it first .
that &apos;s the only way you make friends with him
when &apos;d you learn how to swim ?
I didn &apos;t learn .
you weren &apos;t taught ?
but I haven &apos;t learned either .
then what do I do to become as good as you ? try your best !
-Then I guess I should come here more often .
but I don &apos;t swim !
when I think of my mother ,
I feel grateful and I start to cry ,
she gave birth to me , and raised me well .
and giving me so much love .
mom , you are my sunshine and idol .
how is it ?
-It &apos;s good .
but this place ... it seems ...
look over here .
Stripes look great on Yoon .
this is the fifth , ma &apos;am .
-Oh yeah ?
this style wouldn &apos;t work on anyone but Yoon , right ?
but , ma &apos;am , this please is extremely expensive .
red is great on my son as well .
one second ...
having a great son it hard work too , sis .
Yes ,
Yoon ?
you can &apos;t reach him ?
he said he was going to meet up with his &quot; brother &quot; .
I don &apos;t know what he was talking about .
newspapers ?
no , I didn &apos;t see them .
what ? &quot; Kang Minjoo &apos;s fling with Chae Yoon &quot;
&quot; Kang Minjoo reveals all :

and so will she .
no one better stop me .

wait , just one more round ...
isn &apos;t this too much ?
go explain yourself to Yoon .
it seems the interview is out ...
you wanna die ?
you wanna get beat ? you have any idea how much Yoon loved you ?
Yoon , the guy you cheated on .
sorry .
but I can &apos;t change who I am .
you know I &apos;m a flirt by nature .
why do you live this way ?
is this the way you want to live ?
why do you live so recklessly ?
want to end your career ?
are you a rock head ? are you an idiot ?
have you decided to end it all ? you idiot , you dummy , you moron !
you done hitting me ?
is that all the power you got ?
at least you should break a rib or something .
Yoon ... I think I like him .
I think because of that ...
maybe because I was really starting to like him ...
that &apos;s why I did it . what ?
you like Yoon , don &apos;t you ?
I &apos;m a romance scholar .
you think I wouldn &apos;t know ?
I knew since a long time ago . who &apos;s heard of a friendship between a guy and girl ?
what is this girl talking about ?
do you really want to be beat today ?
still
I wanted to go all the way , but I couldn &apos;t because of you .
you have him . you can have him .
that &apos;s right .
you should be beat !
you need a beating to get you back to your senses .
I &apos;m going to beat you to a pulp !
you &apos;re dead , Kang Minjoo !
can &apos;t you stop that , Eunchae ?
what do you think you &apos;re doing ?
what gives you the right to hit her ?
no one lays a finger on her !
Yoon !
mind your business from now on .
don &apos;t meddle in ours , Eunchae .
don &apos;t overreact .
you got it ?
go out !
didn &apos;t you hear me ? get the hell out !
I &apos;m still owe you one .
don &apos;t get hit again ,
.. from me or Eunchae .
if someone does this again ,
I &apos;m going to kill em .
be it Eunchae , or me .
I &apos;ll kill them all .
don &apos;t do that again .
you &apos;ll die too .
and I &apos;ll die .
I &apos;m sorry .
I won &apos;t be that way again . I &apos;m sorry .
poor baby .
are you lost ?
don &apos;t cry . don &apos;t cry , ok ?
I &apos;ll find your mother for you .
crying is bad .
Santa Clause doesn &apos;t give presents to children who cry .
so don &apos;t cry .
Hello ? this is Perry &apos;s mother , right ?
Hi , I &apos;m Song Eunchae ...
what &apos;s the capitol of Australia ?
don &apos;t you even know the capital of your own country ? Canberra .

-Canberra .
was it changed ?
what about our country ?
Seoul .
so you &apos;re not demented .
let &apos;s go out .
are you embarrassed ? is looking at my face difficult for you ?
you &apos;re introverted , I see .
I didn &apos;t think so .
try some of mine . this is what couples do when they go out .
it &apos;s called being affectionate .
you &apos;re so cute .
-Please be quiet .
I &apos;ll be asleep for 5 minutes , so please .. be quiet .
are you ok ? Hey !
wake up ! get it together !

-It &apos;s ok . you eat it .

-I don &apos;t eat eaten food .
but Eunchae does .
she has the stomach for that .
am I a stranger ? -Sorry .
that &apos;s my personality .
I don &apos;t eat from my mother &apos;s leftovers either .
do you get home safe , Eunchae ?
about before ...
I was out of line .
you &apos;re not upset , are you ?
actually , I didn &apos;t mean to offend you .
why isn &apos;t she saying anything ? Hello ?
isn &apos;t this Song Eunchae &apos;s cell phone ?
-The owner has fainted .
her dad says he &apos;s coming now .
where is over there ?
sir , sir !

they won &apos;t even budge . pardon me !

how did Moohyuk and Eunchae end up together ?
is he someone you know ?
-How do you know him ?
he &apos;s just a guy I like .
what does he do ?
I &apos;m not sure either .
Yoon ! -Yes ? what exactly does Eunchae like ?
chicken , rice ...
-What doesn &apos;t she like ?
ghosts , orangutans , hospitals ..
why do you ask ? because I &apos;m her father ...
yet I don &apos;t know a lot about her .
you &apos;ve spent more time with her than me , right ?
Yes .
you &apos;ll probably know her more than I do .
right ?

is Eunchae promiscuous ?
what ? let go .
you &apos;re so strange .
just leave it .
I &apos;ll fold it up later . what ? did you piss the bed ?
Minchae , conference time !

I &apos;m late for school .
yesterday , who brought me home ?
-Dad did .
mom &apos;s having a fit because of you so run like hell when you see her .
you ... would you look at my lips ...
what about them ?
how is it ? does it look they &apos;ve been kissed ?
I &apos;m not sure if it was a dream or not ...
it doesn &apos;t seem like it was a dream ...
look at them . do they look like they &apos;ve been kissed ?
what do kissed lips look like anyway ?
since I never kissed anyone .
-What did you do yesterday ?
well , exactly ....
but you &apos;ve read a lot of weird books , so wouldn &apos;t you know ?
I wouldn &apos;t know either ...
want me to get the magnifying glass ?
your lips seem bruised and swollen .
push them out more .
in my estimation , you were kissed .
they say the body remembers what your brain doesn &apos;t .
kiss that guy again .
what ?
kiss .
-you crazy ?
whatever . forget it !
sister !
I &apos;m not liking these dishes .
where might the Italian china be ?

-Who ?
Ah , that &apos;s Moohyuk . -Why is he at our house .
I brought him over last night .
he was too drunk .

I don &apos;t feel alive .
what are your feelings toward Chae Yoon ?
Chae Yoon is the nicest and most honest man I know .
I &apos;ve done him a lot of wrong ,

I didn &apos;t think love was real ,
but through Yoon , I &apos;ve come to believe .
he &apos;s scary , just tell him to leave .
do whatever you want .
both of them have opened their hearts and the public agrees they match well .
they &apos;re rising in popularity .
due to today &apos;s conference , the issue is getting hot .
live happily , Yoon !
if you hurt him , I won &apos;t leave you alone , Minjoo !

if you look at me close enough ...
I might be your type . - I can tell in one minute .

he &apos;s older than you are .
are you on drugs today ?
from this point on , I &apos;m not you &apos;re coordinator .
hire someone else . sorry , sorry , sorry .
we &apos;re late because of me , right ?
mom , Eunchae says she won &apos;t be my coordinator from today .
why ? -Don &apos;t know .
she says I should hire someone else .
-Why , Eunchae ? did Yoon do something wrong again ?
how could he hire anyone else ?
except for you , no one can handle Yoon .
it &apos;s not that .
-Our Yoon ...
I &apos;ll scorn him later .
lets go right now , we &apos;re late .
lets go .
you ?
he &apos;s my manager since yesterday , mom .
you know Moohyuk , right ?
it must be &apos; that day &apos; for Eunchae .
she &apos;s weird .
she says I &apos;m disgusting .
and a while ago , she swore at Moohyuk .
she &apos;s random , that girl .
-She is a grown-up woman ... don &apos;t call her girl .
that person , Eunchae did you get him to work ?
no .
no , ma &apos;am .
isn &apos;t he your boyfriend , Eunchae ? no , nothing like that .
later ... if you ask me who I &apos;d choose between Moohyuk and you ,
I &apos;d choose Moohyuk !
got that ! why ?
because Moohyuk is cool !
he &apos;s not a snob like you .
if anyone talks foul about him again ,
I won &apos;t leave that person alone , no matter who .
got it ?
if I &apos;m a star , I &apos;m a star .
no , dirty and filthy ... and disgusting right ?
you should at least say something .
Yoon . -What ?
let &apos;s break away with no hard feelings .
it &apos;s our last day , so I want to end it nicely .
are you really going to quit ?
I am going to quit .
today is my last day .
Eunchae , you finish it off .
mother , Eunchae is really going to quit today .
son ...
if you were to ask me to choose between Eunchae and that Moohyuk guy or whatever ... I &apos;d pick Eunchae all the way .
what is wrong with everyone ! -I don &apos;t like that guy either .
why ?
what don &apos;t you like about him ?
-Just because . I don &apos;t like him .
so cut your stubbornness ..
but he &apos;s a really cool guy .
you don &apos;t even know him .
Eunchae , whatever happens , I &apos;m going to fire him .
so you stay with Yoon , okay ?
mister !
psycho !
the Australian sky is beautiful .
-Our country &apos;s sky is pretty too .
Australia &apos;s is prettier .
-Then go back to Australia .
if it &apos;s that pretty , go to your country and live happily .
that &apos;s my dream .
how would it feel to be up there ?
would it be much better than here ?
would it look cooler watching it from here ?
if you &apos;re so curious , then why don &apos;t you go ?
I am going .
in just a while ...
I &apos;ll be going too .
you &apos;re finished ? I &apos;m close by , I &apos;ll be there soon .
there eating after the photo shoot .
food food !
aren &apos;t you going to eat ?
do you have money to buy a plane ticket ?
want me to buy it for you ?
Yoon is going to fire you .
it was decided that way .
I guess it &apos;s better this way .
instead of wearing yourself out about it ,
it &apos;s better to not start something that isn &apos;t meant to happen .
so ...
but from my experience ...
before we &apos;re too close and before emotions get deep ... we should just end it quick .
that way , you won &apos;t be hurt and it &apos;ll be easier to forget me .
this is the only place that &apos;s opened .
I &apos;ll buy you something nice when we go back to Seoul .
- Well , nothing we can about that .
come sit here .
excuse me !
I &apos;ll have Galbi Soup .
- I &apos;ll have Gong Soup .
our place has Soondae and Soondae soup .
would soondae please you guys ?
sure , just give those then .
then ... why ask for an order ?
I &apos;m stomach ...
I &apos;ll go to the restroom and come back
where &apos;s the restroom ?
go straight ... and then go straight again ... and from there turn around ... and go straight and there it is .
where did that lady say it is ?
- I don &apos;t know either .
how can she put her finger in the soup and serve it ? - Let &apos;s just eat it , ma &apos;am .
it &apos;s quite good .
- It &apos;s good . it &apos;s disgusting and dirty .
how can you eat this ?
what is that ?
that &apos;s cow blood , right ?
I can &apos;t eat this .
just try some .
it &apos;s really good .
I lost my appetite .
I can &apos;t eat this stuff .
these are for rustics .
you eat all of it .
let &apos;s be quiet .
quiet !
Kang Hui-sook ...
( tag reads Jung Hui-soo )
Kim Kungwoo ... you two !
Oh ... the smell ! I don &apos;t think I can do this here .
Hello ?
don &apos;t do it , Eunchae .
I &apos;m going to show everything to Yoon .
please calm down .
- I can &apos;t . you there !
you messed with the wrong person today .
your business is over , lady !
I &apos;m going to tell my son and have this place torn down and a new building built on top of it .
what the heck is she blabbing about .
let go ! let go !
Yoon !
- What happened to your face ?
that lady ... she poured that hot boiling rice soup on me .
I burned my face .
what did you do mom ?
-What do you mean what did I do ?
I only said I can &apos;t eat the food because it &apos;s not to my taste .
look at her now ... she &apos;s trying to pour that hot soup again on me .
as long as I &apos;ve lived , this is the first time I &apos;ve dealt with this .
I think I want to die , Yoon .
son !
son !
what &apos;s wrong , what &apos;s wrong ? have you gone insane ? stop !
go up first , ma &apos;am .
why ?
what about you ?
I need to stop by somewhere . -Stop by where ?
I have a friend who lives by here .
go up first .
what friend ?
what friends of yours don &apos;t I know about ?
-There is one . I &apos;ll see you in Seoul , ma &apos;am .
if they were adopted at that time these should be the babies .
can you photo copy one for me ?
excuse me ?
how may I help you ?
- I just have some questions to ask .
does a Yoon Suh-kyung reside here ?
Yoon Suh-kyung ?
-Yes , Yoon Suh-kyung .
Oh that girl .
she lived here for quite a while .. but she moved a few months ago .
moved ? -Yes . why are looking for her ?
what &apos;s the difference between Jjangoo and Octopus ?
- Jjangoo and Octopus ?
what is the difference ?
Jjangoo is ... Well , Jjangoo is .
Jjangoo can &apos;t be dried while Octopus can be .
Oh , that &apos;s true .
you didn &apos;t have to go that far .
you overreacted .
that &apos;s why we paid them for the damage .
money is not everything .
Ah , I know now ... why Eunchae stayed behind .
why ? the soup place .
she probably went to that lady .
ma &apos;am .
have a seat . I &apos;ll clean it for you .
just be seated , ma &apos;am .
turn around . a while ago it seemed you hurt your back .
I &apos;ll put a patch on it .
no , would you rather go to the hospital with me ?
I &apos;m tired .
mom , I wanna sleep .
sleep , my son .
were you alarmed ?
I &apos;m sorry for that . it was my fault .
it &apos;s ok . sing a lullaby .
Yes , ma &apos;am .
I &apos;m in front of the house .
- We will be arriving very soon .
Yoon is sleeping .
alright , see you later .
Yoon . Wakeup ! son , wake up , we &apos;re home .
have fun ?
I missed you so much I thought I was going to die .
have a good time ?
you can go home now .
you did a good job . I &apos;ll call you .
let &apos;s go in .
is he your new manager ? - Yeah .
but not after tomorrow . - That won &apos;t be necessary .
I want to keep him for now .
as you said , he might be an okay guy .
I &apos;ll try to assure Eunchae about it .
make me something good , son .
did the Seoul train leave ?
- It left .
- Yes ? where &apos;s my wife ?
-She &apos;s in there .
open up !
open up !
where is this girl ?
lady ... get out .
you ... live here ?
we &apos;ve met before , right ?
you must be the new guy that moved in downstairs .
all the better .
that day was crazy .
if it &apos;s alright with you , I &apos;d like to buy you a new dog .
what do you think you &apos;re doing ?
are you toying with me ?
but , you got the wrong person , lady .
Hey ! how do people like that exist ?
sister . why are you sleeping here ?
why the floor and not the bed ?
sleep comfortably on the bed .
I told you to sleep on the bed !
mother ...
how long do you intend to live this way ?
till death ... you want to live the rest of you life wrapped up in a small area like that ?
now you can live like a proper person ...
on a nice bed , wearing nice clothes , eating good food !

was it Yoon ?
why don &apos;t you kill me !
dry up my blood and kill me !
friend , whatever ...
you went to the soup place , right ?
I just know it .
I mean , Moohyuk caused the damage , so why did you settle things ?
do you have that much strength ?
as if ...
look at you ... looking all yellow .
I stayed up all night because of you .
you know that ?
- I do . what do you know ?
- I thought it was you .
what ?
I knew you were the one taking care of me all night .
what are you talking about ?
thank you , Yoon .
I &apos;m really really thankful .
if not for you , I ...
I would have died .
thank you for saving my life , Yoon .
Hey , why are you crying all of sudden ?
for not knowing your heart , and for getting angry at you ...
I &apos;m so sorry , Yoon .
for being mean to you ... and making you sad ...
I &apos;m so sorry .
no
I &apos;m more sorry , actually .
I was wrong , Eunchae .
I won &apos;t do that again ...
me too ... I won &apos;t do that again too .
don &apos;t touch me if you don &apos;t have any intentions to go all the way
it &apos;s been awhile , what are you doing here ?
did you eat ? I didn &apos;t see anything ok ?
I didn &apos;t want anything yet , it &apos;s good that you &apos;re here
let &apos;s go
where ?
to Yoon &apos;s
why should I go ?
I &apos;ll leave
if it &apos;s because of the scandal and it &apos;s hard for you , I &apos;ll disappear from Yoon &apos;s sight .
so stop playing around and let &apos;s go
people can &apos;t know it &apos;s you
you can breathe right ?
taxi ... taxi ... taxi ...
I &apos;m not mad at you
considering how much you put up with a player like me , how can I be mad at you ?
I don &apos;t have the right
I thought that the person you needed most was Eunchai and not me .
it &apos;s not jealousy . it &apos;s the truth
not you too !
how can you say that ?
she &apos;s like a part of my bone
Eunchai likes you Yoon .
Euchai loves you
Hey rockhead , let &apos;s play with me
Yeah , let &apos;s go
how do I know the bus number going to Maljookuri ?
I don &apos;t know !
so what am I supposed to do ?
what kind of tongue do you have ?
do you have half a tongue or something ? &#91; meaning you have no respect ?
&#93;
stop it you old geezer .
stop it !
I &apos;m going to break your cane
mister , give me that cane
I &apos;m sorry , please forgive him ...
I &apos;m so sorry
Dammit , I can &apos;t get hit on the head .
damn old geezer !
I knew this day would come . I knew you would pay the price .
you only know casual talk and have no respect
you &apos;re lucky Mister that this is the only punishment you got .
if it were me , I would have shown you no mercy . none !
thank you
I &apos;m not going to play with you
( teaching him polite expression )
I am sorry
I don &apos;t know
where are you going ?
it &apos;s very delicious
if you are not sure of the expression , just add &apos; Yo &apos; at the end of the sentence
yo ?
sleep well ( in slang )
have a nice night
what &apos;s this ?
what is this ?
you look cool
you look great
how did you learn Korean ?

how am I a guy ?
are you in your right mind ?
what are you talking about ?

I &apos;m far from here then come in 30 seconds
it &apos;s just over there .
here I &apos;ll give you a few apples
rock head !
Yoonah ...
I love you Eunchai till my muscles tremble till my bones pained .
song Eunchai
Yoonah ...
wow ... this girl &apos;s heart is actually racing !
what are you doing ?
this can &apos;t be , it can &apos;t happen
what are you talking about ?
you said you like me , you love me
who said that ? Minjoo
that stupid girl , Minjoo This can &apos;t be .
does this make sense ?
we are family , we &apos;re like siblings .
you know that we &apos;re close
wake up Eunchai ! both of us can never be man and woman , you know ?
even if you were butt naked in front of me , it wouldn &apos;t make a difference .
don &apos;t get yourself confused
just have some patience , I &apos;m going to introduce you to a great guy
it &apos;s me Hyung .
do you think that you can get something for me at dawn tomorrow ?
get some balloons and fill the trunk with it
I have a man ,
I mean a fianc ?
actually I wanted to introduce you to him .
all four of us should go out for dinner sometime
are you kidding me ?
no
then what does he do ?
he &apos;s just a salary man .
he lives in a really nice apartment in Kangnam &#91; a rich part of Seoul &#93;
he &apos;s rich , kind , handsome , and really sophisticated .
I think that he &apos;s my ideal type .
I should have told you earlier .
I &apos;m sorry for the mixup
who is it ?
that first kiss guy ...
Yoon &apos;s manager
Yeah , I left him yesterday without telling him .
he must have searched all over for me
yesterday ? sister ...
I met him yesterday and he looks like a wolf he &apos;s really someone to be sorry for
so ... what are you going to do ?
perhaps if I ask him to date again , he would say that I was crazy
like &quot; who are you playing &quot; and I &apos;ll probably get hit right ?
I couldn &apos;t sleep last night was thinking last night that no matter who I meet , I couldn &apos;t meet anyone who likes me so much .
is this because of Yoon ?
and how he &apos;s uncomfortable .
so now that you &apos;re just going to grab that &quot; dog guy ?
Moonyuk-off the streets and be with him .
I understand .
&apos;Chae Yoon is mine Kang Min Joo ?
tsk tsk ...
is it that obvious ?
when you look at me , is it that obvious that I like him when you see it ?
because you &apos;re born as a girl , there isn &apos;t one girl alive who couldn &apos;t love him .
how can you not love a cool guy like that .
but that cant be Sister , you can &apos;t be with that &apos; dog guy ?
I already kissed him and slept with him
are you living in Chosun dynasty ?
( ancient time of Korean history )
I feel sorry for him huh ?
he is shy and awkward and he can &apos;t show his best front .
who is she talking about ?
Yoon &apos;s manager .
that old wolf ! you can &apos;t !
he &apos;s mine ! I saw him first
what is the farthest place from Korea ?
the hardest place to get to ?
is there such a thing ?
he &apos;s mine !
Africa ?
missed call from Eunchai
then come to Minjoo &apos;s place ASAP Ok
it &apos;s done right ? so if Minjoo comes from here to there ...
how do I look Brother ?
Minjoo has to be touched .
she will be touched If Minjoo accepts my proposal , I will treat you nicely brother
ok Thank you , go on now
Nevermind , I &apos;ll be down in 10 minutes
where is this place ?
can &apos;t you read ?
do I look that gullible to you ?
even though I &apos;m a playgirl , I &apos;m picky for the time and partner
didn &apos;t I say before that if you don &apos; have any intention , don &apos;t touch me ?
I won &apos;t ever look for you again .
just see me , I have a room at Seoul Hotel .

SOMNAMBULISM A Collection from Uppsala University . published in 1726 .
&quot; his specialty . &quot;
the Cabinet of Dr. Caligari . in the year of 1703 , a mystic by the name of Caligari toured the fairs of numerous villages in northern Italy , accompanied by a somnambulist named Cesare ...
for month he sowed panic amongst village folks through a series of foul murders committed under almost identical circumstances .
he had entirely subjugated to his mill a somnambulist named Cesare , whom he did compel to carry out his nefarious schemes .
a puppet , the exact likeness of Cesare , and which took his place in a cabinet , allowed him to divert any suspicion that might fall on the somnambulist .
my Diary

a somnambulist has been brought to the asylum for admission ...
afternoon . my desire ...
I shall be able to satisfy my life &apos;s unwavering wish ! now I shall unravel the psychiatric secrets of this Caligari !
now I shall discover if it is true that a somnambulist can be compelled to perform acts that in a waking state he would never commit and would be repugnant to him .
whether it is true that a sleepwalker can be led to commit ... even murder !
an obsession .
&quot; I must know everything ... I must penetrate his secrets ... I must become Caligari ! &quot;
you must become Caligari .
end of Act V .

once there was a poor Salvation Army sister at death &apos;s door .
she was stricken with galloping consumption , and she had only held out for the space of a year .
when there was no hope left she had gone home to her mother .
waiting at the foot of her bed was another Salvation Army sister who had once worked alongside the sick girl .
&quot; don &apos;t fret over those poor souls now , Sister Edit . &quot;
&quot; you have done enough for them . &quot;
&quot; send for David Holm ! &quot;
&quot; please don &apos;t !
my daughter was yours as long as she had a spark of life . &quot;
&quot; let me have her to myself now that she is dying . &quot;
&quot; Slster Maria , why don &apos;t you do as I ask ?
send for David Holm ! &quot;
&quot; l shall go fetch him at once . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t be serious , asking David Holm to attend a death bed ? &quot;
&quot; l haven &apos;t been able to find him , but Gustavsson is looking too . &quot; &quot; he will bring him here if that is at all possible . &quot;
&quot; poor Mrs Holm Poor Mrs Holm &quot;
&quot; l &apos;ll take her back home . &quot;
&quot; lt wouldn &apos;t do for her husband to see her should he come . &quot;
the evening on which these events took place was not an ordinary one .
it was New Year &apos;s Eve .
&quot; well , we will certainly know when it &apos;s time to toast the New Year ! &quot;
&quot; lt &apos;s a spooky place to await midnight , here among the dead . &quot;
&quot; you gentlemen are not afraid of ghosts , I hope ? &quot;
&quot; then I &apos;d like to tell you a story while we wait for the midnight hour . &quot;
&quot; l once had a pal called Georges , who was generally a jolly fellow . &quot;
&quot; he came of a good family , and had studied hard at Uppsala University , so he knew a bit more than the rest of us . &quot;
&quot; but a change would come over him on New Year &apos;s Eve . &quot;
&quot; remember that it &apos;s New Year &apos;s Eve , the last day of the year ! &quot;
&quot; whoever dies on this eve must drive the cart of death . &quot;
&quot; there is an old , old cart ... &quot;
no ordinary driver holds the reigns . &quot; &quot; he is in the service of a strict master named Death . &quot;
&quot; for him , a single night is as long as 100 years on Earth . &quot; &quot; night and day he must carry out his master &apos;s business . &quot;
end of Part l
the Phantom Carriage Part ll
&quot; wherever he goes , he is greeted with sorrow and despair . &quot;
&quot; there is no escape He must perform his sorry duty . &quot;
&quot; although the horse and cart remain the same , the driver will vary . &quot;
&quot; the last soul to die each year , the one who gives up the ghost at the stroke of midnight , is destined to be Death &apos;s driver during the coming year . &quot;
&quot; now you know why i &apos;m afraid of something fatal happening on New Year &apos;s Eve . &quot;
&quot; and the odd thing is , you see , that Georges apparently died last New Year &apos;s Eve . &quot;
&quot; why hasn &apos;t Gustavsson arrived with David Holm ? &quot;
&quot; come with me , David Holm &quot;
&quot; sister Edit is dying and she has asked for you . &quot;
&quot; Lf Sister Edit wants to see you , you must go at once ! &quot;
&quot; David , I can &apos;t believe it &apos;s you !
you are meant to relieve me ! &quot;
&quot; you ought to lift me up ln your cart and take me to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; no living soul rides ln this cart . &quot; &quot; by the time I arrive it is too late for a doctor . &quot;
&quot; you know well enough that I am no longer alive . &quot;
&quot; but , worst of all , you must face the consequences of the evil you have wrought during your lifetime . &quot;
&quot; David , do you think i &apos;m unaware that it is my fault you have met such an end ? &quot;
&quot; Lf you hadn &apos;t fallen in with me you would have led a good life with your wife , children and brother . &quot;
&quot; by tomorrow you will have served your time for drunken behaviour . &quot;
&quot; but before you leave , a harsher punishment awaits you . &quot;
&quot; behold , your brother . &quot; &quot; while you were here he killed a man while intoxicated , and now a long prison term awaits . &quot;
&quot; but we feel that you ought to serve the sentence instead , since you and you alone led him astray , and made him a killer . &quot;
&quot; does this not make you turn from your wicked ways , David Holm ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , for only now do I realise how it feels to have brought great misery upon a loved one . &quot;
&quot; what about your wife and children ? &quot;
&quot; l know how miserable they felt , but I will turn over a new leaf . &quot;
end of Part ll
the Phantom Carriage Part lll
&quot; no , she is not ill . &quot;
&quot; she was well enough the other day , when she left . &quot;
&quot; and here I was thinking I would come home to her with such joy ! &quot;
&quot; Lf she had gone openly ,
I would have understood , but to slink off like that , to let me come home to an empty house , that was heartless ! &quot;
&quot; l &apos;ll wipe those smiles off your faces . &quot;
&quot; l &apos;ll find her , and I &apos;ll teach her how it feels when your heart freezes to its very core , like mine has ! &quot;
&quot; l &apos;ll refrain from reminding you of your search for your wife , during which your feelings of hatred and revenge waxed stronger . &quot;
&quot; l will take you to a time a year ago , to last New Year &apos;s Eve , when you came here , bringing such misfortune in your wake . &quot;
&quot; a Salvation Army station had been set up here in town . &quot; &quot; and it was ready for use on New Year &apos;s Eve . &quot;
&quot; keep your food !
I only want to sleep . &quot;
&quot; leave it be !
it may be full of germs ! &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t have the sterilising oven going yet . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t you realise , Maria , how it pleases me to help the first guest God sent us ? &quot;
&quot; please , go to bed. lt &apos;s been a busy day . &quot; &quot; let me attend to this . &quot;
&quot; dear Jesus , let our first guest be blessed with a happy year . &quot;
all night long she bent over the coat , never giving thought to the germs she had inhaled . &quot;
&quot; by the time she went to bed the chill of winter had thoroughly penetrated the room . &quot;
&quot; did you mend my coat ? &quot;
&quot; would you mind fetching the person who did this ? &quot;
&quot; lt &apos;s a shame you went to all that trouble , Miss , but i &apos;m used to having it like this . &quot;
&quot; before you leave , I &apos;d like to ask you to visit me next New Year &apos;s Eve . &quot;
&quot; you see , I prayed that our first guest would have a good year . &quot; &quot; and I wanted to find out if my prayers were answered . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I &apos;ll be here . &quot;
&quot; l &apos;ll come to show you God didn &apos;t give a fig for you or your twaddle . &quot;
&quot; the time has come to honour that promise before you take over here . &quot;
&quot; from you she contracted the disease that ends her life , and now she awaits your visit . &quot;
&quot; you have possessed all that is most wonderful , but you have lost it ! &quot;
&quot; you cannot avoid the torment or remorse , just as you cannot escape taking over as Death &apos;s driver for a year . &quot;
end of Part lll
the Phantom Carriage Part lV
&quot; lt is Death , but too soon . &quot;
&quot; you see that i &apos;m not afraid of you . &quot; &quot; l will gladly heed your summons , but grant me a day &apos;s grace , for there is someone I must talk sense into . &quot;
&quot; you do not know what terrible misfortune I have caused . &quot; &quot; l cannot approach the Lord before I have put it right . &quot;
&quot; l must tell you that the person i &apos;m waiting for is the man I love . &quot; do you understand ?
the man I love ! &quot;
&quot; l would grant you grace if it would avail you , but you have no power over this man . &quot;
&quot; you have tried to make him mend his ways , believing he was good , but your hopes have been dashed time and time again . &quot;
&quot; you &apos;re the one who enticed him away from his home and his work ! &quot;
&quot; you made him the drunkard he is ! &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t let yourself be dragged under ! &quot;
salvation Army Rally
&quot; run along and be saved , and upon my soul i &apos;ll come and watch you ! &quot;
&quot; what &apos;s the use of making such a fuss ? &quot;
&quot; l &apos;m a consumptive , but I cough into people &apos;s faces in the hope of finishing them off . &quot;
&quot; why should they be better than us ? &quot;
&quot; he &apos;s merely amusing himself . he &apos;s not as wicked as he pretends to be . &quot;
&quot; how can you be filled with such bitter hatred for your fellow man ? &quot;
&quot; you needn &apos;t worry about that . I &apos;ll be leaving town in a few days . &quot;
&quot; no , you mustn &apos;t do that ! &quot;
&quot; l would rather you stayed so I may challenge you again . &quot;
&quot; however tempting that maybe , I still can &apos;t stay . &quot;
&quot; you see , little missy , i &apos;m on a journey throughout Sweden , in search of a person I must find at all costs . &quot;
&quot; who ls this person you seek ? &quot;
&quot; you &apos;ll know that when I find the person in question &quot;
&quot; l am the one David Holm is looking for . &quot;
&quot; l am his wife . &quot;
&quot; l couldn &apos;t endure the life he led . &quot; &quot; I deserted him , took my children and crept away in secret . &quot;
&quot; l moved to this town for it was so far from our old home , that I never expected him to come looking for me here . &quot;
&quot; you must take him back !
it &apos;s his only hope ! &quot;
&quot; l didn &apos;t mean that you must make up your mind on the spot , but promise me to listen to your heart , and we can talk again . &quot;
she had got the better of herself and asked for none of the things that belonged to this world .
&quot; just come with me !
a surprise awaits that will make you happy . &quot;
end of Part lV
the Phantom Carriage Part V
she wanted to replant the seed that had fallen among the thorns , and she may well have gained her end had it not been that ...
&quot; the doctor says it &apos;s pneumonia . &quot; &quot; her resistance is so poor for she has had ill health ever since last New Year &apos;s Eve . &quot;
&quot; Yes , this David Holm has been her undoing . &quot;
&quot; she worries so about the situation between him and his wife , but she mustn &apos;t know the truth . &quot;
&quot; you might at least have the heart to spare the children from infection ! &quot;
&quot; lt wasn &apos;t as easy to run away this time ! &quot;
&quot; haven &apos;t you had enough revenge ? &quot;
&quot; Lf only I hadn &apos;t brought them together again ! &quot;
&quot; his sin would be of less magnitude if not for me . &quot;
&quot; you must grant me grace !
I cannot die yet ! &quot;
&quot; l must see him turn over a new leaf !
. just spare me a few minutes ! &quot;
&quot; you know I love him .
I &apos;ve never loved him as I do today . &quot;
&quot; captive , ye of loving heart , take leave of thy prison . &quot;
&quot; come along .
there ls nothing for us to do here . &quot; &quot; those who are to receive her will arrive shortly . &quot;
&quot; you know , David , if I could send a message to humankind , &quot; l would like to send them a New Year &apos;s greeting . &quot;
&quot; l would like them to dwell on a single New Year &apos;s prayer . &quot;
&quot; Lord , please let my soul come to maturity before it is reaped . &quot;
&quot; why are we here ?
surely no one here is going to die ! &quot;
&quot; no , I can &apos;t go on . I can &apos;t go on ! &quot;
&quot; l &apos;m sorry , but I must go away , and I cannot leave them behind . &quot;
&quot; please don &apos;t be angry with me .
it &apos;s not my fault . &quot;
&quot; this will do , David . it will suffice for the children and myself . &quot;
&quot; Yes , David , I see what &apos;s coming . &quot;
&quot; l &apos;m obliged to watch . I do not shirk my duty . &quot;
&quot; you mustn &apos;t let it happen !
Thls mustn &apos;t come to pass ! &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t let those poor , innocent creatures die ! &quot;
&quot; l have no power over the living . &quot;
&quot; where shall I turn ? &quot;
&quot; should I pray to God or to Jesus ?
who can tell me where to direct my plea ? &quot;
&quot; l &apos;m a poor , miserable sinner , I beseech thee Lord of life and Death ! &quot;
&quot; l &apos;m not worthy , I &apos;ve broken your every commandment . &quot;
&quot; sentence me to eternal night ! &quot;
&quot; let nothing remain of me ! &quot;
&quot; do what you like to me , my Lord , only spare the three of them ! &quot;
&quot; David , I see that I no longer need to grieve for you ! &quot;
&quot; she hasn &apos;t done it yet .
I made it here in time ! &quot;
&quot; sister Edit is dead , and I have been at her side . &quot; &quot; l promised her to become a good husband and father . &quot;
&quot; you &apos;re lying !
sister Maria told me you refused to go to her . &quot;
&quot; are you crying , David ? &quot;
&quot; no one believes I want to reform . &quot;
&quot; l want to be good , but no one believes me. ls it any wonder I cry ? &quot;
&quot; lt &apos;s hard to believe , David . &quot; &quot; but I do believe you . your tears convinced me . &quot;
&quot; l can &apos;t help crying too . &quot;
&quot; l won &apos;t be truly happy until my sorrow is drained . &quot;
&quot; Lord , please let my soul come to maturity before it ls reaped . &quot;

Kriemhild &apos;S REVENGE
the First Canto :
how Kriemhild Mourned Siegfried , and How König Etzel ( King Attila ) Courted Her
through Rüdiger von Bechlarn .
King Gunther , Margrave Rüdiger von Bechlarn asks for an audience !
I come as ambassador to King Attila . he who is called the Lord of the Earth -
he who seeks the hand of your sister Kriemhild in marriage .
I am afraid King Attila knows not whom he woos .
in the name of Siegfried , who was murdered and whose murderer lives !
keep in mind how Siegfried died !
Lord Attila sends me , O Queen , to ask for your hand on his behalf !
you seem to know quite well , Rüdiger , that I have been exposed to grievous wrongs in the house of my clan !
brother !
where is your brother Siegfried ?
deliver unto me the murderer of my husband , O King !
he has remained loyal to me ; so shall I remain loyal to him .
this , Kriemhild , is my final word !
lady Kriemhild , Margrave Rüdiger , wishes to speak with you after evensong !
now , Gerenot , is the time to keep close watch over Burgundy !
speak to me of Lord Attila , Rüdiger !
you court a dead woman , Rüdiger !
he who murdered my husband flaunts the greensparkling sword that he stole from the dead man .
if ever you were done wrong at Attila &apos;s court , my lady , - Lord Attila would know how to avenge you !
Lord Margrave , swear this unto me in your and in King Attila &apos;s names !
not on the cross , Lord Margrave , - on the sharp edge of your sword !
my lady !
Lord Hagen has stolen the Treasure !
you have my word , Lord Margrave Rüdiger !
Hagen Tronje , where is the Treasure ?
thus spake loyal Hagen :
somewhere , my lady , where no-one might use the gold to forge arms against the kings of Burgundy !
thus ends the First Canto .
the Second Canto :
how Kriemhild Fled Her Homeland , and How She Was Received by Lord Attila .
you have drunk Siegfried &apos;s blood , O Earth !
one day I shall drench you with Hagen Tronje &apos;s blood !
I shall return !
rest assured , I shall return !
my daughter , shall you not proffer your hand in farewell to your brother Gunther ?
no , mother .
you are heading far away , Lady Kriemhild . don &apos;t you want to make peace with your family first ?
no , my priest .
don &apos;t you even once want to hail your people , my lady ?
no , Rüdiger .
as Kriemhild approached , springtime blossomed in the land of the Huns .
that sack full of gold is mine !
the queen is coming !
meet her , brother !
royal jewellery !
my lady , King Attila &apos;s brother , Blaodel , gives thee welcome !
choose for yourself a kingdom from my lands , Rüdiger , in gratitude for this woman !
ask King Attila , Margrave Rüdiger , whether he is prepared to make your oath his own !
upon my oath , O Queen :
any man who insults you or does you wrong shall die a hundredfold death !
thus ends the Second Canto .
the Third Canto :
how King Attila Besieged Rome and How Kriemhild Summoned Her Brothers .
Lord Attila swore he wanted to turn Rome &apos;s churches into stables for our horses !
why does Lord Attila no longer uphold his oath ?
we traipsed headlong into war !
why don &apos;t we ride further onward ?
why is Lord Attila &apos;s horse tethered to his tent ?
a great horseman was King Attila !
a mighty mare for him was the world !
Lord Attila whipped the world - his mare !
what does Lord Attila do now ?
he sleeps !
he sleeps !
Lord Attila , Attila sleeps !
this white woman has stolen Attila from underneath our noses !
with her tresses does she bind up the horseman , The great horseman , Lord Attila !
this white woman has stolen Attila from underneath our noses !
with her tresses does she bind up the horseman , The great horseman , Lord Attila !
my lord - !
Kriemhild ...
my lord - !
Kriemhild has borne you a son !
O Earth ... sacred Earth ...
one wish , O Queen !
one wish that I might fulfill for you !
if you would honour me and make me happy , Lord Attila , then summon my brothers as guests to your court !
to Worms , Blaodel , to request as guests to our court the royal brothers of my wife !
thus ends the Third Canto .
the Fourth Canto :
how Kriemhild Received Her Brothers .
for more than one moon &apos;s time your brothers stayed as guests of Rüdiger in the house of Bechlarn .
the minstrels sing a new song of the love between your brother Giselher and Rüdiger &apos;s only child , the beautiful Dietlind !
and so I bind in faith -
Bechlarn and Burgundy : one heart , one life , one death !
to honour your brothers ,
Lord Attila has sent the noblest of his knights - Dietrich von Bern - to greet them .
once more , Nibelungen , before Lord Attila comes to greet you :
how could we forget , my lord , that we come to visit our sister Kriemhild ?
whoever wants to win my gratitude shall bear my sorrow in mind !
it was the day of the summer solstice , and the Nibelungen arrived at Attila &apos;s court .
King Attila , I now exhort you to your oath !
Siegfried &apos;s murderer is in your hands !
think upon my sorrow !
will you never forget Lord Siegfried , my lady ?
Hagen Tronje shall fight me for his life !
you mustn &apos;t fight with the murderer , Attila !
you must have the murderer killed !
have our guest killed ?
you swore to me , Attila !
on the life of your child : make good upon your oath !
I hail from a desert land , O Queen .
if only one thing is sacred , it is a guest !
so long as Hagen Tronje regards the peace of my house , he shall be left in peace !
she spoke :
whoever wants to win my gratitude shall bear my sorrow in mind !
whoever brings me the head of Tronje , I shall fill his shield with gold !
but I beseech you : do no harm to the sons of my mother !
play on , bard !
thus ends the Fourth Canto .
the Fifth Canto :
how the Huns Celebrated the Summer Solstice with the Nibelungen .
is it the fashion at Worms upon the Rhine to sit at table armed from head to foot ?
Lord Hagen Tronje knows why he never lays aside his sword !
Methinks that at such a feast the heir to all Attila &apos;s crowns mustn &apos;t be absent !
Methinks the boy will not live long .
scarcely shall we as guests attend any court of his !
treason !
the child !
the work of your guest , Lord Attila !
now , Nibelungen , you are fair game !
I demand safe conduct from this hall for myself and my men !
thus ends the Fifth Canto .
the Sixth Canto :
the Nibelungen &apos;s Distress .
alert Lady Kriemhild of what it is you see !
open the gate !
no Hun survives any longer in Attila &apos;s hall !
avenge thy dead , Huns !
O Queen , it is impossible !
avenge thy dead , Huns , and the royal child !
sister !
sister !
consider your mother !
hand over Siegfried &apos;s murderer - and you shall be free !
the fight is too uneven !
not one of the Nibelungen will gaze upon this next dawn .
in Giselher does my own child die !
stay out of it , Rüdiger !
blood shall follow blood !
get me Rüdiger !
the time is nigh , Lord Rüdiger !
make good upon your oath !
Lord Margrave Rüdiger , I demand from you Siegfried &apos;s murderer !
you do not send me against Hagen Tronje ,
- you send me against your brothers , my lady , who defend him with their very lives !
you &apos;ve sworn an oath , Rüdiger !
you &apos;ve sworn it upon the sharp edge of your sword !
I engaged my only child to Giselher !
blood shall follow blood , Lord Rüdiger !
my lord ! do not force me to kill my only child !
thus ends the Sixth Canto .
the Seventh Canto :
the Nibelungen &apos;s End .
Lord Rüdiger stands before the gate !
he will bring us peace !
what do you bring us , father ?
death !
my lord , do not allow they who love one another to kill one another !
tell them :
they must deliver unto me the murderer of my child - and they are free !
you know not the German soul , Lord Attila !
the oath I made to Kriemhild is older than the oath between myself and you !
don &apos;t force me to break my oath !
do you wish me to lose my honour ? !
- Defend yourself , Hagen Tronje !
O sister , what you have wrought !
deliver Hagen unto me - and you are free !
Exalt in your revenge , Kriemhild !
your younger brother is dead !
Rüdiger and his men are dead !
but Hagen Tronje lives on , who slew your Siegfried !
Hurl fire into the hall !
my lord !
the Queen bids the hall be bombarded with fire arrows !
the palace is burning !
lady Kriemhild is right , she is more than right !
I myself will stand at her side as the fire flushes the murderer Hagen from his hole !
you have my thanks , Kriemhild !
although we were never united in love , we will , in the end , yet be united in hate !
never , King Attila , was my heart so filled with love as now !
I don &apos;t want King Gunther of Burgundy to die a smoky death !
I shall offer Lady Kriemhild my head !
speak , ye Nibelungen , will you buy your lives with Hagen Tronje &apos;s head ? !
loyalty , unbroken by iron , also will not melt in fire , Hagen Tronje !
look !
Volker prepares his fiddle for one final song !
I call it a shame and a disgrace ,
lady Kriemhild , that you let these heroes whom you could not defeat in battle be annihilated in fiery distress !
do you hear ? Lord Volker is singing !
O , that we were on the cool , green Rhine !
do you hear ? Lord Volker is singing !
you are no human being , Lady Kriemhild - !
no !
I died when Siegfried died ...
an end - !
an end - !
one vassal still lives , Lord Attila !
I cannot go home to my dead Siegfried before having atoned for every wrong ...
here is the sword , Lord Hagen . where is the Treasure ?
I swore never to betray the location of the Treasure so long as one of my kings still lives !
now , Kriemhild , no-one knows anything of the Treasure other than God and myself !
and God is no more discreet than I !
now , Earth , drink your fill !
deliver her home to Siegfried , her dead husband !
she belonged to no other man !
here does the myth have an end .

Siegfried
Canto I
how Siegfried slayed the dragon
thus spoke Mime , the artful blacksmith : &quot; Siegfried , son of King Siegmund , ride home to Xanten .
even I cannot teach you any more ! &quot;
have you never before heard of the king &apos;s castle at Worms on the Rhine and the kings of Burgundy who reign there ?
I shall go there towing Kriemhild !
show me the way to Worms or you will lose your life !
farewell , Siegfried , son of king Siegmund . you will never get to Worms !
young Siegfried understood the bird &apos;s song :
if the dragon slayer would bathe in the dragon &apos;s blood , his body would become invincible , forever safe against sword and spear !
here ends the first Canto
Canto II
now Volker , the bard , sang of Siegfried in front of Kriemhild , and how Siegfried came to Worms .
the violin sounded and Volker sang :
the dragon slayer , the son of Siegmund entered the realm of the Nibelungen .
he won the fight against the dragon . there is no one on earth like him .
thus spoke Alberich , the Nibelung : spare my life and I will give you the wonder cap .
whoever wears it becomes unseen or may take whatever form he chooses !
spare my life , O hero , and I will make you the richest king on earth !
the crown of the King of the Northland , the ruler of the Ice giants is being wrought here by the Nibelungen .
no sword on earth compares with Balmung . the Nibelungen forged it in fire of blood .
all is lost . cursed be the heritage of the heir ! return with me to stone all ye whom from stone were wrought .
the violin sounded and Volker sang :
Siegfried became the dragon slayer The lord of the Nibelungen Treasure .
Twelve kingdoms subdued the powerful . Twelve kings became his vassals .
Kriemhild , the daughter of Ute : &quot; Volker , take this cloak , as reward for your song !
I embroidered it myself .
Siegfried , son of King Sigmund , is outside the castle door with twelve of his knights , and asks for an audience with King Gunther .
thus spake Hagen Tronje :
King Gunther , let the dragon slayer go his ways , don &apos;t welcome him here !
no one shall say that at Worms one does not know the way kings greet each other !
Siegfried , son of King Siegmund , has my welcome !
I dreamt last night an awful dream ...
and now this dream comes to my mind !
I come , King Gunther , to ask for your sister Kriemhild &apos;s hand .
King Gunther , too , has marriage plans . he has set his heart on a bold and mighty maiden .
her name is Brunhild and she is Queen of Iceland .
Ringed by fire , her invincible castle towers in the Northland .
why must you speak of Brunhild ? you know she has set dangerous conditions :
Thrice must the suitor best her in feats of strength or die !
Siegfried , the unique hero , has come to Worms at an opportune moment .
he may help us win Brunhild for you !
Twelve kings have I for vassals . but vassal am I to no man , now and ever !
prepare for the quest to get your bride , King Gunther . it is Siegfried the mighty hero who will win Brunhild for you .
here ends the second Canto .
Canto III :
how Siegfried won Brunhild for Gunther
the dragon ship is carrying foreign heroes to your shores !
the foreigners are nearing the flaming sea .
if he be strong enough and favored by the gods , the flames will consume themselves and die .
my maidens , help me put on my armor , this will be a fight I &apos;ve never fought before !
welcome , hero , for the fight for life or death !
neither life nor death do I desire from you , Brunhild .
it is King Gunther who woos you !
before it is evening , King Gunther , your smothered weapons will adorn my hall .
give me leave , King Gunther , to make ready your ship for Bronhild , your royal bride .
we should set sail for home before sundown !
let the triple battle begin , King Gunther !
you have to defeat me three times , king : with the stone , the spring , and the spear .
fear not , king ! make you the motions and my strength will win each contest . I &apos;ll throw the stone for you and carry you in the jump .
here ends the third Canto
Canto IV
how Brunhild enters Worms and how the kings celebrated their wedding .
start the prepartions for marriage ! the king &apos;s ship is arriving !
we have reached our destination , my queen !
are you really the man who defeated me threefold ?
I am your captive , but I shall never be your wife !
keep your word , King Gunther , as I have kept mine !
if Kriemhild gives her consent , hero , we shall celebrate a double wedding here today .
since when is it customary among Burgundians to give the King &apos;s daughter in marriage to a vassal ?
Siegfried is no vassal . I love him as though he were my brother . we shall become blood brothers today !
blood is mingling with red blood , the drops fuse inseparably .
whoever forsakes loyalty to the bloodbrother will perish at the wayside , all honor is lost !
Brunhild has been defeated , not cowed .
shall the king of Burgundy be scorned by an obstinate woman ?
Damned be the deed half done ! will you forsake your friend who gave you his own sister ?
the magic cap will change you into what you wish . take Gunther &apos;s form and break Brunhild &apos;s iron will .
here ends the fourth Canto
Canto V
how , after half a year , Siegfried &apos;s gift to his bride , the Nibelungen Treasure , arrives in Worms and how the two queens quarrel with each other .
O king , Burgundy &apos;s glory is waning , we need the Nibelungen treasure .
it would be folly to reject what Siegfried offers you as a brother and Kriemhild is worth more than all the gold in the world !
see what I found !
put away the armlet , Kriemhild , it guards an ugly secret .
the Mistress of the Nibelungen Treasure has no need for it !
listen , Kriemhild , at how I won the armlet - and keep silent !
the Nibelungen treasure has arrived !
how long , King Gunther , will Siegfried and Kriemhild tarry at the court of Burgundy ?
they stay for the sake of my mother .
would you , Brunhild , be willing to take up the daughter &apos;s place for Queen Ute ?
your brother &apos;s honor is entwined with this armlet . it never should be seen again by human eyes !
it seems to me high time , King Gunther , that you send Siegfried back home to Xanten !
never ! he shall leave of his own freewill !
I am going to attend mass , my daughter .
follow me soon !
I &apos;ll go to the cathedral in the regalia of the queen of Burgundy !
the wife of a vassal may not precede the Queen of Burgundy !
how did you dare refer to Siegfried , my husband ?
Siegfried introduced himself to me as Gunther &apos;s vassal and servant . he did servant &apos;s work for my husband !
you , whom he disdained . you , whom he gave away . you dare to belittle Siegfried ?
make way for the Queen of Burgundy , vassal woman !
you recognize this armlet , you queen of Burgundy ?
how came that armlet into your hand ?
the carrier of the magic helmet who , disguised as Gunther , defeated you three times - Siegfried , my husband gave it to me !
King ! speaks your sister the truth ?
kill Siegfried !
kill Siegfried !
your babbling , hero , was worse than murder !
kill Siegfried !
Siegfried is safe from your wrath . none can slay the dragon slayer !
save in one spot , where the linden leaf clung , is he vulnerable as other men !
King Gunther , let me deal with the dragon slayer !
we pledged blood brotherhood . how can I be party to his death ?
the one who took the armlet from me made me his wife , took my maidenhood from me !
Tronje , announce to the people of Burgundy that I invite everybody to a royal hunt to kill a mad dog and a ravening .
here ends the fifth Canto .
Canto VI
how Gunther betrayed Siegfried .
can you keep a secret Kriemhild ?
I once broke the oath to be silent and never will do so again !
well then , the upcoming hunt might easily turn into a chase for men .
a secret message warns me of war against Burgundy !
good for you , Kriemhild , that your husband is the dragon slayer , the invincible !
who warrants me that in the heat of battle not a chance blade should pierce where the lime leaf fell ?
if you want me to protect him , I have to know the exact spot where the invicible could be hurt !
you are good counsel , you truest of true .
I shall mark the spot with a little cross myself !
I come to take leave , Brunhild . we are starting for the hunt in the Odenwald forest .
mind my vow , King Gunther , I shall not eat nor drink until my disgrace has been vindicated !
O my dear lord , don &apos;t leave me . I dreamt last night a furious boar tore you to pieces !
O my dear lord , don &apos;t leave me . I dreamt further that two mountains collapsed and buried you !
today Gunther and I will reconcile . who else is my enemy ?
mother , I feel as if blood is draining from my heart !
the hunt in the Odenwald forest lasted from morning until sundown .
a handful of red gold for a cooling draught of white wine !
a wheel broke from the wagon loaded with wine . but I know of a cool brook nearby !
I always heard of you as the fastest runner of all heroes , let &apos;s run , you and I , for the first draught !
Gunther , my brother , let &apos;s be friends again !
when you are back from the spring !
grim Hagen spoke :
the hunt is over ! &quot;
here ends the sixth Canto .
Canto VII
how Kriemhild swears revenge to Hagen Tronje
you may break your fast , Brumhild , Siegfried is dead .
hail to you King Gunther ! for the sake of a woman &apos;s lie , you have slain your most loyal friend !
I call to you for justice , King Gunther ! Hagen Tronje has slain my husband !
loyalty for loyalty , Kriemhild .
his deed is ours . his fate is ours .
our breast is his shield .
you might try to hide among my clan , behind the altars of God , or at the end of the world
- You cannot escape my vengeance , Hagen Tronje !
announce to King Gunther , my brother , the Queen of Burgundy is dead !
thus ends the tale of Siegfried .

part one . &quot; men AND MAGGOTS . &quot;
the spirit of revolution soared over the Russian land .
a tremendous , mysterious process was taking place in countless hearts .
the individual personality , having hardly had time to become conscious of itself ... dissolved in the mass , and the mass itself became dissolved in the revolutionary élan .
sailors Matyushenko and Vakulinchuk .
we , the sailors of Potemkin , must support the workers , our brothers ... and stand among the front lines of the revolution !
heavy and gloomy is the sleep of the off duty .
attentive , but clumsy .
he vents his anger on a young man .
Hurtful ...
Vakulinchuk
comrades !
the time has come when we too must speak out .
why wait ?
all of Russia has risen !
are we to be the last ?
morning .
we &apos;ve had enough rotten meat !
even a dog wouldn &apos;t eat this !
the ship doctor Smirnov .
it could crawl overboard on its own !
these aren &apos;t worms .
they are dead fly larvae . you can wash them off with brine !
Russian prisoners in Japan are fed better than we are !
we &apos;ve had enough rotten meat !
it &apos;s good meat . end of discussion !
senior Officer Giliarovsky
Impotent rage was overflowing .
the ship &apos;s store .
the sailors refused to eat the borscht .
give US THIS DAY OUR DAILY BREAD
part two . &quot; drama ON THE DECK . &quot;
Commander Golikov
whoever is satisfied with the borscht take two steps forward !
the petty officers .
you &apos;re free to go !
I &apos;ll hang the rest on the yard !
call the guards !
Matyushenko , under the guise of breaking ranks , calls the sailors to the gun turret .
to the turret ...
to the turret !
to the turret ...
guys ! ...
it &apos;s time .
most of them gathered by the turret .
stop !
don &apos;t move !
they try to sneak through the admiral &apos;s hatch .
back , scoundrels !
that way is not for you !
I &apos;ll shoot you all like dogs !
cover them with canvas !
got it !
cover them !
attention !
dear Lord !
make the disobedient see reason !
fire right into the canvas !
Vakulinchuk decides .
fire !
brothers !
who are you shooting at ?
the rifles quavered .
shoot !
everyone shoot !
shoot , scum !
to the rifles , brothers !
smash the dragons !
smash &apos; em !
smash &apos; em all !
have fear of God !
beat it , sorcerer !
to the bottom to feed the worms !
brothers !
we &apos;ve won !
the bleeding Vakulinchuk flees from the furious Giliarovsky .
Vakulinchuk &apos;s overboard !
save Vakulinchuk !
and he who was first to sound the cry of rebellion was first to fall at the executioner &apos;s hand .
to the shore .
Odessa .
a tent on the new pier in Odessa is the final resting place for Vakulinchuk .
for A SPOONFUL OF BORSCHT
part three . &quot; the DEAD MAN CALLS OUT . &quot;
mist lingered on from the night ...
rumours came from the pier .
together with the sun , the news hit the city .
the battleship raided rebellion shore ...
a killed sailor ...
we &apos;ll remember .
for a spoonful of borscht .
&quot; citizens of Odessa !
lying before you is the body of the brutally killed sailor Grigory Vakulinchuk ... killed by a senior officer of the squadron battleship Prince Tavrichesky .
let &apos;s take revenge on the bloodthirsty vampires !
death to the oppressors !
signed : crew of the squadron battleship Prince Tavrichesky . &quot;
eternal memory to the fallen fighters !
all for one .
one for all .
down with the executioners !
down with tyranny !
mothers and brothers !
let there not be differences or hostility among us !
smash the Jews !
shoulder to shoulder .
the land is ours .
tomorrow is ours .
a delegate from shore .
the enemy must be dealt a decisive blow !
together with the rebelling workers from all of Russia
we WILL WIN !
the shore watched Potemkin tensely and attentively .
part four . &quot; the ODESSA STAIRCASE . &quot;
in those memorable days , the city lived together with the rebellious battleship .
like a white-winged flock , boats flew to the battleship .
and SUDDENLY
let &apos;s go !
let &apos;s convince them !
listen !
don &apos;t shoot !
my boy is badly hurt .
Cossacks !
and then the brutality of the military authorities in Odessa was answered with the battleship &apos;s shells .
the target — the Odessa theater .
the generals &apos; headquarters .
part five . &quot; rendezvous WITH THE SQUADRON . &quot;
Turbulent meetings went on until evening .
the people of Odessa are waiting for the liberators !
land the troops and the army will join you .
landing is not possible . the admiral &apos;s squadron is coming our way .
with one heart , they decided to face the squadron .
night came , full of anxiety .
the squadron was sneaking up in the darkness .
sore from constant speech , throats breathe heavily and unevenly .
squadron on the horizon !
all hands on deck !
prepare for battle !
full speed !
hearts forward !
top speed !
Potemkin and destroyer No. 267 .
the admiral attacks !
the squadron draws near !
give the signal : join us !
join !
... ... us !
the enemy is within firing range !
all against one .
one AGAINST ALL .
... or ...
brothers !
above the heads of the tsar &apos;s admirals thundered a brotherly hurrah .
and proudly waving the red flag of victory , without a single shot , the rebellious battleship passed through the rows of the squadron .

there were two loves in his live .
his engine , And--
&quot; fort Sumter has been fired upon . &quot;
&quot; then the war is here . &quot;
&quot; Yes , dad , and I &apos;m going to be one of the first to enlist . &quot;
&quot; aren &apos;t you going to enlist ? &quot;
&quot; your name ? &quot;
&quot; Johnnie Gray . &quot;
&quot; occupation ? &quot;
&quot; engineer on the Western and Atlantic Railroad . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t enlist him .
he is more valuable to the South as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; we can &apos;t use you . &quot;
&quot; William Brown . &quot;
&quot; occupation ? &quot;
&quot; bartender . &quot;
&quot; if you lose this war don &apos;t blame me . &quot;
&quot; did Johnnie enlist ? &quot;
&quot; he didn &apos;t even get in line . &quot;
&quot; he &apos;s a disgrace to the South .
&quot; why didn &apos;t you enlist ? &quot;
&quot; they wouldn &apos;t take me . &quot;
&quot; please don &apos;t lie .
I don &apos;t want you to speak to me again until you are in uniform .
a year later .
in a Union encampment just North of Chattanooga .
General Thatcher , and his chief spy , Captain Anderson .
&quot; I Know every foot of this railroad from Marietta to Chattanooga , and with ten picked men I cannot fail . &quot;
&quot; we will enter the South as civilians coming from the neutral state of Kentucky to join the southern cause . &quot;
&quot; at Big Shanty we will steal the train while the passengers and the crew are at dinner , and proceeding North we will burn every bridge , cutting off the supplies of the army now facing you . &quot;
&quot; then the day you steal the train I will have General Parker advance to meet you . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I arrive I will let you know how seriously father is wounded . &quot;
&quot; big Shanty . Twenty minutes for dinner . &quot;
&quot; three men stole my General .
I think they are deserters . &quot;
&quot; why not stop and fight them ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m afraid they have us greatly outnumbered . &quot;
the Southern army facing Chattanooga is ordered to retreat . &quot;
General Parker &apos;s victorious Northern army advancing .
in the enemy &apos;s country , hopelessly lost , helplessly cold and horribly hungry .
&quot; at Nine o &apos;clock tomorrow morning our supply trains will meet and unite with General Parker &apos;s army at the Rock River bridge . &quot;
&quot; then the army , backed by our supply trains , will advance for a surprise attack on the rebels left flank . &quot;
&quot; once our trains and troops cross that bridge , nothing on the earth can stop us . &quot;
&quot; this girl was in the baggage car when we stole the train , so I thought it best to hold her . &quot;
&quot; we had better stay here until daybreak to see where we are . &quot;
&quot; it was so brave of you to risk your life , coming into the enemy &apos;s country , just to save me . &quot;
after a nice , quiet , refreshing night &apos;s rest .
&quot; we &apos;ve got to get back to our lines somehow and warn them of this coming attack . &quot;
&quot; I will get that spy before he reaches the Southern lines .
you follow with the supply trains as planned . &quot;
&quot; we must pick up more firewood . &quot;
the Rock River bridge .
the Northern division nearing the bridge to meet the supply trains .
&quot; that bridge is not burned enough to stop you , and my men will ford the river . &quot;
heroes of the day .
&quot; is that your uniform ? &quot;
&quot; I had to wear it to get through the lines . &quot;
&quot; take it off ! &quot;
&quot; enlist the lieutenant . &quot;
&quot; occupation ? &quot;
&quot; soldier . &quot;

&quot; he &apos;s a sensation , but he doesn &apos;t know it . &quot; &quot; keep him on as a property man . &quot;
the Circus prospered , but not the property man . and the girl led the same hard life .
&quot; keep him busy and don &apos;t let him know he &apos;s the hit of the show . &quot;
a Sick Horse .

&quot; why of course ! &quot; &quot; all the crowds , all the applause is just for you . &quot;
&quot; I knew it ! &quot;
&quot; if you strike that girl , I &apos;ll quit ! &quot;
&quot; and what &apos;s more I want what I &apos;m worth -- &quot;

it &apos;s for her own good , Kitty . honest .

grow up at a nice place . not in some lousy burlesque theater .
no sleeper jumps and none of the small town johns hanging around at nights .
and there &apos;ll be sisters there to teach her the word of God .
and she &apos;d grow up in a nice place , grow up to be a lady .
not a cheap little tot . you want April to be a lady , don &apos;t you ?
you bet she &apos;s gonna be a lady . I got plans for her .
then you &apos;d better send her to that convent .
maybe I will . maybe I will .
let us contemplate in its mystery how our Lord , Jesus Christ being sentenced to die bore with great patience the cross which was laid upon him for his greater torment and ignominy .
and now , April , there &apos;s a little prayer that goes with this , dear .
it goes like this .
Oh , Holy Virgin , example of patience .
by the most painful carrying of the cross on which thy son , our Lord Jesus Christ , bore the heavy weight of our sins , obtain for us of Him , by thy intersession , courage and strength to follow His steps
and bear our cross after Him to the end of our lives ,
amen .
I know he loves me , heaven knows why
and when he tells me he can &apos;t live without me what wouldn &apos;t I do for that man ?
he &apos;s not an angel or saint ,
I know he loves me , heaven knows why and when he tells me he can &apos;t live without me what wouldn &apos;t I do for that man ?
I &apos;ll never leave him alone , I &apos;ll make his troubles my own
with all his faults I know we &apos;ll get by
I &apos;m just no good when his arms are about me what wouldn &apos;t I do for that man ?
what wouldn &apos;t I do for that man ?
give me air .
after that one I &apos;d better get out of here while I &apos;m still alive .
come on , Hitch , stick around .
it &apos;s early .
I can &apos;t , Peggy . honest .
Kitty &apos;ll be sore .
anybody &apos;d think she got a mortgage on you .
you see that rock ?
as long as she keeps kicking in with little love tokens like that , sweetness ,
I &apos;m gonna keep right on being her wide-bedded boy .
okay , big boy .
as long as she doesn &apos;t get wise that you &apos;re giving the runaround with every dame in the coop .
when she does , I &apos;ll get me a new mama , peaches .
and your name &apos;s right on top of the list .
Aw , baloney .
I loved that man from the start and way down deep in my heart
I know he loves me , heaven knows why and when he tells me he can &apos;t live without me
what wouldn &apos;t I do ...
Hello , beautiful !
gee , you gave me a start .
ain &apos;t you home early ?
well , I dumped the gang , luscious .
had to come home to my big blonde mama .
Oh , honey . my own sweet boy .
what &apos;s all that stuff ? forget-me-nots ?
just a lot of old letters and junk .
Hey , what john wrote your loads ?
you ain &apos;t the first good-looking guy in my life .
but the last , eh ?
who &apos;s the dame ?
give me that .
wait a minute , can &apos;t you ?
what &apos;s the rush ?
cute kid .
sister ?
to my own darling mama .
give me that .
Hey !
what &apos;s that mean &quot; To my own darling mama &quot; , eh ?
you can read , can &apos;t you ?
you mean to tell me this kid &apos;s yours ?
well , is it ?
well , what if she is ?
you &apos;ve been holding out on me .
shut up .
you &apos;re all alike .
just a lot of dirty double-crossing broads .
how old is the kid ?
seventeen .
where &apos;s she at ?
in school .
in a convent .
that &apos;s a laugh .
what for ?
I got plans for her .
I want her to have an education .
Yeah , but I always thought those joints were so expensive .
I manage to round up a coin every month .
so that &apos;s where all your spare cash goes .
no wonder you didn &apos;t have 100 bucks to loan me Monday .
but when I do have it to loan , what do you do with it ?
drop it in some bookie &apos;s lap .
well , I &apos;m not thinking of myself so much now , see ?
but you oughta be sore if I go away .
sure , you got a great career .
but it takes plenty of jack as well as talent to make the grade .
I got plenty of both , I guess .
speaking of that , how about that act of ours you said the Keith Office was interested in ?
there you are , you see ?
that &apos;s gonna cost about $ 1200 to mount .
Classy looking props , three changes for you , orchestrations and I &apos;ll bet you ain &apos;t got $ 1200 .
maybe not .
but you said you &apos;d help , remember ?
now , that ring I gave you .
I knew that was coming .
hawk it , eh ?
that &apos;s all the sentiment you got in ya .
hawk that new overcoat you got me too , I suppose .
no , I want you to look nice .
Yeah , well ...
I guess I &apos;m gonna be the little old excess baggage around here from now on .
I can see you &apos;ve been playing me for a sucker .
just a goodtime pal to keep you from getting lonesome on sleeper-jumps .
I &apos;ve been nuts about you . but I &apos;m wise now .
Hitch , what are you driving at ?
I guess I got sense enough to know when I &apos;m through .
you &apos;re not walking out on me ?
what do you expect me to do after the deal you &apos;ve given me ?
what deal , honey , what are you talking about ?
when we made our bargain it was gonna be 50 / 50 and no holding out on each other , right ?
now what ?
I find out you got a kid seventeen and you &apos;ve been blowing your dough up .
dough we need for ourselves , for our future , for your career .
what can I do , she &apos;s my daughter , ain &apos;t she ?
I &apos;ll tell you what you can do .
you don &apos;t have to keep her in some expensive dump like that , do you ?
now get the kid down here .
take her out of school ?
make her go to work .
she &apos;s old enough .
I wanna keep my baby out of show business .
okay , Kitty , that &apos;s my answer .
wait a second . give me time to think .
there ain &apos;t nothing to think about .
it &apos;s her or me . that &apos;s flat .
all right , if you think that &apos;s the right thing to do .
why , sure it is , babes .
it &apos;s time you did something for yourself instead of dishing out the gravy for someone else like you do .
one thing no , Hitch . she ain &apos;t going in to show business .
I &apos;ll get her a job outside some place .
okay , Kitty , just so long as she holds up our own name .
now you sit right down here and write her a little letter .
now , Hitch , don &apos;t be cross at me , but don &apos;t you think we oughta think this over a little ?
honest , the way you rush me into things sometimes ...
will you just stop fussing and write to her ?
you &apos;ve been saving and scrimping all your life to keep this jane in school .
now it &apos;s her turn to do something for you .
help you put away a little money for a rainy day , right ?
Oh , I don &apos;t know ...
you got a great career , babes .
she oughta be proud to help you , proud to be Kitty Darling &apos;s daughter , right ?
why , I know so . she ain &apos;t as good looking as her ma ... maybe she takes after her old man .
instead you can depend on me , Kitty baby , to treat her right for your sake .
why , we &apos;ll just be one big happy family .
one big happy family .
may God &apos;s love and kindness guide you .
as you go forth into the great world outside these gates ... and keep you from all harm till we meet again .
that is my prayer for you .
little angel .
Goodbye .
looking for somebody , honey ?
Yes , I ...
Mr. Greeley .
Mr. Greeley .
cash customer .
I &apos;m supposed to meet my mother here , Miss Darling .
Oh , so you &apos;re Kitty Darling &apos;s little girl , eh ?
well , I &apos;m a couple of cockeyed sewing sewers .
my name &apos;s Eddy Vermont .
I &apos;m in the merry-merry too .
one of your momma &apos;s best pals .
put it back here .
how do you do , Mr. Vermont ?
your ma is up at the theater .
she wants you to wait upstairs till she gets back .
Oh , how long will I have to wait to see her ?
not more than an hour or so .
these uptown grind joints get out early .
I &apos;ll show you to the rooms .
thank you .
you got a great ma , Miss Darling .
and believe me , she sure knows her stuff .
that Swedish movement of hers has been laying &apos;em in the aisles ever since I was a pup .
Swedish movement ?
I mean the way Kitty slams over her number .
and boy , she packs the meanest strip and teaser routine that ever burned a Verona way .
you know what I mean .
not exactly .
I haven &apos;t seen my mother on the stage since I was five .
no ?
but I remember she was wonderful .
I &apos;ll say so .
say , I got a bright idea .
instead of hanging around this dump , why don &apos;t you grab the Lexington Ave. local and go up and catch the show ?
do you really think I could ?
sure .
I can &apos;t take you myself , I have a heavy date .
but my kid brother , Slim , he &apos;ll take you .
he &apos;s a nice guy , too .
okay with you ?
Yes .
all right , I &apos;ll get him right down .
512 , sweetheart .
slim ?
come right down .
I got a job for you .
Yeah , yeah .
sorry the seats ain &apos;t so hot but the show &apos;s almost over .
sit down !
what are you looking at , punk ?
we oughta pension off that faded old blonde .
Yeah , she &apos;s all worked up anyway , look at that .
let &apos;s go away from here , please .
okay , I &apos;ll take you back to your ma .
all right .
all right , tag along this side .
mommy !
April , baby !
I don &apos;t know whether I done right bringing her up here , Kitty .
but she was all harped up in seeing you .
we thought it would be a nice surprise .
it sure was , you did just right .
Oh , my , look at this girl ...
well , guess I &apos;ll be edging along .
so long everybody .
Bye .
you look like an old lady .
Oh , mother , mommy !
Oh , dear . you &apos;re so pretty . ain &apos;t she , Hitch ?
Yes .
Oh , this is Hitch Nelson .
he &apos;s the Hitch I &apos;ve been writing you about .
how do you do , Mr. Nelson ?
make it Hitch , kid .
we &apos;re all pals together .
what do you think of my great big girl .
a litttle skinny .
Ah , Hitchy . ain &apos;t he a lemon , though ?
honest , the things he says to people I meet .
he &apos;s a bad one . he don &apos;t mean nothing by it .
now you sit down here .
say , you better finish your change , beautiful .
you only got a couple of minutes .
Yeah , that &apos;s right .
if I had known I could have company like this I ... oooh !
like this , well ...
angel baby , just as soon as we get out of this joint we &apos;ll go down to Gialetta &apos;s and we &apos;ll sit on the swellest place you ever saw and stuff ourselves flat in the face .
up short , Kitty .
all right , all right .
come on , watch me finish the show .
I &apos;d rather stay here if you don &apos;t mind .
all right for you then .
kick &apos;er up , honey .
got any ideas about going into show business ?
no .
why not ?
don &apos;t you like it ?
you &apos;re a funny kid .
Oh , don &apos;t jump . I ain &apos;t gonna bite .
did you hear that ?
suppose that was for you , huh ?
everybody in the whole damn house clapping and yelling .
going nuts about ya .
nice ?
no ?
why not ?
you &apos;re a funny kid .
just a little bit goofy .
but that &apos;s what comes from not knowing what it &apos;s all about .
please , Mr. Nelson .
didn &apos;t I ask you to call me Hitch ?
I wanna be your pal , see ?
and if you listen to me you &apos;ll let me learn you a couple of dance routines to put you in the show .
no , thank you .
I &apos;m pretty sure I don &apos;t want to be in the show .
but you &apos;ve got the makings of a great artist .
with your looks and my training it &apos;s Broadway for you , no foolin &apos; .
that &apos;s the finale .
gotta go . Seeya later , kid .
... and give your baby nights a lovin &apos; ...
open up your eyes and open up your lips
why don &apos;t you try to get some sleep , precious ?
I can &apos;t .
you oughta be plenty tired after your trip and all .
Oh , I &apos;m tired enough but ...
I don &apos;t know .
I feel funny .
all mixed up inside .
why , precious .
what &apos;s the matter ?
tell mother what &apos;s the matter .
everything is so different from what I thought it would be .
sure . you ain &apos;t in a convent anymore .
but ain &apos;t you glad to be back with me again ?
Yes , mommy darling , but ...
I don &apos;t know how to describe it .
but New York &apos;s too big , dirty and noisy .
and your theater with all those men ... and the girls with no clothes on .
Oh , I suppose it does seem queer to you .
coming from a place where they cover everything but their noses .
but things ain &apos;t as bad as that .
it ain &apos;t what you do so much . it &apos;s what you are .
that &apos;s it .
it &apos;s what you are .
why there &apos;s a couple of dames in this troupe good at things you &apos;d never expect to see , even if they do make their living shaking .
I ain &apos;t ashamed of it . you shouldn &apos;t be ashamed of me neither .
Oh , mommy , I &apos;m not ashamed of you .
let me tell you something , April , baby .
if it wasn &apos;t for the dough I &apos;ve been piling up that way in the last 10 or 12 years you would never have been to no convent .
I know . I know .
that &apos;s what I &apos;ve been thinking .
I &apos;m just beginning to realize that .
all these things you &apos;ve gone through and I never knew .
dancing with those girls . horrible men staring at you .
saying awful things .
now don &apos;t you think I &apos;m going to be in this burlesque racket all my life neither .
just one more season with my name on Broadway in lights .
and the big dough . then we &apos;ll have a nice little home .
and we &apos;ll be together and be happy .
Oh , mommy .
you &apos;ve done so much to make me happy .
from now on I &apos;ll try and make you just as happy .
Oh , I ain &apos;t done nothing .
but we &apos;ve got each other from now on and it &apos;s gonna be for always .
Yes , for always .
and we &apos;ll be so happy together .
just you and I .
you said it .
after all , snooks , things can &apos;t be all bad as long as we got each other .
don &apos;t you forget that .
now you go to sleep , now .
close your pretty eyes and close your pretty lips and give your baby nights a loving ...
mommy , about Mr. Nelson
what about him ?
I don &apos;t think he likes me .
Aw , he &apos;s crazy about you .
why , he said so .
are you going to be married ?
really ?
I don &apos;t know ?
I don &apos;t know .
but don &apos;t you worry about it , now .
go to sleep , baby .
go to sleep .
close your pretty eyes and close your pretty lips
Oh , Holy Virgin ... by the pain ...
in which our Lord Jesus Christ ...
bore the burden of our sins ... obtain for us by thy intecession the courage and strength
follow in his footsteps and bear our cross until the end of our lives .
amen .
what do you want ?
you &apos;ll wake her up .
get us a drink .
Oh , mommy . mommy , the telephone .
all right , baby .
did you have a good sleep , angel ?
Yes , thank you .
Hello .
Oh , hello , Gus . good morning yourself .
Oh , is that all ?
ok , we &apos;ll meet the troupe at the station at three .
that was Gus Weinbaum from the booking office .
we open in Buffalo this week .
better get up and get dressed , precious .
we gotta start packing .
got a nice cold grapefruit for you and a swell breakfast .
Oh , good .
we open in Buffalo tomorrow .
now Hitch , honey ...
let &apos;s settle our problems .
you and me , we can &apos;t go on like we have with April here .
we gotta get married now .
well , it &apos;s up to you , Kitty .
it &apos;s okay with me like I told ya , providing that kid of yours is put to work .
she will , honey , she is going to work , but not in show business .
I got other plans for her .
there you go again .
what else can she do , I &apos;m asking ya ?
I mean , here we are , jumping to Buffalo with that ... and from there , well , who knows ?
now if she gets a job in New York that means she can &apos;t travel with us .
so , are you planning on leaving her alone here ?
the kid &apos;s got a real chance in burlesque . don &apos;t you see that ?
she &apos;s got youth , looks , the whole works .
she comes by it naturally .
I can make her one of the biggest bets in show business .
but she don &apos;t wanna be in show business . she said she hates it .
how does a kid like that know what she wants ?
now listen , Kitty . I &apos;m not gonna waste any more time arguing .
I &apos;m not gonna get married unless I &apos;m gonna be the boss .
and if I &apos;m gonna be the boss , I say the kid is going into show .
that &apos;s final .
I don &apos;t know .
don &apos;t be cross at me , Hitch .
I &apos;m trying to do the best all around . if you think it &apos;s the right thing to do ...
why , sure it is , babes .
you go on in there and get her . I &apos;ll talk to her .
I &apos;ll sell her the idea . she &apos;s getting the swellest break a kid ever got .
we &apos;ll be one big happy family , huh ?
the three of us .
we &apos;ll go to Buffalo or any other man &apos;s place , huh ?
come on , get her in here . April !
April , baby . come here .
mommy wants to talk to you .
come here , baby . come to your daddy .
he &apos;s gonna pour a million dollars in gold in your lap .
here &apos;s to the bride and groom .
how &apos;s that ?
rotten .
now look , now .
don &apos;t !
what &apos;s the matter ?
I don &apos;t like to be mauled Too bad about you .
maybe a good maui would do you good for a change .
this touch-me-not stuff is beginning to give me a pain in the neck .
what &apos;s the idea of that ?
it &apos;s too hot in here .
Yeah ?
come on , let &apos;s run through that tap routine .
what &apos;s the matter with you ?
you &apos;ve been in the show eight months and you got about as much ambition as a Ziegfeld clothes horse .
can &apos;t you take a little interest in what I &apos;m trying to teach you ?
no . I hate dance .
and I hate burlesque .
you don &apos;t have to stay in burlesque .
just give me a little cooperation I &apos;ll make another Marilyn Miller out of you .
I &apos;m not interested .
will you lay off that tone of voice ?
here I am . trying to help you , trying to be your pal .
you treat me like I was an ashman or something .
Jeez , you get my goat !
why don &apos;t to let me alone .
let you alone ?
listen , what you need is to have somebody wake you up and make you be human .
I got a good mind to teach you a couple of tricks they &apos;d never learn you in a convent .
you won &apos;t teach me anything .
let go of my wrist .
I met babies like you before , Saint Cecilia .
there &apos;s only one way to treat them and that &apos;s rough .
there , that &apos;s something to think about .
Oh , oh !
what &apos;s going on here ?
it &apos;s just that precious infant of yours getting temperamental again .
don &apos;t you two ever stop fighting ?
here I am , working like a dog trying to learn her the business .
never mind .
what do you think that dirty little Gus Weinbaum pulled on me this morning ?
he said he ain &apos;t gonna give me a contract for the new stock season ... till I &apos;ve been in the show for two weeks and he can see how I get by .
not only that , he practically insists that I go with a bunch of the girls ... to a lousy stag smoker in the Bronx after the show tonight .
can you beat that for a nerve ?
me , Kitty Darling , dancing for a lot of drunk stags .
well , what of it ?
the problem with you and that kid of yours is you &apos;re both getting too high-hat .
why , Hitchy .
what &apos;s the matter with you , cookie ?
Oh , nothing .
you hadn &apos;t oughta be fighting all the time .
I &apos;d like you &apos;d to try to be nice to him for a change .
try to make him love you , cookie .
make him love me ?
Yes , angel . make him love you .
for my sake .
this is a swell night to be going to a stag smoker .
thought you were going to try to get me out of it .
well , I argued with Gus but it didn &apos;t do no good .
a good husband you are , letting Gus send your wife to shake for a mob Bronx gorillas .
on such a hot night .
well , fifty bucks is fifty bucks .
ready to go home , mommy ?
no , sweetness , I gotta go to that stag smoker .
Hitch couldn &apos;t fix it for me with Gus .
I &apos;ll see that you get home okay , April .
I gotta get going .
come on , snooks , walk out to the door with me .
you wait outside for me , April .
she will .
mommy , take me with you , please .
to a stag party ? I should say not .
I &apos;ll wait outside for you .
till 3 or 4 o &apos;clock in the morning ?
you &apos;re crazy .
now you go back to the hotel .
I don &apos;t want to go back to the hotel with Hitch .
please , mommy , please .
the girls in the taxi are waiting for you , Miss Darling .
thanks , Otto . now you stop fussing about Hitch .
be a good girl .
maybe he &apos;ll buy you some chop suey .
I gotta tip him .
mommy !
Oh , hey , I &apos;ve been waiting for you .
oops ! Hello , kid . Hey give us a kiss .
what &apos;s your hurry , sister ?
where are you going , baby ?
wait a minute , sweetheart . come on , baby , give me a break .
say , listen now , just ...
say , who do you think you &apos;re messing with ?
stay away !
Hey , what &apos;s this ?
keep out of this .
she &apos;s my girl .
I am not .
he &apos;s following me .
on your way , guy , or I &apos;ll poke a hole through that pant of yours .
you and Harmony Marines .
you Navy guys think you &apos;re tough , don &apos;t ya ?
they don &apos;t come any tougher .
got any other odd jobs for the Navy tonight ?
no , thank you so much .
pretty late for a little girl like you to be wandering around by yourself .
maybe I &apos;ll have to stroll a little way with you .
Oh , please don &apos;t bother .
did you say &quot; bother &quot; ?
hope you don &apos;t think I &apos;m fresh walking along with you like this .
not at all .
I hope you don &apos;t think I &apos;m trying to follow you or anything .
Oh , no .
live around here ?
no .
I come all the way from Wisconsin .
why don &apos;t you go back ?
say , I think you &apos;re trying to get rid of me .
how did you guess ?
Oh , I &apos;m clever that way .
what way ?
Oh , come on , be nice , won &apos;t you ?
I &apos;m not a gorilla .
but I don &apos;t know you .
well , use your chance . no , listen , here &apos;s the idea .
why not let &apos;s stop somewhere and get something to eat ?
there &apos;s no harm in that .
and if you don &apos;t like the cut of my gib I &apos;ll be on my way .
well , that seems fair enough .
I always eat after the show anyway .
now you &apos;re talking .
say , you &apos;re nice . you don &apos;t look like a show girl .
maybe I shouldn &apos;t have mentioned it .
no kidding , I like you .
and I guess you &apos;re not so bad yourself .
come on , Wisconsin .
boy , was I hungry .
me too .
gee , you don &apos;t know how much I appreciate this .
I mean , I &apos;ve been cruising around town all evening ... up one street and down the other .
just looking for somebody to talk to .
sailors don &apos;t generally have much trouble finding company .
Oh , I don &apos;t want the kind of company you mean .
listen , all sailors ain &apos;t a bunch of bums .
but you got no idea how tough it is to be all alone and lonesome in a city like this .
maybe I have .
Aw , a girl like you lonesome .
so , what &apos;s your name , anyway ?
I &apos;ve been so excited about finding you I forgot to ask .
April . April ?
no kidding ?
sounds like a name out of a book .
I don &apos;t know , though . it sorta fits you .
sounds sweet , sort of gentle . just like I bet you are .
Oh , you say the same thing to every girl you meet .
how could I ?
I never met a girl named April before .
what &apos;s your name ? Tony .
I don &apos;t like it much . sounds like a white bootblack .
Oh , no , I think Tony &apos;s a nice name .
you do ?
Tony and April .
sounds nice together , eh ?
gee , but your eyes are blue .
eat your chocolate cake .
April .
April .
April .
why the little ...
Hello , Ed ?
did April come in yet ?
she didn &apos;t ?
are you sure ?
thanks .
the little ...
those big waves ...
gosh , they look to be about as tall as the Woolworth building , pretty near .
they &apos;d come down over the bough , crash .
and the ship would shake like it was gonna split in two .
one big wave after the other .
boy , all night we didn &apos;t know if we was gonna weather it or not .
well , anyway ... next morning the sun was shining the ocean was as smooth as glass .
and right up the starboard was the coast of China .
it must be wonderful to sail all over the world that way .
Oh , I don &apos;t know . you get tired of it just like anything else .
I got a week to make up my mind if I &apos;m gonna enlist again .
I suppose I will .
sorry , pal . closing time .
but the park is still open .
okay , skipper .
I had no idea it was so late .
here you are .
gee , I don &apos;t want to lose you so soon .
just when we were getting acquainted .
can &apos;t we find some other place ?
but it &apos;s pretty late .
I know just the place . it &apos;s nice and cool too .
where ?
Brooklyn Bridge .
isn &apos;t it beautiful ?
Yeah . sure is pretty .
even Brooklyn looks pretty .
it must be awfully late .
what do you care ?
my mother will be worried .
I do have to sleep some time .
they have rehearsal at eleven .
well , I won &apos;t get much sleep tonight .
it &apos;s too hot to sleep .
I mean , I &apos;ll be thinking about you .
look at that city over there .
everybody sleeping .
everybody dreaming .
and two people like us , on this bridge just as if we &apos;ve known each other all our lives .
it &apos;s sort of like a dream too , isn &apos;t it ?
Yeah .
pretty soon the sun will come up and the people will wake up .
and even you and I will go right on the way we were before .
just as if we &apos;d never met at all .
say , don &apos;t kid yourself .
I &apos;m gonna camp right on your doorstep the rest of the time I &apos;m on leave .
how long is that ?
Saturday . this is Tuesday .
that makes four days .
and then you &apos;ll forget all about me .
no , sir .
never .
Yes , you will .
you &apos;ll go sailing away from me , just like that boat down there will now .
a tanker going out with the tide .
ships have to go out with the tide , don &apos;t they ?
and sailors have to go with their ships .
and the world is full of other rivers and bridges with girls to sit on them till the tide goes out .
Oh , April , I &apos;m not like the rest of those gobs .
sometimes I think there are people who were just meant to be lonesome .
you know , and then they &apos;ll meet someone for a little while and it gives them something to remember .
so their lonesomeness doesn &apos;t hurt so much for a while .
I don &apos;t know how to say what I mean .
Yes , but if those people meet the right people they get together for keeps .
then they ain &apos;t lonesome anymore .
but the right people don &apos;t seem to find each other very often .
Yeah , ain &apos;t it the truth .
well , Tony ...
well ...
I &apos;ve got to go home .
I don &apos;t want to , but I &apos;ve got to .
right .
let me help you down .
good night .
or rather , good morning .
don &apos;t forget tomorrow .
it &apos;s a date .
I won &apos;t .
I hope I &apos;m gonna live that long .
just don &apos;t stop breathing .
looks like I just can &apos;t let you go .
I &apos;ve really got to go now .
well ...
well ...
good night .
good night .
good night , girls .
go right home , now . leave that taxi driver alone .
Hello , sailor boy .
Hello , yourself .

well , young lady , where do you think you &apos;ve been ?
is mommy in yet ? never mind .
who &apos;ve you been out with until 5 o &apos;clock in the morning ?
none of your business .
a pickup , huh ?
a pickup just like every other cheap little burlesque dame .
I &apos;m not a cheap little burlesque dame .
just an innocent kid from a convent , huh ?
well get this through your head .
if you &apos;re gonna start this stay-out-all-night stuff I &apos;m gonna have something to say about it myself .
charity begins at home , baby .
let me go !
let me go ...
well , what &apos;s this ?
Hello , beautiful .
you &apos;re just in time to witness the signing of the Peace Treaty .
while we was waiting for you we come to an understanding .
everything &apos;s jake now .
April April , is it true ?
just one big happy family from now on .
everything &apos;s swell okay .
one big happy family , hooray !
oooh , gee wiz , I gotta lie down ,
gee .
look at all those people down there .
aren &apos;t there a lot of people in the word , though ?
only two as far as I &apos;m concerned .
look .
just look .
I &apos;d hate to fall .
if you did , I &apos;d fall right after you .
wouldn &apos;t that be silly ?
look , the Woolworth Building .
Yeah .
that &apos;s some sight , isn &apos;t it ?
Oh , it &apos;s wonderful .
you are wonderful .
well , there &apos;s the sea .
Yes .
look at the old Statue of Liberty .
I bet if I stood here I could see your ship when it leaves tonight .
I should wave my handkerchief .
what are you laughing at ?
well , April , I &apos;m not going back to my ship .
why not ?
well , I got an important date tomorrow .
have you ?
Hm-hm .
and so have you .
we &apos;re gonna be married .
Oh , I thought for a minute you were serious .
I am .
you &apos;re gonna marry me ... and we &apos;re going back to my home town in Wisconsin and graze wheat and have a Ford , a radio , well , and several things .
we are not .
Oh , yes we are .
you &apos;re gonna marry me .
it &apos;s all decided .
I decided it .
did you ?
you better say yes .
I don &apos;t see why .
because if you don &apos;t , I &apos;ll jump right off this roof .
Oh , Tony !
Yes !
Aw , gee , I &apos;m happy .
aren &apos;t you ?
Yes .
what I know about sailors , they
but I believe everything you told me about yourself and your folks .
I think you &apos;re on the level .
you bet I &apos;m on the level , Miss Darling .
you gotta be good to my little girl .
she &apos;s just a baby .
don &apos;t worry about that .
she &apos;ll love it out in the country .
my folks will be crazy about her .
well , that &apos;s that , I suppose .
I &apos;m glad .
I never wanted April to be in show business .
my baby angel .
what &apos;s the next thing on the program ?
why , I thought we all might all have dinner some place to celebrate .
where ?
you gotta make it early .
I have a show .
how about that chop suey place we was at the other night ?
that &apos;s fine .
okay , about six ?
great .
well , I &apos;ll be running along .
Goodbye for a little while , sweetheart .
Oh , excuse me .
you &apos;re all right , son .
was that the boyfreind we &apos;ve been hearing so much about I &apos;ve just run across in the hall ?
mommy , I &apos;ll go in and change my dress .
wait a minute , I &apos;m talking to you .
this playing around with the Navy &apos;s gotta stop .
Oh , let her alone .
she &apos;s got a date with her fiancée .
her what ?
the man she &apos;s gonna marry .
are you trying to kid me ?
no , April &apos;s gonna be married .
you &apos;re telling me you &apos;re gonna allow April to marry some lousy gob ?
Oh , he &apos;s all right .
I like him .
we had a long talk .
you had a long talk .
well , how about consulting me once in a while ?
Oh , turn your dapper down .
everything &apos;s under control .
Oh , it is , is it ?
that &apos;s what you say .
now me just back from a two-hour session at the Keith Office getting our acts set .
what &apos;s that got to do with April ?
everything .
they want her to do it with me .
but that &apos;s our act . yours and mine .
well , it &apos;s all been changed .
it &apos;s April or the whole proposition &apos;s cold .
they want a younger woman in the act , that &apos;s all , luscious .
a younger woman ?
Yeah , they want it younger , like April .
she &apos;s ideal .
a smile like hers is worth a million dollars .
she &apos;s got a swell figure and a pair of legs that ...
why , she &apos;s got more sex-appeal than ...
for a dame you couldn &apos;t stand the sight of a few days ago ... you seem to be taking a big interest in April and her sex-appeal .
professionally , sure .
Yeah ?
I wanna see her get ahead .
I got our future in mind .
what about my future ?
now , beautiful .
beautiful my eye .
listen , Hitch Nelson .
nobody &apos;s gonna do that act but me , see ?
I don &apos;t know what you and the Keith Office got up your sleeve but nobody &apos;s double-crossing Kitty Darling .
Oh , yeah ?
well , I &apos;ll show you how much I &apos;m double-crossing ya , wise girl .
you don &apos;t have to know I spent the whole morning with Gus Weinbaum begging him to keep you in your own show .
what are you trying to give me now ?
your two weeks is up tonight and Gus is all set to can ya .
you &apos;re a dirty liar .
all right . phone Gus and find out for yourself .
well , I &apos;m certainly going to call you on that one .
Bryant 9483 .
we &apos;ll just have a little showdown around here .
it will suit me fine .
Hello , I want to speak to Gus Weinbaum . this is Miss Darling .
Hello , Kitty ?
what &apos;s on your mind ?
what &apos;s this I hear about you not renewing my contract after the show tonight ?
well , you haven &apos;t got that quite right , Kitty .
the fact is I got Lou working on a book now ... called &quot; The Boarding School Girls &quot; .
and it &apos;s gotta have somebody in it that &apos;s young .
an ingenue lead , see ?
ingenue lead ?
I know the stuff the boys there out front want ...
I don &apos;t know why you shouldn &apos;t write that book around me .
you &apos;re not gonna be left out .
I got you down for a specialty number and a runway number ... so where do you get in to squawk ?
I &apos;m a liar , eh ?
I &apos;ll show Gus where he gets off .
I &apos;ll have a contract in my own terms in ten minutes .
Hello , girlie , get me Bryant 9400 .
Hello , I wanna speak to Dave Holtz .
I &apos;ll show the dirty little ...
Hello , Dave .
this is Kitty Darling .
say , Dave , I &apos;m closing with Parisian Flirts tonight .
how about grabbing yourself a real bet for your Summer Widows ?
thought I &apos;d give you first crack instead of fooling around with other stuff .
well , you better take him .
I got nothing for you .
Twenty managers killed in the rush .
I got plenty of friends in this town .
Ah , save your nickels , you may need them .
none of your wisecracks , Hitch Nelson .
it takes a wise girl to know when to quit and that &apos;s no wisecrack .
quit what ?
show business .
can &apos;t you see you &apos;re all washed out ?
why , you ...
what have you got left to give &apos;em ?
you &apos;ve been in it for twenty years . why kid yourself ? you ain &apos;t kidding anybody else .
you mind your own business .
I &apos;m not letting any cheap comic tell me how to run my affairs .
cheap comic , eh ?
if it hadn &apos;t been for me telling you how to run your affairs you &apos;d have been through long ago .
you &apos;re a joke . you &apos;re just a fat old woman .
look at yourself in the mirror . look at that neck , look at them wrinkles .
you better get wise to yourself and figure out where the coffee and cake &apos;s money is coming from next season .
right in that room is your meal ticket from now on .
and you let her marry some dope from the Brooklyn Navy outright when you needed her most .
she &apos;s gonna marry him too , if I have to buy a tin cup and sell pencils on Broadway .
not after I have a talk with her tonight .
if you dare to open your trap to her tonight we &apos;re through .
I &apos;m fired , eh ?
well , you &apos;re wrong .
I quit , see ?
so what do you think of that ?
I &apos;m sick of seeing you around here .
I guess I got everything out of you I want , babes .
I got plans and they don &apos;t include any old blondes .
get out !
get out before I kill you .
see you in the show business , beautiful
mommy , you look tired .
I am a little .
maybe you &apos;d better rest a little for a while instead of coming to dinner with us .
I think I &apos;d better .
you two don &apos;t want any old ladies along anyway .
you run along to your sailor boy .
mommy . mommy .
tell me , what &apos;s the matter ?
mommy , I &apos;m not going to be married .
I &apos;m never going to go away from you now .
you heard Hitch and me yelling at each other , is that it ?
come on now , cookie . don &apos;t go taking it that serious .
you know how Hitch and me are , always rowing about something .
he don &apos;t mean what he says half the time .
by tomorrow we &apos;ll both of us forget all about it ...
everything &apos;s okay .
don &apos;t let a thing like that get you down .
you run along now see your sailor boy . stop being that way .
no , mommy .
I &apos;m going to tell Tony I can &apos;t marry him .
but you must marry him , snooks .
after all we talked over ?
I &apos;m counting on it . you don &apos;t know how much it means to me .
no , mommy .
I just can &apos;t , that &apos;s all .
now you listen to me , young lady .
I &apos;m your ma , and I say you &apos;re going right down to dinner and fix it up .
and there &apos;ll be no more talk about it .
all right , mommy .
I &apos;ll fix it up .
and when I come to the theater tonight I wanna be sure you &apos;re gonna tell me everything &apos;s okay .
it will be . it will be .
come on now , kitten .
you gotta do this . and don &apos;t worry about me .
I &apos;m not a black number yet .
I know , mommy .
boy , that &apos;s happy music .
just for us .
wanna dance ?
no .
wish you didn &apos;t have to work tonight .
we could go to Coney Island .
I don &apos;t like Coney Island .
Aw , come on , you don &apos;t .
you did the other night .
that was the other night .
what &apos;s the matter with you , honey ?
why ?
nothing .
Oh , yes there is .
come on , let &apos;s have it .
Tony , I &apos;ll tell you .
I don &apos;t know how to say it , but ...
Tony , I don &apos;t want to get married .
say , don &apos;t say things like that , I got a week heart .
Tony , I mean it .
I like you an awful lot and all that ... but I just can &apos;t think of getting married right now .
what &apos;s the matter , honey ?
what &apos;s happened ?
nothing .
I don &apos;t think you &apos;ll be able to understand , but ...
being born on the stage and all well , getting married and leaving , it seems to be giving up everything .
you told me the other night you wanted to get out of the show business .
that &apos;s how I thought I felt .
when I come right down to it , I just can &apos;t , that &apos;s all .
you &apos;ll never know , Tony , what it feels like to be on the other side of those footlights .
and to hear them clap and clap for you .
it does something to a girl .
I don &apos;t know what .
April , I don &apos;t believe a word you &apos;re saying .
either you &apos;re lying to me or else you &apos;ve just been kidding yourself .
now , come on , let &apos;s dance and forget about it .
I don &apos;t want to dance .
I want you to get it through your head right now .
this is it , really .
mother signed a new contract today for a new show .
and there &apos;s a chance for me to go with her in a splendid part .
if I don &apos;t take it I know I &apos;ll be sorry all my life .
then we &apos;ll both be miserable .
but listen , honey .
that &apos;s no life for you .
well , I &apos;m not so sure that married life in some godforsaken farm is a life for me either .
after all , I &apos;m young . people tell me I &apos;m pretty .
here I &apos;ve got a big chance .
I might be a star .
now , I ask you , Tony ... what girl wouldn &apos;t grab at the chance to land on Broadway in a big show ?
none , I suppose .
not since you &apos;re locked to them .
let &apos;s pray it ended up with nothing to be locked with right now .
Tony , don &apos;t look at me like that .
makes me feel terrible .
I really think you &apos;re an awfully sweet boy , but after all , when it comes to love , why , I &apos;ve only known you five days .
you think of jumping into something and giving up a whole career ...
well , Tony , you ought to understand .
sure .
I mean , we &apos;ll still have lots of fun together .
just the same . go to lots of parties . why , we might even still be engaged .
no . I wouldn &apos;t want to feel like I &apos;m tying you down .
guess I &apos;d better go back to my ship .
you mean , enlist again ?
Yeah .
sailing for the West Indies .
I &apos;ve always wanted to see the West Indies .
but you &apos;ll come back .
sure , some day .
what time is it ?
eight o &apos;clock , almost .
I could just make it if I hurry .
Tony !
you &apos;re angry with me .
I didn &apos;t want you to be .
Tony , please try not to hate me .
please try to understand .
this was the best way for us both .
I don &apos;t hate you . I just gotta hurry , that &apos;s all .
you ought to be getting down to your show too , don &apos;t you ?
I &apos;ll walk to the subway with you .
it &apos;s on my way .
you &apos;ll be late .
I don &apos;t care .
check , please .
seventh floor , mam .
good night , Jim , I &apos;ll see you in the morning .
good night , honey .
well , thanks for coming down with me , April .
Oh , that was all right .
well , here &apos;s my train .
Bye , April .
Bye , Tony .
don &apos;t cry , kid .
there &apos;ll be another one along any minute .
cheer up .
April !
April !
April !
April !
April !
Aw , be quiet !

where &apos;s April ?
mother !
what &apos;s the matter ?
help me to my dressing room
well I &apos;ll be ...
where did she get ?
mother , you &apos;re sick .
don &apos;t worry about me .
is everything all right ?
everything &apos;s fine .
are you gonna be married right away ?
no , I sent him back to his ship , ma .
what &apos;s this you &apos;re saying ?
you lie down , you &apos;ll feel better .
tell me , tell me .
don &apos;t worry , it &apos;s all over .
I sent him away .
I guess it is jolly life on board .
it &apos;s a good thing we found out in time .
Oh , nothing matters now but you , mommy .
we &apos;ll always have each other .
nothing &apos;s ever going to separate us again .
Oh , my God .
what have you done ?
what have I done ?
mommy , you &apos;re not well .
my baby , my little baby .
well , this is a swell time to be showing up for a Saturday night show .
what &apos;s the matter with her ?
drunk ?
well , what if she is ?
drunk as a fool , look at her lying there , the gin-soaked old ...
you let my mother alone !
you men make me sick .
you don &apos;t care about anything as long as you can shove somebody on your filthy stage .
and make them shake for a bunch of gorillas .
Yeah ?
well that talk don &apos;t get me anywhere .
so far as I &apos;m concerned Kitty Darling &apos;s finished .
here I talk to Gus Weinbaum trying to keep her in the show here ... and look at her , blind , paralyzed , Saturday night with nobody to take her place .
I &apos;ll take her place .
I &apos;ll get out there and get those gorillas your money &apos;s worth .
now what do you think of that ?
me take a chance on a dumb chorus girl to fill a specialty number ?
you &apos;re crazy !
listen , she ain &apos;t so dumb .
I &apos;ve been rehearsing her for weeks .
she &apos;s swell , I &apos;m telling ya .
anyway ain &apos;t it be better take a chance with the kid ?
well , maybe it is .
hop to it , kid . but you &apos;d better be good .
come on , baby , wake up .
Oh , I &apos;ll be good all right .
I &apos;ll get out and give them what they want .
I &apos;ll show them , I &apos;ll show them !
now you &apos;re talkin &apos; .
you get out of my way .
well I &apos;ll be ...
come on , get out there and play again .
come on , get out there .
come on , girls , get out there . do something .
go ahead , get onstage there ...
come on , you get onstage too .
Tony ! Tony !
I came back because I thought , well , maybe ...
take me away from this terrible place .
you mean it ?
I never want to be in the stage again .
you know , I had a hunch you weren &apos;t telling me the truth .
Aw , come on , what &apos;s it all about ?
it &apos;s mother .
Tony , I can &apos;t go away and leave her now .
she &apos;s sick . she needs a home .
then let her come with us .
that &apos;ll be swell .
come on , let &apos;s go in and talk to her . I bet I can make her see it our way .
it would be wonderful if she would .
we &apos;ll always be together , won &apos;t we ?
Yes , honey .
all three of us .
all three of us .

is another train coming ?
you &apos;ve got so many flacons , you are worse than my daughter .
wait here until it stops raining .
do you know what ?
let it rain , you can spend the night in my house .
hurry up , Andrea , I must go to work .
you know that I am afraid of strangers , Father .
don &apos;t be silly , this man is no thief !
where would you go ?
there is no hotel in our village . stay here .
the storm must have cut off the wires .
I know you shall never come back ...
and ...
what &apos;s the matter ?
would you mind if I leave , Father ?
do you want to visit your aunt ?
very well then , go .
why do people forget so quickly ?
why do people forget so quickly ?
I yearn for you though I know you will never return . I do not dare to die .
it would kill my father if I told him . I am so helpless !
I cosset it inside of me , even if I feel that my life has reached its end .
I do not know why I write this letter , but I feel relief in knowing that you have not thought about me once .
my poor husband is waiting for me at the theatre .
what will you tell him about where you were ?
with my lover !
you would never say that !
your key !
who is that gentleman ?
where does he live ?
tell him to wait !
you can say whatever you wish !
I know you are lying !
I would not like to be in her shoes .
you &apos;re impossible , you would even delude a saint !
I will divorce you !
did your &quot; little daughter &quot; write ?
it is said he will soon be a grandfather !
they say she tied that man who spent the night at your house .
no one will dare touch the chastity of my daughter !
your child was stillborn . perhaps it is better for you this way .
how some men handle their love affairs .
you see , you were here a few days longer and bed and board costs money .
wandering aimlessly .
I am sending you some money , do not take everything so tragically .
but you wanted to go the other way .
the man who was to come for the blood transfusion is not here .
maybe I ...
do you know how you got injured ?
your wife saved you your life .
my wife ?
Yes , your wife . don &apos;t you remember ?
you brought her here in your car .
could you bring my wife here then ?
I am sorry but I can deliver this piano model only in a few weeks as I have just sold the last one .
my wife .
I can wait a few weeks for the other piano .
dangerous friendship .
you were not home , because you knew I would come .
he is a fine man . I hope he will make a good impression on you .
... And in the evening In the morning In the morning I ask you to reject my husband &apos;s invitation .
forgive me , I should have done that myself .
... I know what pain I have caused you .
you may laugh at whatever I say to apologise to you . but I love you .
have you forgiven me ?
yet in the evening ...
I love you and I am jealous of you because you love your husband .
Andrea , I want you to ...
do not lie to me , he is the man who had your picture !
who ?
that annoying man !
I do not know him at all !
I will keep an eye on that gentleman !
you must come with us tomorrow , we will be most pleased if you join us .
if you only knew what I think of him !
and what I think of you !
not even an angel could put up with you !
I love you so much because you are not like other men , you are not jealous .
I am not jealous , because I trust you .
I have a terrible headache .
I am so tired .
... I almost forgot .
I will give you back your key , you will need it for someone else .
on the &quot; trip &quot; .
on the &quot; trip &quot; .
don &apos;t you think that leading a simple family life is most fortunate ?
why don &apos;t you get married then ?
it is quite simple and easy .
that is what you think !
... I think you will lose .
do you want me to lose ?
we did not have time to tell you that we are leaving tomorrow .
it is my wife &apos;s wish . it is so nice in the south at this time of the year .
Yes , it is nice , indeed .
I hope to see you soon again !
what kind of a comedy is this !
why aren &apos;t you sincere , Andrea ?
I was never more sincere as today !
I think our trip will do you good , you will calm down .
I am calm , but you are jealous , and you are running away like a coward !
how &quot; love &quot; ends ...
give this letter to my husband at 5 o &apos;clock .
very well !
this is the end then !
you shall never see me again !
was anyone here ?
will you believe me if I say that no one ?
to loyalty - to all women !
I swear your wife is not in the room !
liar !
the past that shall always be the past .
shall we go ?
Yes , let us go !

&quot; at the man vis-à-vis &quot;
&quot; and gaze intently at him &quot;
&quot; what do they mean ? &quot;
&quot; I am , from head to foot &quot;

breakfast , Herr Professor .
come now , darling , the coffee &apos;s getting cold .

I &apos;m afraid I may have overindulged last night .
a few bottles of champagne .
you held it just fine .
one ?
two ?
three .
you really are a sweet one !
good ?
delicious . extraordinary !
you see ? you could have this every day .
there &apos;s no reason why not .
after all , I &apos;m not married .
I must get to the school ! I must hurry ... And get to the school !
come here !
stand still ! so !
what &apos;s this , no Adieu ?
give me a kiss .
do you love me too ?
Yes , yes !
Yes , yes ! Good-bye !

sit down !
Herr Professor , it stinks of garbage here !
garbage ! garbage !
silence ! I &apos;ll have you all locked up !
miserable brats !
leave the classroom . go to the school yard .
I &apos;ll deal with you later .
there &apos;s a lot I can understand .
but to risk one &apos;s entire future for that kind of woman ?
I beg your pardon , Herr Director .
you are speaking of my future wife !
you can &apos;t be serious .
I am completely serious !
I will not hear another word !
I &apos;m very sorry , my dear colleague ...
but I &apos;ll have to report the matter .
get your stuff packed .
the train won &apos;t wait for you !
come in !
Hello , Professor ! make yourself useful !
- Why &apos;d I marry you ? - I wonder about that too .
put the flowers in here .
and don &apos;t crush them .
why are you standing there ? you know the way !
how nice of you to come say good-bye .
my dear Miss Lola , I ...
and such lovely flowers ! thanks !
don &apos;t make such a long face .
I &apos;ll be back next year .
my dear Miss Lola , I brought you something else as well .
would you accept this gift from me ?
and at the same time may I ask for your hand ?
you want to marry me ?
Yes .
God , you &apos;re so cute !
I hope , my child ...
you are fully aware of the gravity of this moment .
long may they live ! long may they live !
three time up !
long may they live ! long may they live !
three time up !

ladies ...
my very honorable gentlemen !
- It gives me great pleasure to ... - Enough ...
enough of your blather !
here we go again .
my wedding ceremony was like this , so lovely .
if I had known you then ...
perhaps I &apos;d be the wife of a professor now ...
instead of this conjurer .
that &apos;s right , I am a conjurer !
we &apos;re in for more of his stupid stunts !
sit down now !
would you deny the professor a display of my art ?
with your permission ... I &apos;ll pull a few eggs from under your nose .
as you can see ... I have nothing ... In my hand !
here , take it , please ! there &apos;s something to be proud of .
watch this , Herr Professor .
good ... Yes ? please !
honey , hand me my small case .
Ah !
you are a clumsy one .
why did you bring the postcards ?
what a dumb question .
we sell them every night !
as long as I &apos;ve a penny to my name , they will not be sold !
well , you never know ! we &apos;d better keep them .
&quot; Beware of blonde women &quot;
&quot; they have a certain something &quot;
&quot; you may not see it all at once &quot;

&quot; but always keep in mind : &quot; &quot; Beware of the predator ! &quot;

who &apos;d buy a postcard from you ?
go ahead and stare .
you &apos;re not at the college now .
he &apos;s right , you know .
you really should shave .

Yes !

- He hasn &apos;t hurt you .
- You stay out of this .
your husband &apos;s a big star . here ...

you &apos;ll change your mind .
I will not change my mind .
isn &apos;t that just like you ?
for five years you &apos;ve lived off this woman .
and now ... When you finally can earn a few cents ...
Herr Professor says : no , I won &apos;t go !
- Leave him alone ! - No ! - He will go .
- I won &apos;t !

I won &apos;t do it . - Never !
- No one &apos;ll force you . never !

the lover who is yet to show
though silently we hope him yonder

I &apos;ve loved you since an early date

I am so sad I shall expire
you clumsy oaf !

I didn &apos;t get any cake .
I didn &apos;t have any cake . nothing at all .
I &apos;m so sorry , believe me .

Firmin !
Joseph !

you thought of everything !
going already ?
let &apos;s do some serious talking .
that &apos;s what we came for .
will that do ?
it &apos;ll do .
don &apos;t bother !
if we blab , you lose everything .
your status . your fortune .
that &apos;s what you &apos;re gonna share with us .
so that &apos;s it !
is that all ?
what brings you gentlemen here ?
how &apos;s that ?
we received a report on a housebreaking .
housebreaking !
you came for nothing .
please forgive them .
but I was tied hand and foot !
I was doing my duty .
as you always do .
- What are you doing here ? - Papers !
is this a joke ?
we &apos;re done for .
he took us for a ride .
we can &apos;t get out .
trapped like rats !
we can &apos;t stay here ! isn &apos;t there a combination ?
things look bad .
- What is it ?
- They &apos;ll blow the whistle on me .
so what ?
we have to get ready to run .
- What was that ?
- The police are after me .
you idiot !
shut the door , quick !
may I help you ?
it &apos;s nothing , sir , but a man &apos;s slipped into the plant .
a man ?
we &apos;re looking for him .
I haven &apos;t seen a soul .
but be my guest , have a good look .
you took the case ?
the case I put here .
I just saw a guy with it !
what are you doing here ?
we &apos;re friends of the director .
sure !
we came with him tonight .
that &apos;s right .
isn &apos;t that right ?
- He &apos;s a pal . - Aren &apos;t you ?
is that all you have to say ?
if you don &apos;t speak up , they &apos;ll arrest us .
but you &apos;ll be joining us soon .
be seeing you , then .
Goodbye .
here , Inspector , look at this . we &apos;ll look at it later .
take &apos; em away !
let &apos;s move it !
in our new plant , men will have no other task other than supervising the machines .
the machines will do all the work .
they will manufacture our phonographs .
&quot; organization and progress , &quot; that is our motto .
this explains the success of our earlier factories .
it will be the same under our new enterprise , which will now start up before your very eyes .
won &apos;t you cut the garland ?
won &apos;t you cut this garland ?
cut it ?
step over here .
all hail Progress , child of Science
which extends its hand to the future
the golden torch of hope ...
it &apos;s very simple :
we introduce the materials there .
we stand back and then ...
there you have it !
it guides its sister , Human Intelligence ,
towards the sunlight ...
my congratulations !
it &apos;s marvelous !
ladies and gentlemen ...
on this solemn occasion , when the Machine has proven that if it can replace the hand of man , it cannot replace his brain , allow me first to pay homage to the brilliant creator behind the destiny of this magnificent factory .
this man who , despite humble beginnings , forged a place for himself , and earned the respect of his contemporaries , whose name is forever linked with phonograph history , this philanthropist , this great citizen ...
this scoundrel !
this riffraff !
it &apos;s him , all right .
- You recognize him ?
- You bet I do .
I arrested him .
if you want to arrest him again , you &apos;d better hurry .
he &apos;s been tipped off . he &apos;ll make a run for it .
all right . get down there .
this historic moment , when the fiery gaze of the future looks back on the dazzling flame of the present .
I haven &apos;t said everything .
gentlemen , the opening of this factory is my crowning achievement .
I have nothing more to do among you .
I am leaving you .
I hereby make a gift of my factories to all whose who have worked with me .
the machines will now work for them .
destiny beckons me to other paths .
as a great poet once wrote :
&quot; let us raise our souls and our hearts &quot; As the mother raises her child . &quot;
these words come to mind on this day when I wish ...
we can lift our heads high and declare that the future destiny of mankind seems to bear great promise .
we will soon taste the fruit ...
when all things around us operate
friends , let us enjoy our idleness
beneath sunny skies what a sweet fate
to laze about and sing like this
let &apos;s indulge in this infinite elation
it takes one kiss for it to start
my whole being finds exhiliration
in the gentle beating of your heart
you must never think of marrying
when you were born to live on the road
while awaiting the wisdom age may bring
think of love as a mere episode
that &apos;s our fate
old mate
my old friend , the Earth is round
there are women wherever you go
when we finally run out of ground
that &apos;s the time to take it slow
everywhere , if you take a chance
everywhere , life is a melody
everywhere , it &apos;s wine and romance
so here &apos;s to us two and liberty !
driver .
- Driver , stop ! - What troubles you in there ?
why do you want to stop ? the man up there , he is bleeding to death .
not here . brakes won &apos;t hold .
orderly . orderly !
and just as guilty as a soldier would be , who deserted his post under fire .
now , in making an example of you , I ...
I beg your pardon , sir . I have some wounded outside .
I am looking for the ... Oh , yes , yes , yes . you want the Italian unit .
we &apos;re the English here , you see . Yes , Number 207 . they &apos;re in the other wing .
moved in today . Yes , out that way , straight ahead .
- Thank you , Major . - Hmm .
what &apos;s the girlfriend been doing ?
typical male conceit !
I think they &apos;re going to send her back home .
that &apos;s a dirty shame . - She &apos;ll be disgraced .
- It &apos;s regulations .
at least they might let her have her baby here . if they send her back now , all her friends will know .
- And her family . - She &apos;s only herself to blame .
this is war , Fergy , and she loved him .
Shh , here they come .
well , is it necessary for us all to be here at one time ?
get back to your posts . you will be packed and ready to leave within the hour .
Molly ?
can I help you pack ?
I guess so . if you want to . why , of course I want to .
- Good girl .
- I beg your pardon ? I say , she &apos;s the only human being in the whole lot of us .
I &apos;m sorry Miss Barkley appears to sympathise with one who has disgraced the uniform we all wear .
- Baby ! - Rinaldi ! - Frederico !
you &apos;re filthy . you Anglo-Saxons !
you &apos;re not too clean yourself .
did you bring me some good cases , baby ?
did you have trouble finding us ? - No .
- How do you feel ?
- Is there going to be an offensive ? - There &apos;s not ... Were you under fire ?
Madonna , but I worried about you !
Yes , I can see how much you &apos;ve been worrying . seven operations today , baby .
and one of them was beautiful . I took the heart out .
it lay in my hand and it beat like this .
you should have seen it . it was lovely ! soon , Rinaldi will be the best surgeon in all the corps .
then , in all the army .
and some day , in all of Italy . - Why not in all the world ?
- Why not ?
you will like it here , baby .
what sort of a town is this ? any girls ?
many beautiful English nurses . - No , I mean , girls .
- Girls , too , a house full of them . another Villa Rossa ?
some of them have never been to the front before . perhaps .
but the nurses are much nicer . the most beautiful is Miss Barkley . I am in love with her .
- Does she know it ?
- Not yet .
- Have you any money ? - Yes . - Lend me 50 lire .
- What for ? I want to make on Miss Barkley the impression of a man of sufficient wealth .
- All right . - Thank you .
you are my great and good friend and financial protector .
and you &apos;re an ass .
and now we will eat and drink , and I will take you to meet Miss Barkley .
but you must make for me a good impression upon her . now , listen ...
but you must .
and you can have a nurse , too . there is another one named Miss Ferguson .
she is also very , very nice . - No . - &quot; No &quot; ?
first , we will eat and drink , and then we &apos;ll go and see the girls who have never been to the front before .
Yes ? Yes .
you know what an American is ?
- Yes . - What is it ?
she doesn &apos;t know .
- Well , I &apos;m an American . - Then what are you doing here ?
- Drinking , mostly .
- He liked the uniform .
wrong . I liked their language .
then what were you doing in Italy ?
studying .
studying what ? architecture .
you know what that is ?
- Yes . - What ?
you see , she doesn &apos;t know .
- Neither do I .
- Oh , you &apos;ve had too much wine . it &apos;s filthy wine .
it takes the enamel off your teeth and leaves it on the roof of your mouth .
- Where was I ? - Architecture .
Oh , yes . look ... I &apos;ll explain .
this , my dear , is called an arch .
the arch , my dear , is perhaps the oldest of architectural devices .
arch . architecture .
the very word will tell you how inextricably the two are one .
in a word , my dear , architecture is the most ancient of the arts .
just as yours is the most ancient of the professions . you &apos;d better put your shoe on , or you &apos;ll get cold feet .
if you please , I &apos;d like to go now .
the air raid seems to be over .
Catherine !
Catherine ! - Catherine ! - Here I am , Fergy .
- Oh , I worried . Oh ! - Oh .
nobody saw where you went .
who &apos;s that man ? Oh , I don &apos;t know . some lunatic .
what if we take the mountains to the north ?
behind them are more mountains , and behind those , more yet .
and we take them all only if the Austrians stop fighting . one side must stop .
- Stop ? it will go on forever . - Like him .
the Priest wants the Austrians to win the war . - No , no , no . it is not true .
- But you don &apos;t want us to attack . if we must have war , I suppose we have to attack .
Oh , but so many die that way . but what is death to a Christian .
don &apos;t encourage him , Fergy . Frederico .
- Oh , you are back safe . - Hello , Father . - I am so glad .
- The Priest prayed for you , Frederico . - Every time you go out he does the same .
you nearly missed the party . but it is very dull . but Miss Barkley is here , and her friend Miss Ferguson .
the one you will like . come .
Miss Barkley , permit me to present to you my friend and war brother , Lieutenant Henry .
he has just returned back from the front .
how do you do ?
and this is Miss Ferguson .
- How do you do ? - How do you do ?
now he begins again , that fellow . quick , let us go into the garden .
now , you stay here . I will find something for us to drink .
Asti ? Grappa ? vermouth ?
- Which do you like ? - All of them .
then you shall have all of them .
- Nice out here . - Hmm , isn &apos;t it ?
we seem fated to bump into each other in the dark .
I mistook you for someone else . so I gathered .
- I had been drinking .
- I gathered that , too . - Mad ?
- No .
- You &apos;re an American , aren &apos;t you ?
- Yes . well , then what are you doing in the Italian army ?
it &apos;s not really the army , it &apos;s only the ambulance .
it &apos;s very odd , though .
why did you do it ? I don &apos;t know .
why did you ? Oh , I joined up in England .
- Where is Miss Ferguson ?
- Why don &apos;t you go see ? Yes , do bring her out , Captain Rinaldi .
- Have some ? - Thanks .
he &apos;s sore .
what for ?
because I &apos;m here with you . women prefer him , as a rule .
shall we take a walk ?
Yes , let &apos;s .
where is he now ?
- Who ? - The boy you &apos;re engaged to . - He &apos;s dead .
he was killed in the Somme . were you engaged long ?
eight years . we grew up together .
why didn &apos;t you marry ?
I didn &apos;t know what the war was like then .
if I had it to do over again , I &apos;d marry him , or anything .
when I joined up , I remember having this silly idea that he might come to the hospital where I was , with a sabre cut , I suppose , and a bandage around his head .
something picturesque . this is a picturesque front .
not France . he didn &apos;t have a sabre cut .
they blew him to bits .
what are you thinking about now ?
about whisky . what about whisky ?
about how nice it is . and you &apos;re nice , too .
no . - Why not ?
- No , don &apos;t . - Yes . - No , please !
I &apos;m sorry . did I hurt you ?
it &apos;s all right . I &apos;m dreadfully sorry .
really . I ... I just couldn &apos;t bear the nurses &apos; -evening-off aspect of it .
it &apos;s quite all right . I don &apos;t mind at all .
poor man . you see , I &apos;ve been leading a funny sort of life .
besides , you &apos;re so very beautiful .
you don &apos;t have to talk a lot of nonsense , I said I &apos;m sorry .
we could get along .
couldn &apos;t we ?
you &apos;re sweet . - No , I &apos;m not . - Yes , you &apos;re a dear .
I &apos;d be very glad to have you kiss me now , if you don &apos;t mind .
you are looking for someone ?
- Have you seen Miss Barkley ?
- Miss Barkley ?
- Didn &apos;t she go out there with you ?
- With me ?
- No , no , no . - But just a little while ago ...
I thought I saw her go out to the garden gate with the Lieutenant Henry .
she went out with an officer ?
alone ? well , perhaps I was mistaken , you know , it is quite dark out there .
Oh , she wouldn &apos;t do that .
no . no , I am sure I was mistaken .
where is she , then ?
you &apos;re a grand girl .
I &apos;m a crazy girl .
- Why ? - To stay out here .
it &apos;s nice . isn &apos;t that enough ?
Hmm , it &apos;s nice . I suppose that has to be enough for people who are living as we live .
back home , I &apos;d have courted you and sent you flowers .
out here , you crowd it all into one hour .
isn &apos;t that the way it &apos;s got to be , out here ?
look ... Tomorrow morning I &apos;ve got to go up to the front again .
and if a shell got me and you never saw me again , then we &apos;d both be sorry that we &apos;ve been so formal and waited .
besides , what &apos;s there so fine in putting it off , dragging it out ,
- giving me your lips tonight ...
- No ... - ... your throat tomorrow ... - No .
no , please ...
Catherine ?
thanks for the lovely concert . - I ...
- I hope you are not worried about Miss Barkley .
it &apos;s not like her to disappear this way .
well , perhaps she felt ill and went home alone .
perhaps . good night . come , girls , come .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
it doesn &apos;t matter . if it had to happen , I &apos;d rather it were like this .
I couldn &apos;t know . in a church or out under the stars .
- Well , why not ?
- &quot; Why not &quot; ?
there &apos;s a war on .
and tonight , who cares , and tomorrow , who knows .
what did you say your name was ?
stop it . if you ...
if you knew how I was back home , you &apos;d see the funny side of it .
please , stop it .
Oh ! we blame everything on the war , but that &apos;s rot .
it &apos;s something in ourselves .
the lady sat in the public square and mourned her lost innocence .
don &apos;t be sorry . I &apos;m not .
I love you .
Oh , darling .
did you have a nice , uh , time , baby ?
you made progress with her , eh ?
we &apos;re friends . if that &apos;s what you mean .
I mean , uh ... Was she nice to you , practically speaking ?
- Shut up !
- I am a man of extreme delicacy , - but was she ...
- Rinaldi !
will you please shut up ?
if you wanna be a friend of mine , shut up .
I am your best friend and your war brother . then shut up .
Miss Barkley prefers you to me . that is very clear .
but Miss Ferguson is very nice , too .
you like her ? no .
that you of all people ...
a lot of geese , that &apos;s what you are !
silly geese ! stuffed with bunk about woman &apos;s part in the war .
we must bring solace to the men who fight , sacrifice ourselves , give ourselves .
if you &apos;d known him for a long time , or been in love with him ...
but you only met him tonight .
how long must you know a man before you can love him ?
are you pretending to be in love with that man ?
I think I am , Fergy . I must be .
you &apos;re just another conquest to him .
one in a hundred . you &apos;ll probably never see him again .
he said if he &apos;d met me back home , he &apos;d have courted me , sent me flowers ...
I suppose I won &apos;t ever see him again .
Ciao , baby . good luck .
- Turn back . - Back ?
Yes , back !
- I wanna see Miss Barkley . - She &apos;s on duty .
wait , you can &apos;t go in there .
Hey , why have you come back in here for ?
the Tenente , he knows what he &apos;s doing .
please .
what &apos;s wrong , Bonello ? going to ever get started here ?
we got plenty of time . Oh , the ...
I thought you started . what are you doing here ?
we come back , Signor Capitano .
Tenente forgot something . Oh .
Hi . you &apos;re all right , aren &apos;t you ?
Yes , I &apos;m all right .
I came to ... I thought ...
you see ... I ...
I &apos;m going to be away for a while , and I didn &apos;t want you to think that I &apos;d just gone away .
no , I ...
what I mean is , I &apos;d hate to have you feel that ...
that it wasn &apos;t important to me . about ... About us .
uh , I don &apos;t exactly know how to say it .
you &apos;ve said it very nicely , dear , thank you .
no , I don &apos;t mean ...
- You mustn &apos;t feel ...
- Will you be gone long ?
no . only a few days . there &apos;s gonna be a show above ...
nothing much , I guess . a show ? you &apos;ll be careful , won &apos;t you ?
I won &apos;t get hit . hold this .
here . it &apos;s a Saint Anthony .
they say a Saint Anthony is very useful to guard you from harm .
I &apos;ll take good care of him .
I wish I could kiss you .
he is my friend and a good soldier .
I do not like to see him lose his head over a woman .
aren &apos;t you exaggerating a bit ?
I think not .
couldn &apos;t we send her back to the base , Major ?
Oh , if you could send her away , it would simplify everything .
could perhaps send her to Milan . excellent , my dear Major !
magnificent ! no wonder the English are first in diplomacy .
er , what did you say her name was ?
we won &apos;t get anything else to eat once the attack starts .
this is all they &apos;ve given me .
starting to eat , Tenente ?
no , we &apos;ll all eat together . come on , sit down to it .
- Thank you . - Here , you cut this .
wash it down with wine , Tenente .
who goes to the attack ?
Bersaglieri .
if nobody would attack , the war would be over .
that was a big one .
- Four hundred twenty ? - No , 305 .
- Sounded like a Skoda to me .
- Skoda , that &apos;s what I say .
are you badly hit , Tenente ?
anybody hurt ?
my leg . hold my neck , Tenente .
you were right , Tenente .
Lacerations of the scalp and possible fracture of the skull .
Multiple superficial wounds of the left and right thigh , left and right knee , and right foot .
Profound wounds of right knee and foot incurred in line of duty .
- Come on , lift him up a little more . - All right . carefully !
hurry , hurry !
how do you feel , baby ?
Rinaldi . what are you doing here ?
Bonello telephoned me .
the Major gave me permission to come .
no one shall hurt you , baby .
I won &apos;t let them . no butcher is going to touch my war brother .
only Rinaldi can take you and never hurt you .
you must forgive me , baby , for talking so much , but I am ...
I &apos;m very moved to see you badly wounded .
how did it happen ? I will see you are decorated for bravery .
perhaps we can get you the medaglia d &apos;argento , but surely the bronze one .
did you carry somebody on your back ?
I didn &apos;t carry anybody .
I couldn &apos;t move .
surely there was something heroic . tell me what you did .
I was blown up eating cheese .
don &apos;t worry , baby .
I will fix you so that you are as good as new . you will see .
every day , I learn to do things smoother , quicker .
soon , very soon , you will be walking again .
I brought a present for you .
you will find it under your blanket , next to your heart . it is a bottle of brandy , baby .
very good brandy . the infantry captured it from the Austrians on San Gabriele .
I have another surprise for you .
take a deep breath .
where do you think you will go from here ?
to the Italian hospital where they have the male nurses with the beards ? no .
I will arrange everything with my friend , the British Major .
you will go to Milan . to the beautiful Miss Barkley .
that makes you happy , huh ?
think of Rinaldi , left all alone with the war . no one to make fun of .
while you are in Milan with the beautiful Miss Barkley .
making love in Milan to the chaste Miss Barkley .
look out for the step .
why do you stop ?
I am the superintendent .
may I have your medical papers , please ?
they &apos;re in my coat . in the buttoned-down pocket .
take him up those stairs , down the corridor .
his room is the one at the end . you show them , Giulio .
who are you ?
I am the porter , Signor Tenente . come , follow me .
now , Signor Tenente , we must lift you off the bed .
- All right . but keep my legs straight . - Si , Signor Tenente .
anything more , Signor Tenente ?
- Get me some brandy . - No , it &apos;s not allowed , Signor Tenente .
wasn &apos;t I wounded , fighting for the glory of Italy ?
- You &apos;ll find some money in my pocket . - As you wish .
- So it &apos;s you .
- Ferguson . - Is Catherine here ?
- As if you didn &apos;t know .
I believe that &apos;s why you got wounded . - Where is she ? - You ought to be still .
here &apos;s your chart . I must take your temperature .
does she know I &apos;m here ?
under the arm , please .
- Hello , darling . - Catherine .
you &apos;re lovely .
- Are you badly hurt ?
- You &apos;re lovely . Oh , my poor darling . it &apos;s your leg , isn &apos;t it ?
- You &apos;re the loveliest thing I ever saw . - Oh ...
I have to go now , darling , I can &apos;t stay .
- You &apos;ll come back ? - Later . - But we have to be awfully careful .
- You &apos;ve got to come back . I will , when I can .
- Tonight ? - I &apos;ll try .
somebody &apos;s coming . tonight .
I &apos;ll take that thermometer now . good gracious !
fetch the doctor .
it &apos;s a miracle you &apos;re not delirious with such a fever .
- I haven &apos;t got any fever .
- Stay quiet , please . it &apos;s not what you think .
I have brought you a few little things .
and this is mosquito netting , and this is a bottle of vermouth . you like vermouth , huh ?
- And these are English papers . - Thank you , Father .
it &apos;s very good of you to come .
Oh , but I mustn &apos;t stay long . they warned me not to tire you .
you seem very tired yourself .
I am tired , but I have no right to be .
- You have the war disgust .
- No . but I hate the war .
- I don &apos;t enjoy it . - But you do not mind it . you do not see it .
Oh , you must forgive me . I know you are wounded .
that was an accident . still , even wounded , you do not see it . I can tell .
I do not see it myself , but I feel it a little .
come in , Cat .
don &apos;t go yet , Father .
it &apos;s still early . you are sure ? with the operation in the morning , he should rest .
Oh , he &apos;s strong . he has such a lovely temperature .
it is always normal . I &apos;m very proud of his temperature .
maybe all our children will have fine temperatures , too .
our children will probably have beastly temperatures .
don &apos;t mind us , Father . we &apos;re in love .
I know . I could see it in your faces .
you approve , don &apos;t you , Father ?
you spoke of children . this , too , is the war .
without the war , you would have married in God &apos;s grace .
is it not so ?
and you ?
I hadn &apos;t thought about it like that , but ... Yes , I suppose so .
father , are you ...
of course you realise , Father , that army regulations prevent us from marrying ?
they &apos;d send Catherine home .
poor Cat . such a crazy marriage .
at least I &apos;m in white .
no orange blossoms .
I can smell them .
no organ music .
I can hear it plainly .
it was a foolish notion , perhaps .
I have not the right to say you are married . yet , it has made me happy to do this .
for now , from my heart , I can say I bless you in His name .
Goodbye and be happy , both of you .
thank you , Father .
- Give my regards to the mess .
- I will . and get well soon .
I will come again the next time I am in Milan . - Goodbye , my dear . - Goodbye .
is Miss Barkley here ?
Uh-uh . no .
shut the door .
- I can &apos;t . - Please , darling .
we mustn &apos;t . your operation &apos;s in the morning .
it &apos;s our wedding night . Oh , darling .
you &apos;ll have to take your oil .
Castor oil ? no . you &apos;ll take it from me .
... if you stay .
Oh , darling , darling .
I want what you want . there isn &apos;t any &quot; me &quot; any more , just what you want . you &apos;re sweet .
don &apos;t I make a lovely wife ? such a lovely wife .
feel our hearts beat .
no wonder my heart beats . I &apos;m mad about you .
that &apos;s the opera I made my debut in at La Scala .
- They threw benches at him .
- That &apos;s a lie !
Yes , they did . I threw six benches myself .
that &apos;s not funny .
Oh , now he is offended . he &apos;ll get over it .
that &apos;s his sore spot .
we always tease him .
you don &apos;t care whom you hurt . now , don &apos;t you get mad , too .
Catherine and I were thinking of asking you to our wedding .
weren &apos;t we , Cat ?
- You &apos;ll never get married . - We will ! no , you won &apos;t .
you &apos;ll fight before you marry .
- Oh , we never fight . - You &apos;ve time yet . we won &apos;t fight ever .
you &apos;ll die , then .
fight or die . that &apos;s what people do .
- They don &apos;t marry . - Why , Fergy !
I &apos;m not crying .
maybe you &apos;ll be all right , you two .
watch out you don &apos;t get her in trouble .
- I won &apos;t get her into trouble . - You better not .
or I &apos;ll kill you .
why , Fergy ...
what is the matter with her ?
she doesn &apos;t like me , that &apos;s all . Oh , no .
she just likes me more .
are you on night duty tonight ?
Yes , but you won &apos;t care . you &apos;ll go right off to sleep . you wait and see .
darling , how many other girls have you ever loved ?
none . how many , really ?
none .
how many have you , um ...
how do you say it ... Loved ?
- None . - You &apos;re lying to me .
- Of course . - Oh , that &apos;s right . you just keep right on lying , that &apos;s what I want you to do .
were they pretty ?
I have never been with anyone .
that &apos;s right , darling .
what were they like ?
I don &apos;t know anything about it .
you &apos;re just mine .
that &apos;s true . you &apos;ve never belonged to anyone else .
I don &apos;t care if you have , though . I &apos;m not afraid of them .
only , don &apos;t tell me about them .
you never told them you loved them , did you ?
- No . - I knew you wouldn &apos;t .
- Oh , darling , I do love you .
- Then , kiss me .
- Right here on the street ? - Yes .
I &apos;ll go in first .
so ...
what is this , if I may ask ? what was in it ?
that &apos;s kummel .
that &apos;s the best kind . it comes in those bear-shaped bottles from Russia .
and these ?
that &apos;s brandy , wine and whisky .
and I &apos;ve been pitying you for being wounded .
pity is something that is wasted on you .
- Thank you . - If you &apos;re so anxious not to go back to the front ,
I should think you &apos;d try something more intelligent .
not self-inflicted alcoholism !
- What ? - I said , &quot; Alcoholism ! &quot;
and I also say that I &apos;ll see your convalescent leave is cancelled .
you &apos;ll go back to the front tomorrow night .
have I time for a drink before the train leaves ? - For the front ? - Yes .
- About 20 minutes , Signor Capitano . - Right .
it &apos;s a fine room , a lovely room .
it &apos;s all right .
the red plush is just the thing .
those mirrors are very attractive , too .
people who go in for vice seem to have very good taste about it .
Hmm , you &apos;re a grand girl . Oh , darling .
I wish we could do something really simple .
everything we do seems so innocent and right .
you &apos;re a fine , simple girl .
I am a simple girl . nobody but you ever realised it .
at first , I thought you were a crazy girl .
I was a little crazy at first . was that your train ?
maybe .
it makes up at Turin . but it stays in the station here until time to leave .
there &apos;s really lots of time .
&quot; but at my back , I always hear Time &apos;s winged chariot hurrying near &quot;
I know that poem . it &apos;s by Marvell .
Oh , it &apos;s about a girl who wouldn &apos;t live with a man .
listen .
it &apos;s only the rain .
I hate the rain . I like it .
I &apos;m afraid of the rain .
- Afraid , why ?
- I ... - Well , perhaps it &apos;s silly .
- What ?
tell me . - No . don &apos;t make me .
- Tell me . all right .
I &apos;m afraid of the rain because sometimes I see me dead in it .
no ! and sometimes I see you dead in it .
- That &apos;s more likely . - Oh , now , darling , don &apos;t say that .
that is your train .
time &apos;s winged chariot .
I &apos;ll come with you , hmm ?
no , please , I don &apos;t want you ... Not ...
not at the station .
all right , darling . how often will you write ?
as often as I can . do they read your letters ?
they can &apos;t read English enough to hurt anything .
well , I &apos;ll make them very confusing .
but not too confusing . Oh , I should have got you a going-away gift .
a whistle to make you feel better in the dark . or a sword .
I &apos;m sure we could get a used sword very cheap .
Swords aren &apos;t very useful at the front .
Oh , I see , they get in the way of your legs when you &apos;re running .
they might be useful at mess , though .
I &apos;m afraid I have to start , darling .
I hate to leave our fine house .
so do I .
we never stay settled very long in a home , do we ?
we will .
I &apos;ll have a fine home for you when you come back .
say , &quot; I &apos;ll come back to Catherine . &quot;
I &apos;ll come back to Catherine .
I &apos;ll always come back .
maybe this time , you &apos;ll be hurt just a little in the foot .
- Or the lobe of the ear . - Oh , no , no , no . I want your ears just the way they are .
your feet have been hurt already .
I want a ticket to Switzerland , please .
- To where , signora , to what town ?
- The nearest one to Italy . that would be Brissago , signora .
- Then give me a ticket to Brissago . - All right . Oh ...
Oh , Fergy , I was afraid you wouldn &apos;t come . would you mind telling me what this is all about ?
- So I gathered by this , but where ?
why ? to Switzerland , to have a baby .
Oh .
I knew he &apos;d get you in trouble .
Oh , now , it wasn &apos;t his fault , really , Fergy .
what &apos;s he going to do about it ?
he doesn &apos;t know it . you didn &apos;t tell him ?
what would be the good ? it would only worry him . he &apos;d have to go anyway .
aren &apos;t you going to tell him ?
well , not yet . I may write him from Switzerland .
- You &apos;re a fool .
- Here , signora . - On Track 3 .
- Thank you . what &apos;s the hurry ?
why tonight ? I couldn &apos;t go back to that hospital . I couldn &apos;t stand it .
not with him gone . but you &apos;ll be all alone in Switzerland .
don &apos;t worry , Fergy , I &apos;ll be all right .
you &apos;re not afraid of anything , are you ?
only of going back to that hospital .
don &apos;t scold me , Fergy .
I &apos;ll carry it .
&quot; I &apos;ve always told you I was a crazy girl .
&quot; I couldn &apos;t bear Milan with you away .
&quot; so I &apos;ve chucked the war and come to live in this little Swiss town &quot; as near as possible to the Italian border and you .
&quot; and , darling , it &apos;s an adorable place and we &apos;ll be very happy here .
&quot; I &apos;ve taken a suite ...
&quot; ... suite in the best hotel . &quot; and I &apos;m fairly wallowing in luxury .
&quot; the bed is Empire and fit for an empress .
&quot; there &apos;s a maroon velvet carpet , ankle-deep , &quot; and a bathroom ... Oh , darling , the bathroom !
&quot; it &apos;s of black marble with silver fittings .
&quot; I &apos;ve just dined in state at my sitting-room window ,
&quot; from which there is a divine view of the lake shimmering in moonlight . &quot;
I &apos;m an awful liar , darling .
it &apos;s not really a nice place at all .
it &apos;s mean , cheap and horrible .
but it doesn &apos;t matter where I live , because I don &apos;t really live at all when I &apos;m not with you .
what I really wanna tell you is that ...
that I shall lie awake in the dark and cry , because you &apos;re not here .
I &apos;m lonely and frightened .
- Hurry , baby . - Why ?
- Time to go . - Go where ?
but I told you before , to the Villa Rossa .
- New girls . everybody &apos;s going . - Not me .
but you must . it will be a fine party . and , besides , I said you would go .
I can &apos;t . I &apos;ve got to write a letter . Oh , to that little ...
every day , more letters .
you might as well be married . that &apos;s my business .
Oh , baby . how you ever come back to me ?
serious like a shopkeeper with a liver .
where is my war brother who used to get drunk with me and go to the Villa Rossa every night ?
leave me alone , will you ? why ?
isn &apos;t she just a girl ?
keep her out of this .
sacred subject . believe me , baby , sacred subjects are not good for soldiers .
why don &apos;t you be like me ?
all fire and smoke .
and nothing inside .
- Come on , baby .
- You &apos;re drunk , stop it .
of course I am drunk !
you come with me and you will be drunk , too . come on , baby .
Oh , I am sorry . now you must come .
there is no more ink . get your hands off me and get out !
poor baby .
tomorrow I will get you drunk and I will take out your liver and I will put you in a good Italian liver and make a man of you again .
Ciao , baby .
you &apos;re going out , Signor Capitano ?
- Yes , why ? - The mail just came , Signor Capitano .
- You censor it . - Signor capitano ...
the officers &apos; mail , too ?
aren &apos;t you gonna open them , Signor Capitano ?
no ! I &apos;m in a hurry .
- Send this one back .
- Yes , Signor Capitano . I do not like to see him lose his head over a woman .
Yes , Signor capitano .
and today my letters came back . every one I &apos;d ever written to her . came back ?
just marked &quot; Return to sender . person unknown . &quot;
well , that &apos;s very strange . Thirty-two letters .
she never got one .
- Well , that &apos;s why she never wrote you .
- No . she &apos;d have written me anyway .
something &apos;s happened to her . - Have you tried to ...
- I can &apos;t get any information at all . - I &apos;ve got to go and find her myself .
- How can you ? I &apos;m going to Milan . I &apos;ll find her .
but aren &apos;t all leaves of absence forbidden since that battle in the north began ?
- I &apos;m going anyway . - No , that &apos;s desertion .
- I don &apos;t care , I &apos;m going .
- You &apos;ll be caught . - You mustn &apos;t do this , Frederico .
- Yes , I must . that &apos;s what I wanted to tell you , Padre .
what does this war mean to me any more ?
what does anything mean , but finding her ?
- But Frederico , consider the ... - I can depend on you , Padre ?
say goodbye to Rinaldi and the others for me .
- When are you leaving ? - Now .
while they are at dinner .
and by morning , when they miss me , I &apos;ll be halfway to Milan .
if they ask me , what will I say ? I ... Anything you like .
Goodbye , Padre . Goodbye , Frederico .
may the Lord bless and preserve you .
what are you carabinieri doing in the yards ?
- Looking for stragglers . - What do you do with them ? send them back to fight invaders .
every foot of Italian soil must be regained .
suppose they don &apos;t want to go back ?
then we shoot them .
- Catherine . - Who &apos;s that ? Shh !
- What are you doing back here ? - Where &apos;s Catherine ?
I know . you &apos;ve run away .
you &apos;re a deserter .
- Where is she ?
I &apos;ve got to see her . - You can &apos;t . she &apos;s gone .
- And you &apos;d better get out . - Has she been transferred ?
- If you don &apos;t get out of here , I &apos;ll scream and bring the whole hospital down on you .
- Why &apos;d she go . where ?
tell me . - No !
- Tell me where she is ! - Go ahead , choke me , but I won &apos;t tell you . you &apos;ve done her enough harm .
- What do you mean ?
- I said you &apos;d get her into trouble . I hate you .
hate , you understand ? I won &apos;t tell you anything . Shh !
I hope they catch you .
I hope they shoot you ! pay you back for what you &apos;ve done to her .
making her have a baby . - Baby ?
- I warned you , but you didn &apos;t care .
- Now she &apos;s had to go away .
- Where ? where ? Oh , for pity &apos;s sake , tell me !
Fergy ! no , no ! no !
- We &apos;re coming , too ! - Be careful , girls . where is he ?
and get me some clothes . a full outfit .
I can &apos;t go around in this uniform .
as long as I don &apos;t get mixed up in it myself . you won &apos;t .
I just want you to get some things , and put an advertisement in the newspaper for me .
I really oughtn &apos;t to , if I had any sense .
I know I shall have awful gas pains in the morning as a result of this .
just say ... &quot; Catherine , where are you ?
&quot; I am free at last .
&quot; meet me at the Palace Hotel , Stresa . &quot; signed &quot; Frederic . &quot;
the Major made an obituary speech in your memory and the Priest ,
- he wanted to say mass for your soul . - But what ...
vermouth . one for you ? uh , two vermouth .
you see , we all thought you were dead .
it never occurred to us that you might have be shell-shocked , wandered away , lost your memory .
how did you find me ?
I saw your advertisement in the paper .
but as soon as we knew , we arranged everything .
Rinaldi will work on you one of his miraculous cures .
you will go back a hero .
I &apos;m not going back . they will decorate you for bravery . they will even promote you .
no . I &apos;m through with the war .
get that straight . but you cannot do that ! you cannot just stop and say , &quot; I &apos;m through with the war . &quot;
- They will not let you do that . - Two vermouth . Hmm .
can I speak to you a moment , sir ?
- It &apos;s all right , Harry , he &apos;s my friend . - But I , uh ...
he keeps telling me that it &apos;s dangerous for me to stay here any longer .
the policeman was in tonight . he spoke of notifying the carabinieri .
- When will they come ?
- Tonight , tomorrow , who knows ?
but soon . my boat is still ready , sir .
if they arrest you , no one can save you .
- I know that . - They will shoot you . look ...
get this through your head , I &apos;m not going back !
I &apos;ve got to wait here until I can find Catherine .
and how do you expect to do that ?
I &apos;ve got some people looking for her .
- If that is more important than ...
- She &apos;s going to have a baby .
my baby .
so ...
and that means everything to you .
Yes , it would .
it means that I &apos;ve got to find her and get her out of Italy .
- Perhaps she &apos;s no longer in Italy .
- What makes you say that ?
she is in Switzerland . where ?
- Brissago . - Brissago ?
Harry !
will you do one for me , too ? Yes , madam .
step around here . no .
just the head , please .
isn &apos;t there any mail for me , yet ?
Ah , madam ! Yes , yes . today there are letters .
- Many letters . - Many ? Oh !
well , that was worth waiting for ... Oh ...
it is up the lake and across . - About 35 kilometres .
- I &apos;ll make it .
at the frontier , there will be sentries . - I know .
- And you will have to watch out - for patrol boats . - I will .
- If it blows too hard , you ... - I won &apos;t drown .
have you enough money ? here .
won &apos;t you need it ?
there must be a Villa Rossa in Pordenone .
always the same girls until they become like old friends .
like war comrades . take it , baby , please . please .
you &apos;re a good egg , Rinin .
no , I am not a good egg .
I am a fool .
but if I had understood how you felt about her ... Good luck , baby .
Ciao , baby .
- Shall I get a new cylinder , Doctor ?
- It is a new cylinder .
Oh , I wanted so to have this baby and not make any trouble .
and now I &apos;m all done .
all gone to pieces .
she is losing strength fast , Doctor .
there &apos;s no use . I &apos;ll have to operate .
that was lovely ... Frederic , darling .
you mustn &apos;t worry , darling .
I &apos;m not going to die now .
I got past the place where I was going to die .
aren &apos;t you glad ?
of course you are not going to die .
you mustn &apos;t think about it .
- We &apos;re lucky to be on time .
is she going to be all right ?
- Are you the husband ?
- Yes . she kept calling for you all night . it would have been better if you &apos;d been here .
I &apos;m sorry .
is she in danger ? - She &apos;s very weak .
- You don &apos;t suppose I could see her now ? - Later , later . - It won &apos;t be long .
she can &apos;t die .
did you call ?
no , I didn &apos;t say anything .
not yet . - Is she all right ?
- I hope so .
the baby ?
a boy , but he was dead before she ever came in here . Oh ...
but she &apos;ll be all right ?
that &apos;s not in my hands any longer .
better go across the street and get yourself some breakfast .
you look as if you need it . it will be some time before she can see you .
there &apos;s nothing there , dog .
you &apos;ve had children ?
what was it like ?
I beg your pardon ? what did you say ?
nothing . some coffee , please , and a brioche .
it &apos;s in the papers . Italy has won !
thank God it &apos;s over . this is the beginning of the end .
but it will be a long time before they can rebuild what &apos;s been destroyed .
&quot; in the early morning hours of November 4th , &quot; the Austro-Hungarian supreme command accepted by radiogram
&quot; the armistice conditions laid down by the General Badoglio . &quot;
don &apos;t let her die . Oh , God , please don &apos;t let her die .
I &apos;ll do anything for you if you don &apos;t let her die .
you took the baby ... That was all right . but don &apos;t let her die .
please , dear God , don &apos;t let her die .
her husband &apos;s out there . might as well let him in .
I knew he was coming .
you won &apos;t tell him , will you ? tell him what ?
that I &apos;m going to die .
- No , we won &apos;t tell him . - Thank you .
doctor ... Have I long ?
don &apos;t you see ?
I have to know . not long .
let him come in . no , wait .
could I ... Could I have my bag , first ?
Oh ! such a mess .
he never liked me to be pale .
you can go in now .
- Catherine . - Darling .
- You &apos;re all right ?
- I &apos;m fine . did you worry about me ?
I came as soon as I found where you were .
poor darling . let me look at you .
Tut-tut . you &apos;re wet and tired .
sit down , darling . here ...
you &apos;re going to be all right , Catherine .
do you want me to do anything , Cat ?
- Can I get you anything ? - No .
just talk to me .
tell me you haven &apos;t stopped loving me . you know I couldn &apos;t stop .
I like to hear you say it , though .
I &apos;ll never stop loving you . never ?
not even if I died ?
never .
you &apos;d never do our things with any other girl , or say the same things , would you ?
never . I want you to have other girls , though .
try ... Try to sleep , Cat .
when I get well , we &apos;ll ...
we &apos;ll take a little house in the mountains .
we always planned a house of our own , remember ? I &apos;ll get you a fine house .
we &apos;ll live in it until the war is over .
then you &apos;ll go back to America and be a splendid architect .
we &apos;ll be married all over again . in a church .
in a church .
Oh , darling !
I don &apos;t wanna die .
- Don &apos;t let me die . - Cat ! take me in your arms , hold me tight .
- Don &apos;t let me go . - Catherine . it &apos;s dark out there , and lonely .
I don &apos;t wanna leave you any more . I &apos;ve been alone so much .
you ... You can &apos;t die . you &apos;re too brave to die .
you &apos;re a fine girl . a brave girl . Yes .
I am a brave girl .
whatever happens , do not be afraid .
I &apos;ll not be afraid .
we &apos;ve never been apart .
not since we met .
not since we met . and never can be .
- Never parted .
- In life and in death .
say it , Cat .
in life and in death , we &apos;ll never be parted . you do believe that , don &apos;t you , Cat ?
I believe it .
and I &apos;m not afraid .
peace ...
- Hello .
grand Hotel .
- The line is busy .
who is this ?
I can connect you with room service .
Hello .
is that the clinic ?
this is Senf , the head porter , Grand Hotel .
how &apos;s my wife ?
is she in pain ?
isn &apos;t the child coming soon ?
patience ?
would you have patience ?
this is Otto Kringelein .
is that you , Heinrich ?
listen .
I &apos;ve got to talk very quickly .
every minute costs 2 marks 90 .
you know that will I made before I had my operation ?
I want you to tear it up .
I came to Berlin to see a great specialist about that old trouble of mine , you know ?
it &apos;s pretty bad , and he says I haven &apos;t long to live .
I say , he says I won &apos;t live much longer !
no , it isn &apos;t nice to be told things like that .
you plague , bother , and save , and all of a sudden you &apos;re dead .
I want to get something out of life .
I &apos;m never going back to Friedersdorf .
never .
I &apos;m staying here at the Grand Hotel .
it &apos;s the most expensive hotel in Berlin .
all the best people stay here .
even our big boss , Preysing , is staying here .
I &apos;m going to tell him someday just exactly what I think of him .
Hello , miss .
this is General Director Preysing .
I want my home in Friedersdorf , please .
hurry .
Hello .
is that you , Mama ?
how are the children ?
what news have you from the factory , dear ?
is your papa there ?
good .
Hello , Papa , is that you ?
the conference with the Saxonia company is set for tomorrow morning , Papa .
if the merger does not go through , we are in very bad shape , Papa .
everything depends upon news from Manchester .
if the deal with the Manchester Cotton Company does not go through ... we &apos;re facing a very bad situation , Papa .
I &apos;m Suzette , Mme. Grusinskaya &apos;s maid .
Madame will not dance today .
she will not go to the rehearsal .
she did not sleep all night .
there is something preying on her mind .
I gave her a tablet , a Veronal .
she &apos;s sleeping now .
this is Baron von Geigern .
look here , I need money , or I can &apos;t stay at this hotel much longer .
I &apos;ve laid the groundwork .
I know the exact position of her room .
I &apos;ve made friends with her ballet master , Pimenov .
listen , Heinrich .
I &apos;ve taken all my savings , everything ... and I &apos;m going to enjoy spending it .
all of it .
it &apos;s terribly expensive here , Heinrich .
but it &apos;s wonderful .
I can &apos;t !
I &apos;ll lose my job .
it &apos;s like being in jail .
rely on me , Papa .
I will make this merger go through .
I never fail .
poor Madame .
her mind is tortured .
I &apos;m afraid she will ....
I don &apos;t need advice , thanks very much .
I need money !
music all the time .
it &apos;s wonderful .
grand Hotel .
people coming , going .
nothing ever happens .
Mme. Grusinskaya will not want her car .
Mme. Grusinskaya &apos;s car is not to be brought .
- Here .
- Yes , Baron ?
- Adolphus is very vexed with you .
- Yes , Baron ?
you didn &apos;t take him for his walk this morning .
- Your door was locked .
- You might have knocked .
don &apos;t you realize ?
that &apos;s why they don &apos;t like little dogs in big hotels .
the doors are locked .
they can &apos;t get out .
you see ?
- Yes , Baron .
- I want you to take him for a good walk .
- You understand ?
- Yes , Baron .
- Don &apos;t bring him back till he &apos;s exhausted .
- No , Baron .
wait a minute .
it &apos;s quite all right .
- Hello ?
- Is that for me ?
no .
Mme. Grusinskaya &apos;s car is to be brought .
Mme. Grusinskaya &apos;s car is to be brought .
good evening .
will you send this to Mme. Grusinskaya ?
- Yes , Baron .
- Thanks very much .
good evening .
my key , 168 .
- Good evening , Mr. Pimenov .
- Good evening , Baron .
- How is the beautiful lady ?
- Grusinskaya ?
to tell the truth , Baron , tonight we &apos;re a little bit nervous .
were you at the theater last night ?
I &apos;m always there when Grusinskaya dances .
- Last night was not so good .
- I thought she was splendid .
is Mr. Preysing in ?
I &apos;m Dr. Zinnowitz .
- Mr. Preysing .
visitor .
- Mr. Preysing .
- Here you are .
- Sorry to have kept you waiting .
waiting ?
I &apos;ve been waiting for news from Manchester .
- No news yet ?
- No news .
that &apos;s bad .
you can &apos;t hold out unless you merge with the Saxonia company .
- I know .
- The Saxonia company will never sign ... unless your firm is tied up with the Manchester people .
they don &apos;t have to .
I told you that .
Yes , I know .
I &apos;m very much worried .
but I have my agent in Manchester .
I &apos;m expecting a telegram any minute .
you have to create a good impression .
seem optimistic .
don &apos;t even mention Manchester to the Saxonia crowd .
be clever .
no , I cannot do that , Dr. Zinnowitz .
I &apos;m used to making my deals on a solid basis .
I &apos;m an honest businessman , a good husband and a father .
I have nothing to conceal .
I could not live happily otherwise .
Yes , I know .
we &apos;ll go someplace and talk it over .
I &apos;m expecting a stenographer .
send her to Mr. Preysing &apos;s room . 166 .
Yes , Dr. Zinnowitz .
- Letters for me ?
- No , Doctor .
- Telegrams ?
- No , Doctor .
he always seems to be waiting for something ... but it never happens .
- No messages ?
- No , Doctor .
Yes , I was in the war .
- Your bill , Baron .
- You &apos;re not beginning that again , are you ?
please pay some attention to me .
I &apos;ve no time .
kindly wait one moment , sir .
- Has anyone asked for me ?
- No , Doctor .
we &apos;re holding the rooms now .
five bedrooms , two sitting rooms .
- How many in your party ?
- Let me see .
my mother , two sisters ...
- Really , this is an imposition .
- Sir , kindly wait one moment , please .
- That makes nine .
- Yes , madam .
- You wish to have the rooms held ?
- Yes , please .
and then ...
really , I won &apos;t wait any longer .
I &apos;ve been here a very long time .
that &apos;s all right .
look here , I waited three days before I got a room at all .
when I finally got one , what kind of a room was it ?
- A very nice room , and inexpensive .
- I didn &apos;t ask you for a cheap room .
when I came here to live , did I ask you for a cheap room ?
did I ?
- If you wait one moment , sir ...
- I can &apos;t wait .
every day is precious .
every hour ...
- 176 ?
- ... every minute is precious .
I came to live here for two weeks , maybe three .
heaven only knows .
I can pay whatever you want .
I &apos;m tired and ill .
I can &apos;t wait .
- The gentleman has a complaint ?
- He is dissatisfied with Room 559 .
Yes , I have a complaint .
I think it &apos;s a perfectly fair complaint .
I came here from a great distance to live at the Grand Hotel .
I want a room , a big room .
the same kind of room you &apos;d give General Director Preysing .
I &apos;m as good as Mr. Preysing .
I can pay for a room the same as Mr. Preysing .
would you stick him way off in a corner in a little room ... where the water pipes go &quot; pop &quot; all day ?
he can have my room .
it doesn &apos;t matter where I stay .
that won &apos;t be necessary , Doctor .
Mr. Kringelein will take Room 176 .
it &apos;s one of our most expensive rooms .
a large room on the front , and with a bar .
- With a private bar , exclusively mine .
- Certainly , sir .
exactly what I want .
that &apos;s very kind .
I &apos;ll pay for it now .
- No , I beg of you , sir .
- Pardon me , sir .
you dropped your little hat .
- Permit me .
- Thank you .
permit me . my name is Kringelein , from Friedersdorf .
- Yes .
I &apos;m Baron von Geigern .
- A Baron .
permit me to present Dr. Otternschlag .
a doctor .
doctor , I &apos;m ill .
I know .
when a man &apos;s collar is an inch too big for him , I know he &apos;s ill .
I must go and dress now .
- I hope to see you at the theater .
- Surely , sir .
- Is this gentleman a baron , too ?
- Unfortunately , no .
- Will Mr. Kringelein kindly sign here ?
- I have signed once .
- Have you a minute ?
- I told you not to come into the lobby .
time &apos;s getting short .
haven &apos;t I told you not talk to me with a cigarette in your mouth ?
- I want to speak ...
- Later .
Yes , sir .
this way , Mr. Kringelein .
Mr. Preysing .
- Will you go up to 166 ?
- 166 .
Hey , wait a minute !
Hello ?
Mme. Grusinskaya &apos;s car is not to be brought .
she said , &quot; On the other side of the fence . &quot;
Baron , you &apos;re incorrigible .
poor Grusinskaya .
- How can she receive anyone ?
she can &apos;t .
- No , of course not .
theater , hotels , trains .
trains , hotels , theater .
- Quite so .
- I must toddle along .
- She &apos;ll be waking up and calling for me .
- I &apos;m sorry , old fellow .
who are you , please ?
I &apos;m the stenographer .
then you will please wait outside , please .
Yes , sir .
outside , please .
take your time .
listen , the burial fund and everything . I &apos;ve got it right here .
I &apos;m going to live .
I &apos;m going to have a good time while I can .
that &apos;s my creed , Kringelein :
a short life and a gay one .
a short life , Baron , and a gay one .
that &apos;s very true in my case .
you know , I know you won &apos;t think I &apos;m impertinent ... but perhaps you might have a little better time ... if you bought some new clothes .
started out fresh , so to speak .
well , Baron , I didn &apos;t think there was time for that .
but it &apos;s very kind of you to take an interest .
- Friends , then .
- Friends , Baron ?
thank you .
- Your room is ready , sir .
- Thank you .
I may speak to the Baron anytime I see him ?
of course , Kringelein .
why not ?
I mean , when you &apos;re with your smart friends ?
- I haven &apos;t any friends , Kringelein .
- You said me , Baron .
- Friend .
- Bless you , Kringelein .
see you later .
I &apos;ve often wondered what would happen to that porter ... if somebody jumped on him from here .
I &apos;m sure I don &apos;t know .
why don &apos;t you try it and find out ?
- Thanks very much .
- Not at all .
- Don &apos;t you like dancing ?
- No .
not with strangers .
- Never ?
- Never .
- Thanks very much .
- Not at all .
- I say ....
- Are you back again ?
he must be an awful nice fellow .
- Who ?
- Whoever &apos;s keeping you waiting .
have you seen it ?
- Seen what ?
- It .
you don &apos;t mean 166 ?
that fat , bulbous neighbor of mine , Mister ....
- Preysing .
- Not you .
Oh , no .
work .
- Does he sing ?
- I hope not .
- Weren &apos;t you playing something ?
- Yes .
the typewriter .
- You &apos;re a little stenographess .
- Yes , I &apos;m a little stenographess .
that &apos;s fascinating .
I don &apos;t suppose you &apos;d take some dictation from me sometime , would you ?
- How about some tea , then ?
- Tea would spoil my dinner .
I only have one meal a day , and I &apos;d rather hate to spoil it .
- Are you reducing ?
- Reducing ?
me ?
do I need to ?
no .
it &apos;s perfect .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ve ever ....
but why one meal a day ?
- Money .
ever heard of it ?
- Yes , I have , vaguely .
but I always thought little stenographers made little pennies .
- Very little .
- That &apos;s too bad .
did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on ?
I have , indeed .
one she &apos;d bought herself ?
I see what you mean . poor kid .
- I wish I were free tonight .
- Aren &apos;t you ?
- What ?
- Free .
no , darn it , I &apos;m not .
but there &apos;s tomorrow .
- What time tomorrow ?
- 5 : 00 , downstairs .
where downstairs ?
in the funny yellow room where they dance .
you &apos;re funny .
- Tomorrow ?
- Of course .
really ?
we &apos;ll dance ?
all right .
we &apos;ll dance .
I wonder if I could remind the Baron of his promise ... that I might speak to him at any time ?
Mr. Kringelein , how are you making out in the royal suite ?
- Wonderfully , thanks to the Baron .
- Baron ?
- Are you a baron ?
- Strangely enough , yes .
- Then this isn &apos;t the Baroness ?
- Strangely enough , no .
- Do I look like a baroness ?
- You &apos;re attractive enough to be anything .
thank you , Baron .
you &apos;re nice .
- Thank you , Miss ....
- Miss Flaemm .
- Miss Flaemm , this is Mr. Kringelein .
- Hello .
- They call me Flaemmchen .
- I like that better .
I wonder if the Baron would take the trouble to come to my beautiful room ?
I &apos;ve ordered some caviar and champagne .
it &apos;s very expensive , but that doesn &apos;t matter .
perhaps Miss Flaemm would join us .
have caviar , if you like , but it tastes like herring to me .
it does , as a matter of fact .
I hadn &apos;t thought of that .
I &apos;m sure my beautiful room ... will appeal to your artistic sense .
it has real velvet upholstery .
A-number one .
I &apos;m in the textile trade , and I know .
I wonder if you &apos;d like to see my bathroom ?
it has hot and cold running water all day .
Nighttime , too .
I can have a bath anytime that I like .
- No .
- Yes .
stenographer .
please .
her master &apos;s voice .
Goodbye , Mr. Kringelein .
thank you .
Goodbye , funny one .
don &apos;t forget tomorrow . 5 : 00 .
- I won &apos;t . Goodbye , you .
- Goodbye .
- What &apos;s the matter , Mr. Kringelein ?
- Preysing .
- You know him , don &apos;t you ?
- I know him ?
I &apos;ve slaved in that man &apos;s factory for years and years .
I know him through and through .
- Sorry , old man .
- I beg your pardon , Baron .
excuse me .
won &apos;t you join me in my room ?
I &apos;ve ordered some champagne .
listen , I &apos;d love to .
I &apos;ll join you a little later .
you know the gentleman we met downstairs , with the face ?
- Who ?
the doctor , you mean ?
- Yes .
- He &apos;s a gay old blade , isn &apos;t he ?
- He &apos;s wonderful .
please , Messieurs , Madame is asleep .
see you later .
- Waiter !
- Please .
sorry .
has Madame slept well ?
no , I &apos;ve been awake , thinking .
it is time for the performance .
I think , Suzette ...
I &apos;ve never been so tired in my life .
not even the Veronal can help me to sleep .
Mme. Grusinskaya &apos;s car is to be brought .
- I can &apos;t dance tonight .
- It will pass , Madame .
pearls are cold .
everything is cold and finished .
so far away .
so threadbare .
the Russians .
saint Petersburg .
Imperial court .
the Grand Duke Sergei ....
Sergei ... is dead .
it &apos;s all gone .
Mon Dieu .
the pearls , if they were to break ....
the pearls don &apos;t break .
they hold together and bring me bad luck .
I hate them .
orchids again , Madame !
no card .
I think they are perhaps from the same young man .
he is at the end of the corridor .
tall . he walks like a soldier .
Madame must have noticed how often he rides in the elevator with us .
Yes ?
oui .
- Madame , the car is here .
- Send it away .
I shan &apos;t need it .
Mme. Grusinskaya will not require her car .
no .
she &apos;ll not be going to the theater .
- Time for the performance .
- The performance .
poor little Lisebeta .
she still has her stage fright .
it will pass .
- It &apos;s not stage fright .
it &apos;s something more .
- What ? what is it ?
- Last night there was no applause .
- There was .
that theater , half empty .
dancing for those few .
I was frantic .
I finished , I waited , I listened ... but the applause did not come .
they &apos;re past , Pimenov . they &apos;re dead .
it &apos;s finished .
Meierheim .
Madame !
in negligée an hour before the performance .
what &apos;s this , you &apos;re canceling your car ?
do you know the time , or are we all mad ?
am I your manager ?
have we contracts ?
have we obligations ?
- Is this the time , or I am blind ?
- I &apos;m canceling the engagement .
Madame is canceling the engagement ?
Madame has chosen a funny time for such a funny joke .
tonight there is a line in front of the theater since 6 : 00 .
the house is jammed to the roof .
- Is it really full ?
- Doesn &apos;t Meierheim say so ?
packed to the ceiling .
and such an audience :
the French ambassador , American millionaires , Princess Retski ...
all right .
- Hurry , Suzette .
- We &apos;ll wait outside .
poor child .
- How is the house ?
- Terrible .
after this , no more ballets for me .
jazz .
just jazz .
if the house is empty again ....
I don &apos;t know .
when she gets her paint on , hears the music , she &apos;ll be fine .
I know these people .
here she is .
why did you bring the pearls ?
I said I won &apos;t wear them .
- Why not ?
- Take them back .
- Hurry up .
- We haven &apos;t time .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ll be able to join you fellows after all .
- Why not ? we &apos;ll wait .
- Come on .
- Lift , please .
- Wait .
can I help ?
you go ahead , old man .
I &apos;ll be there if I &apos;m up for it .
- We &apos;ll meet anyway .
- All right .
Mme. Grusinskaya &apos;s car .
Mme. Grusinskaya &apos;s car is to be brought .
the car is here , Madame .
Hello .
fifth floor .
good evening .
it &apos;s just 9 : 30 , madam .
Yes .
I &apos;ll send them up at once .
- Is he in ?
- The Baron ?
- Yes .
- Yes .
Adolphus , I have something very serious to discuss with you .
when you meet lady dogs on the street that are not dachshunds ... you must exercise some self-control .
we have company .
you &apos;re late .
the dancer &apos;s gone to the theater .
excuse me , I &apos;m busy .
this is a very peculiar thing for one gentleman to say to another ... but as a matter of fact ... you &apos;re the one thing in the world I really love .
she &apos;s gone to the theater .
don &apos;t you know ?
- What are you going to do ?
- The pearls are in her room .
the others are getting suspicious .
I had Amsterdam on the phone .
they think you &apos;re scared .
I &apos;ve been careful .
I &apos;m waiting my chance .
waiting your chance ?
you &apos;re too much of a gentleman , that &apos;s the trouble .
I told you I &apos;d get those pearls tonight , didn &apos;t I ?
- Need any help ?
- No .
have you got the skeleton key ?
- No .
- Why not ?
one reason : there &apos;s a perfectly charming floor clerk outside who sees everything .
she &apos;d see me enter her room .
- I can take care of her .
- How ?
chloroform on a handkerchief while you &apos;re on the job .
- No .
- Why not ?
poor kid . in the first place , it would give her a rotten headache .
I know all about chloroform .
I had it in the war .
besides , she &apos;s rather pretty .
- She has a very nice line ...
- You &apos;re no good for this business .
- No ?
- To you it &apos;s just a joke .
I don &apos;t like your tone .
- No ?
- No .
get out .
leave her to me .
be ready to leave on the night train for Amsterdam .
- With the pearls .
- With the pearls .
get out .
there is a nasty man , Adolphus .
he &apos;d eat his young .
&quot; both parties have fully agreed that this merger can only result ...
&quot; in mutual advantages .
&quot; Moreover .... &quot;
- Did you get that ?
- Yes , I got it .
what did you say Zinnowitz called you ?
Flaemmchen .
- Flaemm ?
that &apos;s odd .
- What ?
I mean , who were the gentlemen you were talking to in the corridor ?
some people I know .
- You know a lot of gentlemen , don &apos;t you ?
- Oh , not many .
I haven &apos;t time .
I &apos;m busy now looking for a job .
I &apos;d love to be in the movies .
why the movies particularly ?
I mean ....
&quot; ... only in mutual advantages .
Moreover .... &quot;
you &apos;re a very unusual stenographer .
you &apos;re pretty enough to do other things .
- I do .
- What ?
you see , I have a rather nice figure , and I pose a lot .
art studies , you know ?
like that ?
I got 10 marks for it .
is that you ?
you ?
well , isn &apos;t that interesting ?
- That &apos;s lovely .
- &quot; Moreover .... &quot;
&quot; Moreover , the possibility of the successful accommodation ...
&quot; for the Cotton Company ...
&quot; should throw a great weight into the balance .... &quot;
&quot; balance . &quot;
your hands are sunburned , aren &apos;t they ?
- Yes , that &apos;s from skiing .
- From skiing ?
a friend of mine took me to Switzerland last month .
to Switzerland ?
that must have been very nice .
I went to Florence once , too .
- With the same man ?
- No .
don &apos;t misunderstand me , Miss Flaemm .
I &apos;m a married man and have grown-up daughters ...
- All right .
- ... bigger than you are .
come in .
that &apos;s all .
excuse me , please .
&quot; deal with Manchester definitely off . &quot; is that something terrible ?
it doesn &apos;t mean that at all .
- That &apos;s a mistake .
that &apos;s wrong .
- All right . I &apos;m sorry .
- Do you want to go on ?
- No .
you come back in the morning ... and we will go on with the dictation before the conference .
if you find out you won &apos;t need me in the morning ...
I wish you &apos;d please let me know ... because men like you who come in and out of town are often unreliable .
after all , if I don &apos;t work tomorrow ....
well , good night .
&quot; deal definitely off . &quot;
why , we could be smashed .
I &apos;m going into 170 now , madam .
Hello ?
no .
there &apos;s no one here .
you &apos;re late .
what have you been doing ?
everyone says , &quot; Come back . &quot; they won &apos;t get out of their rooms .
housekeeper speaking .
no , she isn &apos;t here .
- Western Theater ?
- Have you seen Madame ?
Hello .
Mr. Pimenov ?
have you found her ?
no , she isn &apos;t here .
Yes , I know ...
Pimenov ?
what &apos;s happening ?
no , I haven &apos;t found her .
who &apos;s dancing ?
Duprez ?
how was it ?
good .
all right .
you keep the show going .
this trick is going to cost Madame a suit for breach of contract .
- Madame is ill .
her nerves ...
- What about my nerves ?
who is she ?
where does she think she is , Russia ?
- I want to be alone .
- Where have you been ?
I suppose I can cancel the Vienna contract .
I just want to be alone .
you &apos;re going to be very much alone , my dear Madame .
this is the end .
- Shall I ....
does Madame wish ....
- No , Suzette .
all right .
Western Theater , please .
Mr. Pimenov , the ballet master .
Grusinskaya .
Hello , Pimenov .
I &apos;m at the hotel .
I couldn &apos;t go on .
I couldn &apos;t .
how is it going ?
who &apos;s dancing ?
Duprez ?
well , how is it ?
I see .
they didn &apos;t miss me at all .
good night , Pimenov .
they didn &apos;t even miss me .
Yes .
I &apos;m sorry .
I &apos;ve finished .
finished .
I always said I &apos;d leave off when the time came .
and who would trouble about a Grusinskaya ... who dances no more ?
what would she do ?
grow orchids ?
keep white peacocks ?
die .
that &apos;s what it comes to at last : to die .
I &apos;m not going to wait .
don &apos;t be alarmed , Madame .
who are you ?
someone who happened to be hiding in your room .
why ?
I often come here when you &apos;re at the theater .
why ?
just to be alone in your room , to breathe the air you breathe .
there &apos;s no need to call for help .
permit me . I couldn &apos;t help hearing .
I couldn &apos;t help knowing what you were about to do just now .
I could have left by the window , unnoticed , but I risked being discovered .
may I say something , Madame ?
you &apos;re so beautiful .
it tore my heart to see you in despair like that .
what on earth have they been doing to you ?
you &apos;ve everything to live for .
please don &apos;t cry anymore .
you must forgive me .
I &apos;ve had a very trying evening .
I was so alone , and suddenly you were there .
why do you look at me like that ?
I had no idea you were so beautiful .
I &apos;d like to take you in my arms and not let anything happen to you , ever .
how tired you are .
Yes , tired .
and alone ?
so alone .
you mustn &apos;t talk Russian to me .
strange man .
am I so strange to you ?
maybe not so strange now .
you know , once , when the Grand Duke was alive ...
I found a man hiding in my room , a young officer .
later on , they found him dead .
well , that was Russia .
- Who are you ?
- Someone who can love you , that &apos;s all .
someone who has forgotten everything else but you .
you could love me ?
I &apos;ve never seen anything in my life as beautiful as you are .
you must go now .
I &apos;m not going .
you know I &apos;m not going .
please let me stay .
but I want to be alone .
that isn &apos;t true .
you don &apos;t want to be alone .
you were in despair just now .
I can &apos;t leave you now .
you mustn &apos;t cry anymore .
you must forget .
let me stay .
just for a little while .
please let me stay .
for just a minute , then .
no , Doctor .
the champagne , and those girls and their dancing ... those beautiful silver things , and the ice , and the caviar ....
Oh , Doctor .
I don &apos;t care .
it &apos;s life .
life .
Mr. Kringelein , you are drunk .
- Good night .
- Good night .
- No . my room .
- Yes , Doctor .
Mr. Kringelein , you &apos;re drunk .
life .
grand Hotel .
Hello ?
grand Hotel .
grand Hotel , good morning .
Baron von Geigern &apos;s room does not answer .
Yes , all right .
Baron von Geigern &apos;s chauffeur calling ?
grand Hotel , good morning .
930 , Dr. Otternschlag .
no , Doctor .
no messages .
grand Hotel , 820 .
grand Hotel , good morning .
who is calling Mme. Grusinskaya ?
Mr. Pimenov .
Mme. Grusinskaya cannot be disturbed .
Mr. Preysing &apos;s calls to 162 for the day .
- 162 . - The conference room .
that is interesting .
a man in the textile industry must know Manchester .
there &apos;s a lot of business to be done with the Manchester Cotton Company .
they have the whole English market right in their hands .
have you any connections with Manchester ?
we have a lot of good connections in England .
- Actually ...
- I mean , with the Manchester people .
please , we are here to discuss the merger .
let us begin at the beginning .
- Yes .
- Thank you .
is Baron von Geigern in ?
too bad .
since June 11 this year , when the first negotiation ...
I met him yesterday .
... between our respective firms ...
I &apos;ve got a date .
... that this merger can result ....
about 5 : 00 .
- ... all of us .
- Dancing .
- All we want to know about is Manchester .
- Just a second .
before I get through , I &apos;m laying before you here ... the last general statement of the concern .
the capital , the plant , the machinery ....
for instance , we &apos;ll take mop rags .
- I &apos;ll call you back .
- All we want to know about is Manchester .
Yes , Mr. Preysing , that &apos;s what we want to know .
I would rather wait for Justice Zinnowitz ... before I commit myself , please .
now , to go ahead with the merger .
you realize ... that this merger is a great advantage to the Saxonians , of course .
now , let &apos;s talk like adults .
- When you first approached us ...
- We did not approach you .
this letter filed on September 15 indicates you approached us .
that letter is a response to a tentative feeler sent out by you .
- Please . - Tentative , my foot !
a month before this , your old father-in-law ...
- comes to me privately , and scratches ...
- Scratched ?
- Why , we did not take the initiative !
- You did ...
- We did not take the initiative !
- You took the initiative !
gentlemen , I see the conference has already begun .
- I &apos;m glad you &apos;re here , Justice Zinnowitz .
- Good morning .
- Thank you very much .
- I beg your pardon , please .
excuse me , please .
I am glad you &apos;re here .
these gentlemen have cross words .
would you try , Justice Zinnowitz ...
- and iron out the situation here ?
- Certainly .
- Right here , on the top . - If you will allow me .
thank you .
well , gentlemen , the situation seems to be perfectly clear .
- Yes .
and how clear is Manchester ?
- Manchester ?
have you said anything about Manchester , Mr. Preysing ?
why , no , sir .
I cannot commit myself at this time about Manchester .
quite right .
well , gentlemen , since June 11 of this year ... when the first negotiations for a merger were entered ...
now we &apos;re going to begin at the beginning again .
as you remember it , when you approached us ...
- We did not approach you .
- I &apos;m sorry , you did approach us !
we did not approach you .
- You approached us !
- Please wait .
can you imagine 100 girls in a ballet school ... each thinking she would become the most famous dancer in the world ?
I was ambitious then .
we were drilled like little soldiers .
no rest , no stopping .
I was little , slim , but hard as a diamond .
then I became famous soon .
but why am I telling you all this ?
last night I didn &apos;t know you at all .
- Who are you , really ?
- What ?
I don &apos;t even know your name .
I am Felix Benvenuto Frihern von Geigern .
my mother called me Flix .
no .
Flix .
that &apos;s sweet .
and how do you live ?
what kind of person are you ?
I &apos;m a prodigal son , the black sheep of a white flock .
I shall die on the gallows .
- Really ?
- Really .
I haven &apos;t a bit of character .
none at all .
- No ? - No .
really .
you know , when I was a little boy I was taught to ride and be a gentleman .
then at school , to pray and lie .
and then in the war , to kill and hide .
that &apos;s all .
and what do you do now ?
now I &apos;m a gambler ... running at large , like a happy pig ... devouring everything of life that pleases me .
I really belong in jail .
what a picture .
and what else ?
what else ?
I &apos;m also a criminal and a hotel thief .
that &apos;s not a funny joke .
you must believe one thing .
you must believe that I love you .
that I &apos;ve never known love like this until now .
what is it , Flix ?
what &apos;s the matter ?
hotel thief .
no .
did you come here just for these ?
that &apos;s horrible .
you may keep the pearls .
I don &apos;t want them .
I will not denounce you .
hadn &apos;t you better go now ?
I wanted money desperately .
can &apos;t you understand that ?
that &apos;s why I wanted your pearls .
I was threatened .
I was desperately in need of a certain big sum of money .
I &apos;ve been following you .
I &apos;ve admired you .
but last night , at last , I managed to come into your room .
and now ....
and now ?
I couldn &apos;t go through with it .
don &apos;t you understand ?
don &apos;t you ?
- Who ?
- Suzette , Madame .
- Good morning .
- Good morning , Madame .
- Did Madame sleep well ?
- Yes , Suzette .
come back in five minutes .
I &apos;ll call you .
five minutes .
there , it begins .
Hello , Pimenov .
good morning .
darling .
beautiful morning .
Yes , very well .
rehearsals ?
all right , you can come .
Goodbye .
I have to go to rehearsals .
our train leaves early tomorrow morning .
- Our train ?
- Yes , for Vienna .
- Vienna ?
- You &apos;re coming with me .
- Of course you are .
- But I can &apos;t .
I &apos;d give my soul to go , but I can &apos;t .
- Why couldn &apos;t you ?
- I &apos;ll try .
there might be some way .
- Flix , is it money ?
- Of course .
I have money .
I have enough for both of us .
no .
that would spoil everything .
I &apos;ll manage somehow . I &apos;ll get it .
I have a whole day .
I &apos;ll be on the train .
I shall dance , and you &apos;ll be with me .
then we &apos;ll go to Tremezzo .
I have a villa there .
the sun will shine .
I &apos;ll take a vacation , six weeks , eight weeks .
I don &apos;t know .
we &apos;ll be happy and lazy .
and then we &apos;ll go to South America .
it will be divine .
- Be careful going to your room .
- I &apos;ll be on the train with the money .
don &apos;t do anything foolish .
- I &apos;m alarmed about you .
- Don &apos;t worry .
I &apos;ll be on the train .
hurry , Suzette .
a bright dress .
it &apos;s a sunny morning .
Meierheim is canceling the Vienna engagement .
Meierheim is mad .
you are mad .
we &apos;re all mad .
Suzette , come .
Gru , you &apos;re positively radiant .
Pimenov , I have an idea , a ballet .
it must have mad music ....
but I &apos;ll speak with you later .
you go to the theater .
I want a full rehearsal , ballet , full orchestra ....
- Come , Suzette .
- But , Madame ....
will you get me Baron von Geigern , please ?
Yes .
Baron von Geigern .
chéri , it &apos;s you .
no , nothing .
good morning .
no .
just to tell you that I &apos;m happy .
I &apos;ll have something sweet and cold , please .
- Louisiana Flip , sir ?
- Louisiana Flip ?
Yes , that sounds very nice .
thank you .
what do you do in the Grand Hotel ?
eat , sleep , loaf around ... flirt a little , dance a little .
a hundred doors leading to one hall .
no one knows anything about the person next to them .
and when you leave , someone occupies your room ... lies in your bed .
that &apos;s the end .
let me say again , for the tenth time ... you people were quite ready for the merger .
you declared yourself fully agreed on all the terms .
why should the signing of these articles be suddenly held up ?
I &apos;ll admit that we were at one time anxious for this merger .
but since then , the Preysing Company has fallen on evil days .
- Evil days ?
- Very evil days .
say , listen .
haven &apos;t I just shown you here ... what my firm exports to the Balkans ?
50,000 marks worth of mop rags each and every year .
mop rags .
we &apos;re interested in something entirely different .
- What ?
- Shall I tell them again ?
why waste time ?
it &apos;s getting late .
- You see ...
- We &apos;re going home .
but Mr. Preysing has too great a regard for the certainty ...
you &apos;ve been talking all day .
you &apos;re hoarse now .
good night , Preysing .
you have decided against the merger ?
- Yes .
- The deal is off ?
Yes .
- Here &apos;s your coat , sir .
- Thank you .
- Here , let me help you .
- Thank you .
Preysing , I hope you pull through .
it &apos;s a very bad time to be in such a crisis .
sorry .
- Dining in town ?
- No , I have to get my train .
here !
so you &apos;re breaking off the negotiations .
all right .
but don &apos;t you think for one moment that I &apos;m such a fool ... as not to have something to say about Manchester .
what ?
Manchester ?
no .
the deal is over .
good night , gentlemen .
if you have something definite to say about Manchester , we might ...
I &apos;m at liberty to announce at this time that the deal between my firm ... and the Manchester Cotton Company ... has been successfully negotiated .
are you joking ?
under those circumstances ....
- Where are those articles ?
- I thought it was all over .
under these circumstances , it &apos;s a different matter .
Yes , but under these circumstances we might refuse to sign now .
now , come , come .
business is business .
now , I &apos;ll sign in here .
Preysing , you sign here .
we should celebrate this with a bottle of wine .
good night .
we &apos;ll see you next week and settle all the details .
- Next week .
Yes .
- Come on .
good night , Preysing .
you &apos;re a sly one .
- Dr. Waitz ?
- Yes .
I &apos;ll be at your office tomorrow .
you let me talk myself hoarse ... and you had Manchester signed up all the time .
why ?
- The deal has been put through .
- Yeah .
the deal has been put through .
- What &apos;s the matter with you ?
- Here .
&quot; deal with Manchester definitely ...
&quot; definitely off . &quot; Preysing !
Yes , if that &apos;s what the world wants , bluff ...
I can be just as big a bluff as anyone .
you must go to England yourself at once and really see this through !
Yes , I must go to England .
I was desperate .
I didn &apos;t know what I was doing .
now I don &apos;t care .
this thing goes to a man &apos;s head .
- What you need is some relaxation .
- Yeah !
that &apos;s it !
I want to break loose .
I want to drink .
I want to maybe go dancing .
I want to do anything .
I can understand that , after this ....
Yes , go on , say it .
my lie .
but that &apos;s the first time in 30 years that ....
where is my stenographer ?
Miss Flaemm ?
- What do you want with her ?
- Pardon ?
- What do you want ?
- What ?
here .
I want to do some dictating .
I want to tell my father-in-law about ...
she had an engagement in the Yellow Room at 5 : 00 .
she was in a hurry .
- In the Yellow Room ?
- Yes .
do you think that she &apos;s pretty ?
- Pretty as a picture .
- You think so ?
let &apos;s go find her .
we &apos;ll go get a drink .
- You come along , Zinnowitz .
- Yes .
I don &apos;t know much about women .
I &apos;ve been married for 28 years , you know .
come along , Zinnowitz .
- Good evening , Mr. Kringelein .
- Good evening , Miss Flaemm .
- Have you seen the Baron ?
- I &apos;m waiting for him .
I &apos;ve been with him all day .
we had a marvelous time .
we were in a motor car , 100 miles an hour , in an airplane .
- Really ?
- We had a marvelous time .
my , how you &apos;ve changed .
you look awfully nice .
thank you , Miss Flaemm .
I had a manicure , too .
really ?
I &apos;m sorry , Miss Flaemm .
would you have something to drink ?
a Louisiana Flip .
Louisiana Flip , please .
- Absinthe .
- Oh , that .
- You like music , Mr. Kringelein ?
- Yes .
I love it .
it &apos;s so stimulating .
- A man could ...
- A man could what ?
- He could do almost anything .
- He could .
- Hello , funny one .
- Hello .
- Sorry I &apos;m late .
- Baron , won &apos;t you have a drink ?
- A Louisiana Flip .
- Mr. Kringelein , how are you now ?
I feel a little strange , Baron .
- I &apos;d given you up .
- Sorry .
please , Baron , do have a drink .
a Louisiana Flip .
no , thanks , old man .
I &apos;m keeping my head clear .
- Dance , then ?
- What ?
- Dance ?
- Yes , I &apos;d love to .
- Watch this , will you , Mr. Kringelein ?
- I really ought to learn to dance .
I suppose it &apos;s very important .
Yes , you should learn as quickly as the time allows .
believe me , Mr. Kringelein , a man who is not with a woman ... is a dead man .
- What have you been doing all day ?
- Chasing around .
- Chasing what ?
- Money .
- You were very different yesterday .
- That was yesterday .
I served as a surgeon in the Great War ... till the end .
grenade in my face .
I carried diphtheria bacilli in the wound till 1920 .
Isolated two years .
- Drink , Mr. Kringelein .
- Yes .
that was lovely .
listen , funny one , do you want to make a man happy ?
- I &apos;d love to .
- Dance with old Kringelein .
why ?
I don &apos;t know .
he &apos;s a dear old duck .
I feel rather sorry for him , don &apos;t you ?
you know , you &apos;re not a bit like you were yesterday .
yesterday ?
no , perhaps not .
I fell in love last night .
the real thing .
there &apos;s no real thing .
it just doesn &apos;t exist .
I thought that , too .
but now I know that it does .
it &apos;s wonderful .
come along .
- Dance with old Kringelein ?
- Of course .
anything for you .
you &apos;re sweet .
here you are .
I must speak with you .
- Presently , Mr. Preysing .
- No , now . this is very urgent .
this lady has urgent business with me at the moment .
insolence .
Berlin manners .
good evening , Mr. Preysing .
you &apos;re staying here , too ?
- I &apos;m sorry , but I cannot place you .
- Kringelein , at the plant .
one of our agents .
no .
assistant bookkeeper , Room 23 , Building C , third floor .
- I am away , sick . - That &apos;s very interesting .
good day .
would you like to dance with me , Mr. Kringelein ?
Miss Flaemm , I &apos;ve never danced in public .
- Come along and try it .
- I &apos;d be afraid .
there &apos;s nothing to be afraid of .
you &apos;ll love it .
Miss Flaemmchen , I must speak to you .
this is about a dictating job .
- When do we start ?
tomorrow morning ?
- No , right now .
we were just going to dance .
do you know each other ?
Mr. Kringelein , Mr. Preysing .
Mr. Kringelein would be a good friend and not accept your invitation to dance .
I couldn &apos;t think of not accepting the invitation to dance .
I understood you to say that you reported to our plant ill ... and you &apos;re here in Berlin indulging in diversions ... which are very much beyond your means ?
this is very extraordinary , Mr. Kringelein .
I think we should look over your books .
come along now , children .
no fighting .
save that for the office .
does the world belong to you , Mr. Preysing ?
haven &apos;t I got any right to live ?
I will wait 10 minutes for you .
if you &apos;re not back , it will be necessary to engage someone else .
what happened to your dance ?
we &apos;re going now , thank you , Baron .
come along .
I shall remember this , Mr. Kringelein .
let the poor devil alone .
death &apos;s staring him in the face .
I did not ask your advice .
I think you &apos;d better go away .
we will see who will remain here the longer .
Baron von Geigern , please .
Mr. Kringelein , you must look at my face , and not the floor .
Yes .
- Why , you &apos;re trembling .
- I never danced in public before .
- You dance beautifully .
- Thank you .
- That &apos;s right .
- I &apos;m happy , Miss Flaemm .
are you really ?
for the first time in my life , I &apos;m happy .
are you all right ?
Yes .
excuse me , I just stopped a second .
all right .
here we go .
I &apos;m very tired .
do you mind if we stop ?
thank you .
- I must go back to Mr. Preysing now .
- Must you ?
Yes , business .
one has to earn a living , you know .
not you , Miss Flaemm .
just another desk slave .
money .
- I &apos;m glad you &apos;re here , Miss Flaemm .
- Here I am .
- Did you enjoy your dance ?
- Yes , thank you .
- Excuse me .
go away , please .
- Where &apos;s the Louisiana Flip ?
- Would you like a little cognac ?
- Yes .
you wanted to see me ?
Yes .
you may go , Mr. Kringelein .
Mr. Preysing , I am not taking orders from you here .
what is this insolence ?
please go away .
you think you have free license to be insulting ?
believe me , you have not .
you think you &apos;re superior , but you &apos;re quite an ordinary man ... even if you did marry money ... and people like me have got to slave for you ... for 320 marks a month .
- Go away , please .
you are annoying .
- You don &apos;t like to see me enjoying myself .
when a man &apos;s working himself to death , that &apos;s what he &apos;s paid for .
you don &apos;t care if a man can live on his wages or not .
you have a very regular scale of wages , and there &apos;s the sick fund for you .
what a scale , and what a fund .
when I was sick for four weeks ... you wrote me a letter telling me I &apos;d be discharged ... if I were sick any longer .
did you write me that letter or not ?
I have no idea of the letters that I write .
I know that you are here in the Grand Hotel , living like a lord .
you are probably an embezzler .
- An embezzler !
- Yes , an embezzler .
you are going to take that back !
right here in the presence of this young lady !
who do you think you &apos;re talking to ?
you think I &apos;m dirt ?
if I &apos;m dirt , you &apos;re a lot dirtier ...
Mr. Industrial Magnate Preysing !
- You &apos;re discharged .
get out !
- You can &apos;t do that to him .
I don &apos;t know the man or what he wants .
I never saw him before .
I know you .
I &apos;ve kept your books for you , and I know all about you .
if one of your employees was half as stupid in a small way ...
- as you are in a big way ...
- What do you mean ?
gentlemen , please !
please !
stop that !
- You &apos;re discharged !
do you hear ?
- Wait !
you can &apos;t discharge me .
I &apos;m my own master ... for the first time in my life .
you can &apos;t discharge me .
I &apos;m sick .
I &apos;m going to die .
you understand ?
I &apos;m going to die , and nobody can do anything to me anymore .
nothing can happen to me anymore .
before I can be discharged , I &apos;ll be dead !
the man &apos;s crazy .
I don &apos;t know him .
he &apos;s annoying .
- Baron !
- Excuse me .
- What is it ?
what &apos;s happened to him ?
- He &apos;s ill .
- I &apos;m sorry , Baron .
- Poor old Kringelein .
you &apos;re all right .
- Give him some whiskey .
- No .
a Louisiana Flip .
five minutes to 7 : 00 .
time drags when you &apos;re tired .
I was in the hospital the whole night , walking up and down the corridor .
they wouldn &apos;t let me see her .
and I have to stay chained to this desk .
did you find that young lady for Mr. Preysing ?
- His secretary .
Yes , they &apos;re over there .
- That &apos;s all .
his secretary .
come on , waiter .
- Would you like a little cognac ?
- No , nothing .
nothing ?
- One cognac for me .
- Very good , sir .
you wanted to see me ?
Yes .
pardon me .
I must go to England .
it &apos;s very important .
I must go at once .
I have some very big deals ... involving hundreds of thousands of marks ... and I thought I would take along a secretary ... to take care of my correspondence .
you know what I mean .
I understood you to say that you traveled and ....
you understand ?
I understand you perfectly , Mr. Preysing .
what would you want for such a trip ?
- Marks ?
you mean money ?
- Yes .
I don &apos;t know .
I &apos;d have to figure it up .
I &apos;d need clothes and shoes ... and it &apos;s cold in England in March .
- You &apos;d want me to look nice ?
- Of course , Miss Flaemm .
Yes , I thought you would .
I should say 1,000 marks .
- Is that too much ?
- No .
that is all right .
would you like me to get you a room here ... at the hotel ?
now ?
- And that would ...
- Hello , Baron .
- Would you please pay some attention ?
- I &apos;m paying attention .
- How do you do ?
- Insolence .
you mean the Baron ?
- Baron what ?
- What ?
he &apos;s a gentleman .
is the Baron tired ?
no , not tired exactly .
I thought this evening we could go to the casino .
that place we passed with the wonderful bright lights .
Kringelein , I &apos;d adore it .
I can &apos;t go anywhere .
- What ?
- I &apos;m broke .
- No , you &apos;re joking .
- Yes .
isn &apos;t it odd ?
a baron , broke .
excuse me , old man .
- I quit .
- You can &apos;t .
I &apos;m not getting those pearls , neither are you .
- What about the money ?
- I &apos;ll pay you back .
- How ?
- I have an idea working in my head .
you might find a bullet through that head .
if you do that you &apos;ll get nothing , except maybe the police after you .
Mme. Grusinskaya &apos;s car !
if you wait , I &apos;ll pay you back your 5,000 ...
I &apos;ll see you later .
go on , Suzette .
are you coming to the theater ?
I shall dance tonight .
how I shall dance !
I want to feel that you &apos;re there .
I came too far .
- I &apos;m worried about you .
- Don &apos;t be .
- You &apos;ll be on the train ?
- Yes .
- Until then .
- Bless you .
- Was the Baron joking ?
- What ?
- Is it really true ?
- What are you talking about , Kringelein ?
is the Baron really in financial straits ?
to tell you the truth , I must get some money somehow right away .
- If the Baron will permit me .
- What ?
I &apos;d be awfully glad to oblige .
you &apos;ve been very decent to me .
three hundred ?
if I could get into a game of some kind , I think I might win .
gambling !
I &apos;d love that !
I &apos;ve got over 6,800 marks right here .
if we could scare up some men to play .
- We could go up to my room .
- That &apos;s a grand idea .
come on .
- Cab , miss ?
- What ?
- Cab ?
- No , thanks .
I &apos;ll walk .
- 4,000 marks .
- 4,000 !
too high ?
4,000 marks .
- Want a card ?
- Please .
thanks .
- 8,000 marks .
- 8,000 !
- I take it all .
- That &apos;s a lot of money .
I need it , thanks .
- Want a card ?
- Please .
baccarat .
too bad there .
- Now , Mr. Kringelein .
- Baron !
will you help me again , please ?
I think you &apos;d better help me , Kringelein .
- Make your bets , gentlemen .
- How much shall I bet ?
- How much is left in the bank ?
- 2,500 uncovered .
- Do you feel like going that far ?
- All that money , Baron ?
come on , you &apos;re killing them tonight .
go ahead , old man .
do you want a card ?
what have you got ?
the old highwayman .
he has nine again .
I win again !
come on , gentlemen .
please drink !
drink .
it &apos;s wonderful and sweet champagne !
Mr. Kringelein , care to take the bank ?
Yes !
surely .
I &apos;ll take everything .
I &apos;ll take anything .
come on , now .
drink , gentlemen .
please drink some champagne .
it &apos;s expensive and good .
what will I take the bank for ?
- I &apos;ll play for 500 .
- Baron , all at once ?
suppose you lose it ?
it &apos;s all the same thing , Kringelein .
come on , now , old man .
deal me two cards .
one to me first .
one to yourself .
one to me .
one to yourself .
Baron , if all that money ....
what have you got ?
I &apos;ve got a nine !
isn &apos;t that a wonderful thing ?
Kringelein , you old robber , you &apos;re hopeless .
Baron !
Baron , please .
it &apos;s no use , old man .
it &apos;s sweet of you ...
- but you have all the luck .
- It &apos;s true .
I have luck , for the first time in my life !
I have luck !
Baron , are you out ?
have you finished playing ?
Yes , thank you .
I &apos;ll recover again presently , in 10 or 20 years .
look , Doctor .
I &apos;ve won again !
there you are .
Baron , I win and drink , and drink and win !
gentlemen , please don &apos;t go .
be my guests . don &apos;t go .
I beg your pardon .
I know I oughtn &apos;t to presume , but I &apos;m so grateful to you .
it &apos;s been so marvelous .
for the first time in my life , I &apos;ve gambled and I &apos;ve danced .
you gentlemen can laugh ... but for the first time in my life , I &apos;ve tasted life !
- Splendid !
- Life is wonderful , but it &apos;s very dangerous .
if you have the courage to live it , it &apos;s marvelous .
- Wonderful !
- You don &apos;t know about that .
you &apos;re healthy and happy .
but I , believe me ... if a man doesn &apos;t know death , he doesn &apos;t know life .
- It &apos;s a short life , but a gay one .
- Please , gentlemen , don &apos;t go .
come on .
drink to life ... to the magnificent , dangerous ... brief , wonderful life .
- Kringelein !
- And the courage to live it .
you know , I &apos;ve only lived since last night ... but that little while seems longer than all the time that &apos;s gone before .
all of ....
take him over to his bed .
turn him around .
how is he , Doctor ?
- It will be over in a minute .
- Over ?
- It &apos;s only just begun .
- Quiet , Kringelein .
don &apos;t be afraid .
I &apos;m not afraid , Doc .
- I &apos;m not afraid to die .
- There , there .
you &apos;ll be all right .
too much iced champagne .
- What ?
- Hello , Baron .
Hello , Kringelein .
you old drunkard .
it &apos;s late .
- What is it ?
- My pocketbook .
I &apos;ve lost my pocketbook .
14,000 marks in that pocketbook .
- I &apos;ve got to find it .
- No , stay where you are .
no , I &apos;ve got to find that .
- Kringelein !
- 14,000 marks .
14,000 marks were in that pocketbook .
I can &apos;t see anything .
you don &apos;t know what that money means to a man like me .
you &apos;ve never lived like a dog in a hole ... and scrimped and saved .
you did not see his pocketbook , did you , Baron ?
no .
my life hangs on that money , Baron .
nobody ever gives you anything for nothing .
you have to buy everything , and pay cash for it .
I wanted to pay for my last days with that money .
I must find it !
I haven &apos;t anything in the world but that pocketbook !
every hour costs money .
I must find it !
here &apos;s your pocketbook , you silly old thing .
- There &apos;s your money .
- You found it !
that &apos;s it .
you found it .
I &apos;m very glad he got it back . 14,000 marks .
Yes .
it &apos;s a lot of money , isn &apos;t it ?
- Good night , Kringelein .
- Don &apos;t go , Baron .
don &apos;t leave me .
- I must , old man .
it &apos;s late , I &apos;m sorry . - No .
please don &apos;t go !
I must , old man .
it &apos;s late .
good night .
good night , Kringelein .
stay a while , Baron .
I &apos;m sorry .
I can &apos;t , old man .
I have no time .
wait a minute .
- Hello , funny one .
- Hello .
what are you doing here at this time ?
looking for my room . 164 .
- Do you live here ?
- Yes , for tonight .
such is life , Flaemmchen .
you &apos;re nice .
good night ... funny one .
good night .
come on .
- Thank you , madam .
good night .
- Good night .
you were superb tonight .
what a success !
Yes .
it was a triumph , wasn &apos;t it ?
Madame will return to Berlin soon ?
who knows , monsieur ?
do be sensible .
shall I come and talk about the music now , or not ?
no .
not tonight .
Pimenov , go and find him .
- Flaemmchen .
- Hello .
I &apos;ve been waiting in there for you .
I had to arrange about the trip .
- You &apos;re very sweet .
- Thank you .
won &apos;t you sit down ?
you know , you are entirely different from what I expected .
- Different ?
how ?
- I don &apos;t know .
I thought you were more of a coquette ... not so ladylike .
what did you expect ?
wouldn &apos;t you like to call me by the first name ?
no , I couldn &apos;t do that .
- Why not ?
- I don &apos;t know .
one can &apos;t get intimate just offhand .
I could go to England with you and all that , but ....
I always say that nothing should be left hanging over .
and names are like that .
supposing I met you next year and I said :
&quot; how do you do , Mr. Preysing . &quot;
and you said , &quot; That &apos;s the young lady who was my secretary in Manchester . &quot;
that &apos;s all quite proper .
but supposing I saw you and yelled :
&quot; Hi , baby !
remember Manchester ? &quot;
and you were with your wife .
how would you like that ?
we will leave my wife out of this , Flaemmchen , please .
- Sorry .
- I didn &apos;t mean that .
you are very slender , aren &apos;t you ?
- Think so ?
- Are you going to be nice to me ?
Yes .
- Very nice ?
- That &apos;s what you expect , isn &apos;t it ?
you like me just a little bit , don &apos;t you ?
you &apos;re still a stranger to me , but that doesn &apos;t matter .
it &apos;s you , Baron .
what are you doing in this room here ?
- This your room , Preysing ?
- Yes , this is my room .
sorry .
I must &apos;ve made a mistake .
we shall see whether you made a mistake or not .
that door is locked , Baron .
Yes .
I came through here .
here .
I want that pocketbook .
- What do you mean ?
- I want that pocketbook .
give it to me !
- Certainly .
- So that &apos;s how we stand , Baron .
look here , Preysing ...
I &apos;m completely at your mercy .
I was desperate .
it &apos;s a matter of life and death .
I had to get some money tonight , somehow .
Yes , you did have to get some money tonight ... but you &apos;re going to jail .
you &apos;re going to be locked up .
- Why , you &apos;re a thief !
- Be quiet .
quiet ?
Yeah , quiet !
you danced with Flaemmchen when I wanted to transact business with her .
you , the nice friend of the nice Mr. Kringelein .
- Do you want to wake up the entire hotel ?
- I will wake up the hotel !
I &apos;ll show them what a baron you are .
you are a thief !
I &apos;ll have you locked up .
here , you wait here .
thief !
you !
strike me , would you ?
Hello .
operator .
operator .
they &apos;re having a nice little game up there with that telephone .
Oh , God .
Baron !
speak to me !
Baron .
he tried to rob me .
he &apos;s a thief .
here , Miss Flaemm .
Miss Flaemm , please don &apos;t leave me .
please , Miss Flaemm .
- Look !
- What a grand hotel !
- Hurry up .
they &apos;re waiting .
- She was in a hurry .
no wonder she was running .
Mr. Kringelein !
wake up !
hear me ?
wake up !
- The Baron .
- The Baron ?
go quickly .
the Baron .
do you hear me ?
- Where ?
- Preysing &apos;s room .
hurry !
here . take it .
you thief , you .
I must get out of here .
Mr. Kringelein , he robbed me .
he struck me .
he &apos;s dead .
Baron .
dead , just like that .
look .
his eyes are still open .
he looks so peaceful .
it can &apos;t be so hard to die .
that pocketbook he stole from me .
it &apos;s just like it was .
I haven &apos;t touched nothing .
maybe he did try to take your pocketbook ... but you don &apos;t kill a man for that .
you don &apos;t kill a man about a pocketbook .
poor Baron , he wanted money so badly .
- Where is Miss Flaemm ?
- I &apos;ll take care of her .
that &apos;s it .
she &apos;s working with that man .
she enticed me into her room while he robbed me here .
- I &apos;ll tell that to the court .
- To the court ?
Yes .
Mr. Kringelein , I must talk with you before the police come .
Miss Flaemm is in your room ?
- Yes .
- She &apos;s in your room .
no one will know that I was with her .
you were with her .
they will not interrogate you .
they will not ask you any questions .
you cannot give no testimony .
neither can she say anything .
but what you are proposing is falsification of the evidence .
my existence is hanging by a thread .
a scandal with that woman would mean ruin for me .
- But you &apos;ve just killed a man !
- That makes no difference !
I beg your pardon .
it makes all the difference in the world .
- We &apos;re going to call the police .
- No !
please , Mr. Kringelein .
I will give you money , anything .
you can go away .
please .
- I have enough money .
- Mr. Kringelein , please help me .
- My life is in your hands .
- Your life .
what about my life , when you had it in your hands ?
but I can send you back to Friedersdorf .
I can give you a very good position in Friedersdorf .
many , many thanks , Mr. Industrial Magnate Preysing ...
- but I am never going back to Friedersdorf .
- Don &apos;t , please .
worry about yourself .
don &apos;t worry about me .
no , Mr. Kringelein , please don &apos;t call ...
Hello !
there &apos;s been a murder here .
I don &apos;t understand you .
murder ?
- They &apos;re drinking .
- What ?
Yes .
what is it ?
is this a joke ?
Hello .
hurry up .
someone in 166 says there &apos;s been a murder .
166 ?
Preysing ?
I &apos;ll attend to it .
- What time is it , Suzette ?
- It &apos;s 3 : 00 in the morning , Madame .
tired , Suzette ?
- Is Madame not tired ?
- No , Suzette .
- Madame has changed her dress again .
- Yes , Suzette .
the music has stopped .
how quiet it is tonight .
it was never so quiet in the Grand Hotel .
those flowers make me think of funerals .
- Don &apos;t they you , Suzette ?
- It &apos;s just nerves , Madame , nerves .
Suzette , we &apos;re going to take a holiday soon .
six weeks in Tremezzo .
I &apos;m going to live like a real woman ... perfectly simple , perfectly quiet , perfectly happy .
- Yes , Madame .
- We &apos;ll have a guest .
certainly , Madame .
but Madame must sleep now .
the train will soon go .
I suppose so .
call Baron von Geigern &apos;s room , please .
keep ringing .
he must be asleep .
come and fetch me , chéri ...
I &apos;m longing for you .
I haven &apos;t been asleep .
I kept thinking that you might come to me .
but he must answer .
ring !
why don &apos;t you answer the phone , please ?
Yes .
Yes .
ring .
where are you ?
Thirty-four !
Thirty-six .
Thirty-eight .
Forty .
- Forty-two .
- Let &apos;s go to work , boys .
Forty-four .
Forty-four , forty-six pounds .
Forty-eight .
- Are these things necessary ?
- I &apos;m afraid so , Mr. Preysing .
all right .
we &apos;ve taken care of all that , Mr. Preysing .
the night porter &apos;s gone .
you &apos;re late .
I was at the clinic the whole night .
- My wife , poor girl .
- The child hasn &apos;t come yet ?
no .
but I mustn &apos;t let it interfere with my duty .
- You won &apos;t forget that ?
- No , sir .
- I &apos;m going now .
- Yes , Doctor .
- What &apos;s this ?
- A killing in 166 .
killing ?
who ?
the big manufacturer Preysing killed Baron von Geigern .
good heavens !
what for ?
- I don &apos;t know .
- That &apos;s terrible !
- He was a nice fellow .
- They say he was a thief .
I don &apos;t believe it .
he was a real gentleman .
I know people .
I &apos;m so tired I can &apos;t hardly see out of my eyes .
no sleep for two nights , here all day , and now this killing at the hotel .
Halt !
front !
- Good morning .
- Good morning .
show your hands .
hands .
over .
- Change those gloves .
- Yes , sir .
- Down .
- Dismissed .
too bad about the Baron .
you always felt better when he came along .
- Always friendly , such an agreeable fellow .
- I &apos;ll tell you a funny thing about ...
be quiet .
good morning , madam .
where are you taking that dog ?
- Baron von Geigern .
- Give it to me .
better take charge of this dog .
it belonged to the Baron .
Yes , sir .
- They have taken him away ? - Yes .
wasn &apos;t it terrible ?
Madame must not know .
you understand ?
Madame must not know !
all right , I can tell it to the maids , but I can &apos;t answer for downstairs .
- Are you all right , Miss Flaemmchen ?
- Yes .
I was just thinking about the Baron .
lying there , with his eyes so open .
you loved the Baron , didn &apos;t you ?
so did I .
he was friendly to me as no man ever was .
what if he was a burglar ?
- They don &apos;t kill a man for that .
- He was desperate .
he was ?
he tried to raise money all day .
and he laughed , poor devil .
and a man like Preysing has to kill him .
you know , I didn &apos;t like Preysing right off .
why did you have anything to do with him ?
- Money .
- Money .
- You don &apos;t understand that , do you ?
- Yes , I do .
- Do you really ?
- Yes , I do .
I could take care of you , Miss Flaemmchen , if you &apos;d let me .
I have enough money .
there &apos;s 10,200 marks in this pocketbook ... and there &apos;s 3,400 that I won last night .
that would last a long time .
I could win some more .
we could travel .
- Travel ?
- Yes , to Paris .
- I &apos;ve always wanted to go to Paris .
- Anywhere you like . here .
I &apos;ll give you this money I won last night . 3,400 ...
- and then later you can have some more .
- Later ?
Yes , when I ....
I &apos;m ill , Flaemmchen .
I won &apos;t live long .
will you stay with me ?
that &apos;s nonsense !
we &apos;ll find a great doctor .
he &apos;ll cure you .
- They can cure anything these days .
- You think so ?
of course .
you &apos;ll see . here .
do you think you &apos;d have as good a time with me ... as you did with Preysing ?
- Why , of course .
- Really ?
- Yes .
- You like me better than you did him ?
you &apos;re a good man , Mr. Kringelein .
a very good man .
you know , I never thought anything so beautiful could come to me .
we &apos;ll catch the first train to Paris .
order two tickets now .
come on .
I can &apos;t .
Hello , porter ?
Yes , please .
I &apos;d like two tickets to Paris .
Yes .
what time does the next train leave ?
Pimenov .
- He &apos;ll be on the train .
- But how do you know ?
Baron von Geigern has left ?
when ?
how long ago ?
the Baron left about half an hour ago .
Gru , come , come . we &apos;ll lose the train .
come along .
here you are , sir .
I &apos;m sorry .
Mme. Grusinskaya &apos;s car .
come along , the train will be going .
- What is it , Gru ?
- Please come , madam , please .
- I &apos;ll ask myself .
- What is the use of asking ?
- He &apos;ll be on the train .
he &apos;ll be there .
- Have you seen Baron von Geigern ?
the Baron is not here , madam .
- Has he gone ?
- Yes , madam .
- We haven &apos;t any time to waste .
- He &apos;ll be on the train .
we have a rehearsal in Vienna tomorrow .
the sun .
it &apos;ll be sunny in Tremezzo .
we &apos;ll have a guest , Suzette .
Yes ?
grand Hotel !
the Grand Hotel , sweetheart .
this way , precious .
take the car to the garage .
take the bags in , please .
come , darling .
good morning .
- Will you kindly register ?
- Certainly .
- Mr. and Mrs. Hoffman .
- Head porter &apos;s desk .
Mr. Senf ?
just a moment .
hospital .
Hello .
Yes , head porter .
Yes .
what ?
- Yes .
- What &apos;s the matter ?
the child has come .
it &apos;s a boy .
- And your wife ?
- My wife is well .
Hello .
hospital ?
I &apos;ll be with you on lunch hour .
these rooms are not taken .
176 , 170 , 168 , 166 .
- Is Your Excellency leaving ?
- A cab , please .
- A cab for His Excellency .
- My bill , and the lady &apos;s , too .

trying to teach me a lesson in patience , Sir Joseph ?
method is everything in archaeology .
we always deal with our finds of the day in order .
well , it seems to me that that box we dug up today , with the very peculiar gentleman over there , is the only find we &apos;ve made in two months that &apos;ll bring this expedition medals from the British Museum .
we didn &apos;t come to dig in Egypt for medals .
much more is learned from bits of broken pottery than from all the sensational finds .
our job is to increase the sum of human knowledge of the past , not to satisfy our own curiosity .
Oh , that &apos;s all very true , Sir Joseph , but , after all , we &apos;re human .
- And a find like this !
how can you wait ?
- This is your first trip .
I &apos;ve been here ten years .
I &apos;m more curious about the mummy than you .
and even more about that box .
- Whemple .
- Yes ?
the viscera were not removed .
the usual scar made by the embalmer &apos;s knife is not there .
I guessed as much , Muller .
I had a good look at him when I photographed him .
never saw a mummy like that .
neither , I imagine , has anyone else .
looks as though he died in some sensationally unpleasant manner .
the contorted muscles show that he struggled in the bandages .
buried alive ?
&quot; Imhotep &quot; .
&quot; high Priest of the Temple of the Sun at Karnak &quot; .
poor old fella . now , what could you have done to make &apos; em treat you like that ?
an execution for treason , I suppose .
sacrilege , more likely .
look . sacred spells which protect the soul in its journey to the underworld have been chipped off the coffin .
so Imhotep was sentenced to death not only in this world , but in the next .
maybe he got too gay with the vestal virgins in the temple .
possibly . the priestesses of the Temple of Karnak were daughters of the Pharaoh .
they were the secret virgins of Isis .
maybe the answer &apos;s in that box we found buried with him .
I see I shall get no more work out of you until after it &apos;s open .
- Come on .
- Let &apos;s have the box .
Oh dear .
the wood &apos;s so rotten it &apos;ll fall apart at a touch .
whatever it is , it &apos;s terribly heavy .
metal . looks like copper .
it &apos;s gold .
I say . look here .
the unbroken seals of the Pharaoh Amenophis .
some temple treasure .
&quot; death , eternal punishment , for ...
anyone ... who ... opens ... this ... casket . &quot;
&quot; in the name of Amon-Ra , the king of the gods . &quot;
good heavens , what a terrible curse !
- Well , let &apos;s see what &apos;s inside !
- Wait !
you will break the curse .
we recognise your mastery of the occult sciences , Muller .
but your beliefs can &apos;t interfere with my work .
- Then why did you send for me today ?
- As a friend and an expert .
this find was unique and I wanted your opinion .
- It &apos;s providential that you did .
- Oh , come , Dr Muller .
surely a few thousand years in the earth take the mumbo jumbo off any old curse .
Oh , I cannot speak before a boy .
come out under the stars of Egypt .
do not touch that casket .
go on with your cataloguing . we &apos;ll open it later .
don &apos;t think you can persuade me not to examine the most wonderful find of my whole experience out here .
if you are right about the legend , then this casket may contain the Scroll of Thoth , from the holy of holies in the temple , and I can hardly wait to get back to find out .
the gods of Egypt still live in these hills , in their ruined temples .
the ancient spells are weaker , but some of them are still potent .
and I believe that you have in your hut the Scroll of Thoth itself , which contains the great spell with which Isis raised Osiris from the dead .
put it back . bury it where you found it .
you have read the curse . you dare defy it ?
in the interests of science , even if I believed in the curse ,
I &apos;d go on with my work for the museum .
come back with me and we &apos;ll examine this great find together .
I cannot condone an act of sacrilege with my presence .
what &apos;s the matter , man ?
for heaven &apos;s sakes , what is it ?
he ...
he went for a little walk !
you should have seen his face !
here &apos;s something to break the monotony . a visitor coming from the Nile .
- Colour ?
nationality ?
- How could I see in that glare ?
well , Whemple , back we go to London .
and what fools we look .
money wasted . hole after hole dug in this blasted desert .
a few beads . a few broken pots .
a man needs more than hard work for this game .
he needs flair . he needs luck .
like your father .
when he came here , there wasn &apos;t so much competition .
when he did , he found things . and once , ten years ago , he found too much .
was it ten years ?
queer story , that young Oxford chap he had with him going mad .
- You know what I think it was ?
- No . what ?
he went crazy . bored beyond human endurance in this sand and these rocks .
he was laughing when your father found him . he died laughing , in a straitjacket .
your father never explained .
but when the best excavator England has turned out , a man who loved Egypt , said he &apos;d never come back here , that meant something .
come in .
you break your season &apos;s camp , Professor Pearson ?
your colleagues have returned to London ?
Yes . Whemple and I stayed behind to clear up .
your expedition has not been a success .
scarcely . here are the season &apos;s finds .
permit me to present you with the most sensational find since that of Tutankhamen .
this is very sporting of you !
may I ask why ?
we Egyptians are not permitted to dig up our ancient dead .
only ... foreign museums .
what &apos;s this ?
part of the funerary equipment of the princess Anck-es-en-Amon .
- Daughter of Amenophis the Magnificent .
- Yes . it &apos;s her name .
I found that not 100 yards from where we are .
- You mean you think her tomb is there ?
- I will show you where to dig .
I &apos;m sure it &apos;s very good of you , Mr ... ?
I didn &apos;t catch your name .
Ardath Bey .
Circumstantial evidence . not very strong , perhaps .
but if we put that gang of diggers from Kerma on the job , we can tell in two days if there &apos;s anything here .
in one day , Professor .
- It &apos;s a step .
- He was right .
anyhow , we &apos;ve found something .
- The name of Anck-es-en-Amon .
- We will cable your father in London .
he must be here when we examine this great find .
the seal of the seven jackals .
and it &apos;s unbroken .
no one has entered this door since the priests of the royal acropolis sealed it .
3700 years ago .
is there a view like this in all the world , Helen ?
the real Egypt .
are we really in this dreadful modern Cairo ?
your thoughts are far from the dance and these nice English boys .
not really . I &apos;m having a lovely time .
- I &apos;m so grateful .
- But why ?
your keeping me here with you , of course .
so I don &apos;t have to go up to Father in that beastly hot Sudan .
it &apos;s I who am grateful . my most interesting patient .
know who that is ?
- Muller of Vienna .
- Really ?
always spends his winters here . authority on Egyptian occult .
- Yes , but the girl ?
- Helen Grosvenor .
her father &apos;s governor of the Sudan . English , of course . her mother , Egyptian .
some old family with a tree a mile long . she &apos;s staying here with Dr and Mrs Muller .
pardon me , sir . our closing bell has rung .
I did not notice the time .
- I am addressing Sir Joseph Whemple ?
- Yes .
- I am Ardath Bey .
- Indeed !
why , we have you to thank that we have this exhibit here at all .
the museum should be kept open all night in your honour .
won &apos;t you come down to my office ?
I &apos;m working here late .
your pardon . I dislike to be touched .
an Eastern prejudice .
won &apos;t you sit down ?
you know my son ?
Ardath Bey .
where did you disappear to when we opened the tomb ?
I returned to Cairo .
but ... but now I must not detain you .
but I must see you again . you must come to my house .
I regret I am too occupied to accept invitations .
he &apos;s a strange one .
you might have thanked him . he was responsible for finding the princess .
Yes . I rather wish he hadn &apos;t been .
it &apos;s a dirty trick , Cairo Museum keeping what we &apos;ve found .
that was the contract . the British Museum works for science , not for loot .
Anck-es-en-Amon .
Anck-es-en-Amon .
Anck-es-en-Amon .
is anything the matter ?
Anck-es-en-Amon .
Anck-es-en-Amon .
where do you want to go , miss ?
le musée des Antiquités .
le musée des Antiquités .
Imhotep .
Anck-es-en-Amon .
Anck-es-en-Amon .
Imhotep .
Imhotep .
I must get in .
Anck-es-en-Amon .
- I must !
- It &apos;s closed for the night . they &apos;ve gone .
I must get in .
Imhotep .
Imhotep .
Imhotep .
what &apos;s she saying ?
what language is that ?
the language of ancient Egypt . not heard on this earth for 2000 years .
and the name of a man unspoken since before the siege of Troy .
- Is your master at home ?
- Yes , sir .
tell him Dr Muller wishes to see him urgently .
- How did I get here ?
- We brought you here . father and I .
you fainted .
but how did you guess she was here ?
I discovered that she took a taxi from the hotel to the museum .
I went there .
the watchman said she had left in your car .
before you take her away , I must talk to you about something she said just now .
- Oh , Dr Muller .
- Oh , here you are , my dear .
I suppose you introduced yourself ?
no ?
Miss Helen Grosvenor , my old friend Sir Joseph Whemple , Frank Whemple .
that seems so formal under these peculiar circumstances .
and now , if you &apos;re all right again , back we go to the hotel .
I think she &apos;ll want to rest a few minutes .
Frank , will you make yourself agreeable ?
well ...
where was I when I fainted , Mr Whemple ?
- Oh , outside the museum .
- What was I doing there ?
well , I wouldn &apos;t know that , would I ?
no , I don &apos;t suppose you would . I wish I did .
- I was waiting ...
- Let &apos;s not talk about it .
Oh , right .
- You &apos;re partly Egyptian , aren &apos;t you ?
- Yes .
how did you guess that ?
well , I don &apos;t know . just something about you .
I &apos;d have liked Egypt better if I &apos;d met you there .
no such luck !
stuck in the desert for two months , and was it hot !
- That tomb .
- What tomb ?
surely you read about the princess ?
- So you did that ?
- Yes .
the 14 steps down and the unbroken seals were thrilling .
but when we came to handle all her clothes , her jewels and her toilet things ...
they buried everything with them they used in life .
- When we came to unwrap the girl ...
- How could you do that ?
had to ! science , you know !
well , after we &apos;d worked among her things , I felt as if I &apos;d known her .
but when we got the wrappings off , and I saw her face ...
you &apos;ll think me silly , but I sort of fell in love with her .
do you have to open graves to find girls to fall in love with ?
I say . now I know what it is about you .
there was something about her head ...
I had never mentioned the name , yet I heard Miss Grosvenor mutter in ancient Egyptian something about Imhotep .
Imhotep ?
what was this Ardath doing in the museum ?
looking at the mummy . just at closing time .
Hello ?
what ?
il est mort ?
tout de suite , effendi .
come . a museum guard found dead in the room with the princess .
fear .
fear .
so he died of shock .
we find this in dead guard &apos;s hand , Sir Joseph .
probably thief tried to steal it . guard take it away , thief kill him .
the cause of death , I not find nothing .
looks like an attempted theft , but nothing stolen here could be sold .
what is the document ?
let me put this here . you &apos;ll be more comfortable .
thanks .
you really want to know why I didn &apos;t take you to the hospital ?
- Because , when I held you in my arms ...
- Hadn &apos;t you better not commit yourself ?
what girl could not make a conquest who collapsed at a man &apos;s feet in moonlight ?
it seems absurd when we &apos;ve known each other such a short time , but I &apos;m serious .
haven &apos;t I had enough excitement for one evening , without the additional thrill of a strange man making love to me ?
but I &apos;ve never been serious about this sort of thing before .
now , look here . you can tell me to go to the devil , but you can &apos;t laugh at me .
the curse has struck her , and now , through her , it will strike my son .
quiet .
Frank , will you come to your father &apos;s study ?
Helen , I shall take you home presently .
I &apos;ll be back in a minute .
Imhotep was alive when that mummy in the museum was a vestal virgin in the temple .
3700 years ago !
what &apos;s that got to do with us now ?
your assistant who went insane and died , as you might have if you &apos;d seen what he saw , made a transcription of part of that scroll .
Yes . I have it still .
you seem to think it has all the devils of hell in it . burn it and be done with it .
an excellent suggestion .
what became of the mummy of Imhotep ?
somebody stole it !
look , what &apos;s the matter with Miss Grosvenor ? you still think that that mummy was stolen , Sir Joseph ? Yes .
I ...
I really don &apos;t know .
a thousand pardons .
I am Ardath Bey .
I am Helen Grosvenor .
I called to see Sir Joseph .
- He &apos;s in the study .
- In conference ?
if I might perhaps wait ?
Yes .
of course .
have we not met before , Miss Grosvenor ?
no .
I don &apos;t think so .
I don &apos;t think one would forget meeting you , Ardath Bey .
then I am mistaken .
but you are of our blood .
as to that , I am not mistaken .
Yes . my mother was Egyptian .
you must burn the Scroll of Thoth !
I tell you , it &apos;s the museum &apos;s property , not mine .
who &apos;s out there with Miss Grosvenor ?
Ardath Bey !
he &apos;s come for the scroll .
Ardath Bey , Dr Muller .
I accept your invitation . but I find no solitary student with his books .
I fear my visit is inopportune .
on the contrary . we were just talking about ...
- Me ?
- Your native Egypt .
you know Miss Grosvenor ?
Ardath Bey introduced himself .
won &apos;t you be seated ?
sir Joseph was just wondering how you knew where the tomb of the princess Anck-es-en-Amon was hidden .
partly inference , partly chance .
sir Joseph , you seem disturbed .
Yes . a tragedy at the museum after you left .
tragedy ?
when I was there ...
when you were there , Miss Grosvenor ?
Yes . they told me I went there and tried to get in after it was closed .
I don &apos;t remember , but ...
Helen , it is very late .
Frank , will you please see Helen back to the hotel ?
- Certainly , if Miss Grosvenor will let me .
- I don &apos;t want to go .
after what happened , you need rest badly .
but I don &apos;t .
I was tired , but ...
why , I &apos;ve never felt so alive before !
- As your doctor , I must order you to go .
- I &apos;m not a child .
Yes , please come .
then , Ardath Bey , au revoir .
we must see each other again .
I shall be honoured .
an unusual crime . a guard killed by a man who left a gift to the museum .
- A gift ?
- A scroll .
part of which was transcribed when it was first found .
here is the transcription .
I cannot read the writing of a period so remote .
but you read &quot; Anck-es-en-Amon &quot; on that piece of pottery .
that was of the 18th dynasty .
these are pre-dynastic ideographs .
the scroll from which this was copied was stolen ten years ago , together with the mummy of the high priest Imhotep .
most interesting .
may I see that scroll , Sir Joseph ?
we left it at the ... museum .
- So .
- I have something else to show you .
a photograph .
why do you show all this to me ?
do you think it conceivable that the mummy was not stolen , but given a semblance of life by the spell of the scroll ?
that scroll is my property . I bought it from a dealer .
it is here in this house . I presume , in that room .
we had foreseen this .
the scroll is in safe hands .
it will be destroyed the minute it is known that harm has come to us .
you have studied our ancient arts , and you know that you cannot harm me .
you also know that you must return that scroll to me or die .
now tell that weak fool to get that scroll , wherever it is , and hand it to his Nubian servant .
- The Nubian !
- The ancient blood .
so you have made him your slave .
if I could get my hands on you , I &apos;d break your dried flesh to pieces .
but your power is too strong .
this is the evil force that has been attacking her .
burn the scroll , man .
burn it !
it was through you this horror came into existence .
it &apos;s true .
it &apos;s true .
your father destroyed the scroll , knowing that it would cost him his life .
what &apos;s that ?
Isis .
the Egyptian symbol of life . I meant it for your father .
what good could that old charm have done him ?
I tell you , the doctors say it &apos;s plainly heart failure .
the Nubian is missing .
he &apos;s an old servant .
he &apos;s frightened .
he &apos;ll be back .
don &apos;t try and make me believe that this Ardath fellow is a mummy come to life .
that idea , and the horror of it , killed my father .
the museum guard died of natural causes , too .
Frank , I need your help .
I saw your attraction to my patient last night , and hers to you .
- Hers to me ?
do you really think so ?
- And I welcomed it .
but do you think I have a chance ?
Cos I think she &apos;s the most won ...
- Oh , but this is terrible at a time like this ...
- Frank , I &apos;m afraid .
- Will you go with me to her now ?
- Yes .
then telephone her first , not to leave the hotel .
9590 .
no .
I &apos;m not going out .
Yes .
I promise to wait until you get here .
Goodbye .
and I &apos;m so dreadfully sorry .
what were you doing , Doctor ?
your father did not burn the Scroll of Thoth .
that creature has it now .
- The ashes in the fireplace !
- They were newspaper .
the scroll is papyrus .
then it was murder ?
the Nubian !
wear this around your neck .
- Why ?
- When we fight this creature , we must ask protection from the forces of all that it defied .
- I &apos;ll give it to Helen .
she needs protection .
- No , her life is not in danger .
it is her soul .
should love for you come to her , he will try to destroy you .
that amulet , the Egyptians believed , was a charm against evil sendings , such as struck down your father .
your dog is frightened .
my servant will see to him .
sit down , Miss Grosvenor .
ancient Egypt .
nothing modern .
what a strange incense .
is it not familiar to you ?
- No .
- Our forefathers used it .
yours and mine .
you will not remember what I show you now , and yet I shall awaken memories of love and crime and death .
I knelt by the bed of death .
thy father &apos;s last farewell .
I knew the Scroll of Thoth could bring thee back to life .
I dared the god &apos;s anger , and stole it .
I stole back to thy tomb to bring thee back to life .
I murmured the spell that raises the dead .
they broke in upon me and found me doing an unholy thing .
thy father condemned me to the nameless death .
the scroll he ordered buried with me , that no such sacrilege might disgrace Egypt again .
a nameless grave .
the slaves were killed so that none should know .
the soldiers who killed them were also slain , so no friend could creep to the desert with funeral offerings for my condemned spirit .
Anck-es-en-Amon .
my love has lasted longer than the temples of our gods .
no man ever suffered as I did for you .
the rest you may not know .
not until you are about to pass through the great night of terror and triumph , until you are ready to face moments of horror for an eternity of love ,
until I send back your spirit , that has wandered through so many forms and so many ages .
but , before then , Bast must again send forth death .
death to that boy for whom love is creeping into your heart .
love that would keep you from myself .
love that might bring sickness and even death to you .
awake .
have I been asleep ?
I had strange dreams .
dreams of ancient Egypt , I think .
there was someone like you in them .
my pool is sometimes troubled .
one sees strange fantasies in the water . but they pass like dreams .
my dog !
Wolfram !
Wolfram !
where is he ?
Helen .
Helen !
where have you been ?
we &apos;ve been so worried . we &apos;ve hunted everywhere .
- In the museum again ?
- Yes .
Muller &apos;s down in the Arab quarter now .
well , if I must give an explanation , it was stuffy in here .
I can &apos;t be shut up all the time . and I don &apos;t like the feeling I &apos;m always being watched .
- I took the dog with me .
- Where is the dog ?
he &apos;s dead .
- But how ?
- I don &apos;t know .
- Well , where ?
- I don &apos;t remember .
but I can see it now .
standing on poor Wolfram &apos;s back .
- A white cat .
- A white cat ?
the cat-goddess Bast !
Yes , there was a statue of Bast .
the goddess of evil sendings !
just what happened ?
try to remember , Helen !
I don &apos;t want to remember .
besides , I don &apos;t see it &apos;s any affair of yours .
Oh , but it is .
we know that you were with Ardath Bey .
Oh , Helen .
Helen , I love you .
I &apos;m trying to help you and protect you .
we all are .
don &apos;t let me go again . I &apos;ll try to get away , but you mustn &apos;t let me .
no matter what I do or what I say .
there &apos;s death there for me .
and life for something else inside me that isn &apos;t me .
but it &apos;s alive too , and fighting for life .
save me from it , Frank .
save me .
Oh , everything &apos;s going to be all right .
now that you &apos;ve asked for help , I &apos;ll never leave you alone .
I &apos;ll get Mrs Muller down here with you , and I &apos;ll stay here till the doctor comes .
then , we &apos;ll take you to my house .
Oh , Helen .
it &apos;s been such torture .
I love you so .
I don &apos;t like that doctor . please go in there and find out what he &apos;s saying about me .
I will , my dear .
he &apos;ll know just what &apos;s the matter with you and cure you .
now , don &apos;t worry .
now , Miss Farthing , help me to get dressed and get out of here .
- Come over you again , Miss Grosvenor ?
- I must escape .
I &apos;m being held .
help me .
you told me , when these fits came on I wasn &apos;t to listen .
I have a friend . he &apos;s rich . he &apos;ll give you money .
now you just lie down again . you know you mustn &apos;t get up .
if you don &apos;t want money , what do you want most ?
he &apos;ll give you anything , if only you &apos;ll help me to go to him .
do you want me to call Dr Muller ?
- No .
I hate him .
- Mr Whemple , then ?
I &apos;ll die if I don &apos;t get away from him !
- Now , Miss Grosvenor .
- It &apos;s killing me !
now , Helen , you must not do this again .
you &apos;re always so exhausted afterwards .
she &apos;s too weak to be removed except to a hospital .
I insist on keeping her here under our direct observation .
but , Doctor , you haven &apos;t told us what to do . she gets weaker every day .
you know that negligée I bought in Paris ? help me to put it on .
and bring me my toilet things . I want some colour . I want to look well .
you can &apos;t , my dear .
they &apos;d never allow it .
- The nurse would be sure ...
- I know .
we &apos;ll get rid of her .
this is a plot , just between us . I want to look the way I did .
just a surprise , for Frank .
and I want you to bring him to me . you understand ?
in short , I have failed to make a diagnosis .
medical science is helpless in a case like this .
Frank .
go to her , and don &apos;t be angry with me . I couldn &apos;t resist her .
Helen , you shouldn &apos;t have done this . they shouldn &apos;t have let you .
just this once .
perhaps the last time .
but you &apos;re going to get well .
then I know I can make you love me .
I know I can make you happy .
I do love you , Frank .
and I &apos;m trying to prove it , because I &apos;d rather die than live and lose you .
but you &apos;re going to live . we &apos;re not going to lose each other .
- So , my dear . you ...
- Don &apos;t scold me .
just feminine vanity . I wanted to look my best again .
so you know more than I realised you knew .
- What do you mean ?
- These impulses to go to him .
the pull is too strong to withstand and live .
I am so glad you understand .
Helen knows .
she knows the moment she stops struggling , he will give her back her strength to come to him .
but I don &apos;t want to lose my own mind and be someone else . someone I hate .
my dear , while you were growing worse , we tried to find him and failed .
the next time the call comes , go to him .
Muller , what can we do now ?
we can do no more . Ardath has beaten me .
the next time he draws her to him , we must follow her .
- And then ?
- We will destroy him .
I &apos;ve given her some bromide . she &apos;s asleep now . I &apos;ll go to bed .
- All right .
I &apos;ll wait till Dr Muller comes .
- Good night .
good night .
where are we ?
this is my bed , but this is not the temple , nor my father &apos;s palace .
do not look , Anck-es-en-Amon .
do not be afraid .
I was afraid . when you knelt beside my bed , a veil came over my eyes . darkness .
your last memory is of me in the hour of your death as I knelt by your bed , 3700 years ago .
no man has ever suffered for woman as you suffered for me .
- Now that the gods have forgiven us ...
- No , no , not yet .
your soul is in a mortal body , renewed many times since we loved in Thebes of old .
but that love is not for us again until the great change .
I do not understand .
look .
- Look and wonder .
- A figure of myself .
it is my coffin , made by my father against my death .
what mummy has usurped my eternal resting place ?
it is thy dead shell . I tried then to raise this body .
I could raise it now , but it would be a mere thing that moved at my will , without a soul .
it was not only this body that I loved , it was thy soul .
I destroy this lifeless thing .
thou shalt take its place but for a few moments , and then rise again , even as I have risen .
come .
Imhotep , this is the place of embalming .
it is not lawful for me , a priestess of Isis , to see or touch an unclean thing .
come to the altar of Anubis , the guide of the dead .
the time has come for the final prayer .
what have I to do with Anubis ?
the ancient rites must be performed over thy body .
then I will read the great spell with which
Isis brought Osiris back from the grave .
and thou shalt rise again .
no .
no , I &apos;m alive !
I &apos;m young !
I won &apos;t die !
I loved you once , but now you belong with the dead .
I am Anck-es-en-Amon , but I ...
I &apos;m somebody else too .
I want to live , even in a strange new world .
for thy sake I was buried alive .
I ask of thee only a moment of agony . only so can we be united .
the bath of natron .
you shall not plunge my body into that .
let the deed be done .
let me go .
let me go !
don &apos;t kill me !
I &apos;m a priestess of Isis .
save me from that mummy !
it &apos;s dead !
save me !
I no longer fear you . do with me what you will .
Frank .
Frank !
she has gone to him . they must be in the museum .
now I know his horrible plan .
he is going to kill her , and make her a living mummy like himself .
the gods will receive into the underworld the spirit of Anck-es-en-Amon .
but not for long .
Osiris will release thy soul .
you shall rest from life , like the setting sun in the west .
but you shall dawn anew in the east , as the first rays of Amon-Ra dispel the shadow .
look !
what &apos;s that ?
come on .
Anck-es-en-Amon .
Frank !
Frank !
Helen !
Helen !
Helen .
O Isis , holy maiden . I was thy consecrated vestal .
I broke my vows . save me now !
teach me the ancient summons , the holy spells I &apos;ve forgotten .
I call upon thee as of old !
Helen !
call her .
he has dragged her back to ancient Egypt .
call her !
her love for you may bridge the centuries .
Helen .
Helen !
come back .
it &apos;s Frank .
come back .
now listen , men .
spring is here ... and spring is a dangerous time of the year , especially in Paris .
the wanderlust is in the air .
travelers are coming here from everywhere - from Cincinnati and Singapore .
- Now , what do they come for ?
- &#91; Together &#93; We know .
that &apos;s right . Chicago packers don &apos;t come here for a plate of cold cuts .
big planters don &apos;t come from Brazil just for nuts .
from Norway and Sweden , they don &apos;t come here to fish .
but whether they come from Amsterdam or Birmingham or Siam ... we let them do whatever they wish .
we let them play in any way ... as long as they &apos;re willing to pay .
&#91; together &#93; That &apos;s okay .
but spring is here .
and after dark , our cafés are empty .
but every park has standing room only every night .
- Now that &apos;s wrong . - That &apos;s right .
the situation is not funny .
our best cafés are losing money .
we must clean up the public parks .
we must clean up the public parks .
here &apos;s your slogan :
cleaner parks and more prosperity .
&#91; all &#93; Cleaner parks . cleaner parks . more prosperity .
come on . come on . where do you think you are ?
what are you doing ?
what &apos;s going on here ?
the French Revolution .
Hey ! you can &apos;t make love in public .
- I can make love anywhere . - No , you can &apos;t .
- Oh , but , Officer , he can . - Darling !
get up .
- What &apos;s your name ? - Dr. Bertier .
and your name ?
Madame Bertier .
- So you &apos;re married , eh ?
- Yes , Officer .
and you expect me to believe that ?
- Oh , please . - Please .
now let me tell you something .
you &apos;re the only married couple in this park .
&#91; Chuckles &#93; Get out !
well , there &apos;s only one other place to go .
why not ?
listen , Officer . do you see that moon ?
if he could talk French , do you know what he would say to you ?
Phooey .
ladies and gentlemen , I must talk to you .
this is a very delicate situation .
there is Colette , and here am I .
and I know what you think . Oh ! I know .
how dare you .
you remember that policeman ?
he was wrong . and so are you .
believe it or not , we are married .
I am her husband .
and she is my wife .
and I can prove it to you .
Oh , look . this is a picture of our wedding .
myself and the bridesmaids .
and this is my wife .
before the wedding , naturally .
and look at this lady .
my mother-in-law .
a marvelous cook .
in other words , I am married , and I like it .
I &apos;m sorry to disappoint you .
now , gentlemen , as a doctor ... let me ask you a personal question .
how long since you have been in a park ?
I mean - I mean , with your wife .
Ah . ladies , that &apos;s what &apos;s wrong .
build up your park life to ensure your home life .
&#91; Colette &#93; Darllng .
that &apos;s for me . sweetheart .
that &apos;s for her . I &apos;ll be with you in a minute .
that &apos;s for both of us .
Vlve la France .

in Switzerland we have a very peculiar law .
when a husband shoots his wife , they put him in jail .
- Is this taxi engaged ?
- Yes , madame .
Oh , that &apos;s too bad .
but , madame -
- Really , I - I hate to do this , monsieur . - It &apos;s perfectly all right , madame .
but perhaps both of us - Perhaps I could drop you , if you -
- I &apos;m going towards the Bois . - So am I .
- Oh . that &apos;s fine . - Oh , that &apos;s splendid .
- Professor- - Yes .
speaking &quot; detectively , &quot; you &apos;re as good as divorced right now .
do you think the Five-Year Plan will go over ?
Madame , I don &apos;t believe in making plans .
neither do I , monsieur .
I leave everything to the moment .
it &apos;s a very good place to live in .
you know , I think it was awfully sweet of you to take me along .
I think so too .
Oh , monsieur , you &apos;re conceited .
no , madame . I am married .
so , you have a wife .
Mm-hmm . and she has a husband .
Mmm . I can imagine .
- Madame . - Monsieur .
tell me . do you see anything wrong in us being alone together in this cab ?
- Absolutely not . - Neither do I .
two strange people of opposite sex , riding in a cab ... sitting side by side .
the gentleman reading a newspaper .
&#91; Chuckles &#93; The lady looking out of the window .
explain that to your wife .
she won &apos;t believe it ! would you believe it ?
- Never ! - I wouldn &apos;t believe it myself .
no , and let me tell you something . my husband wouldn &apos;t believe it either .
Your-Y-Your-
Oh , m-madame , we &apos;re in a terrible situation .
Oh , we &apos;re as good as guilty . all the facts are against us .

Madame .

- Mitzi ! - Colette !
&#91; together &#93; Darling !
&#91; together &#93; You look marvelous !
Oh , Mitzi , my darling . how have you been ?
I haven &apos;t seen you since that day in Lausanne .
I &apos;ve so much to tell you I can hardly begin .
but werert we happy and gay in Lausanne ?
you look just as smart and as stunning as then .
Oh , I &apos;m much wiser , though , thanks to several men .
Oh , how &apos;s the composer you went with so much ?
he &apos;s gone , but he had such a wonderful touch .
and the painter who painted you all draped in gauze ?
one night I found out what an artist he was .
your boudoir &apos;s adorable , simply divine .
and that bed - It &apos;s too gorgeous . I wish it were mine .
my favorite perfume . Femme de Paris .
Yes . Andre &apos;s so generous . he gave it to me .
- Ah .
- Oh , I must show you my new lingerie .
too stunning for only a husband to see .
- Those dresses - how thrilling !
- Yes , they &apos;re really quite fair .
I was just telling Andre how I &apos;ve nothing to wear .
- Ah ?
- Of course , these are his .
Oh , they &apos;re as cute as can be .
but where is the rest of them ?
Oh , pardon me .
- Well - - Colette !
I buy all his things , and believe it or not , he wears even the ties .
- Well , he must love you a lot . - How &apos;s the professor ?
- Which one do you mean ?
- The one that you married .
- Oh , he &apos;s still on the scene . - You don &apos;t sound so happy .
unless you &apos;re well mated , this business of marriage is much overrated .
Oh , Mitzi , you don &apos;t know how sorry I feel .
as for Andre and me - well , he &apos;s just too ideal .
he sets me atingle . I set him aflame .
# And no matter what happens #
# We still stay the same #
# Day after day #
# We will always be sweethearts the same #
# As the day we began #
# Do what he may #
# We will always be sweethearts #
# For he is my boy #
# And my man #
# He kisses me and my lips are so willing #
# But we both agree #
# That each time it &apos;s more thrilling #
# And so I can say #
# We will always be sweethearts the same #
# As the day #
# We began # #

let her get two other doctors . I don &apos;t want to mix business with Mitzi .
he doesn &apos;t want to mix business with you .
- Why can &apos;t you be nice to my friends ?
- But this is business . this is different .
- You hate her . - Oh , darling , don &apos;t be ridiculous .
- I have nothing against her . - I know you hate her .
- But why should I hate her ? - Well , you certainly don &apos;t like her .
I &apos;m crazy about her !
- Then why don &apos;t you want to go ?
- Because I don &apos;t want to mix &quot; musiness &quot; with Bitzi .

Yes , Madame Bertier . Yes . thank you .

Madame , you sent for me .
I want it to be clearly understood that you &apos;re sick .
Oh , Doctor .

# If I have to examine you let me see your tongue #

- # Just touch my cheek # - # Let me take a look at your mouth #
# Say Ahhh #
# Ahhh #
# I know it can &apos;t be chronic but if you feel this way #
# Perhaps you need a little tonic three times a day #
# My head is simply reeling Oh , Doctor , don &apos;t delay #
- # How often do you get this feeling # - # Three times a day #
# You seem to be in perfect shape as far as I can see #
# Are you a doctor or a saint #
# Hold me , please I &apos;m going to faint #
- # You surely need attention # - # Do something right away #
# Now , just take two of these in water three times a day #
# But what if this sensation should fail to go away #
# Then try a real hot application three times a day #
- # I don &apos;t know why you fear me # - # Oh , I wish that I could stay #
# I &apos;d not complain if you were near me three times a day #
# If you &apos;re not better I &apos;ll be back tomorrow afternoon #
# Oh , Doctor , if you understood you could do me so much good #
- # This tonic ought to help you # - # I know a sweeter way #

Mitzi , I suspect Andre .

# It &apos;s sweet when the band is playing #
# To hold you in my arms #
# But I haven &apos;t time for saying #
# What I think of your charms #
# It &apos;s wonderful to be swaying #
# To music of the dance #
# But I &apos;d rather be obeying #
# The music of romance #
# How I would love #
# One hour with you #
# One hour of #
# Just being with you #
# Then I could say #
# What I &apos;m feeling #
# And conceallng #
# In my heart #
# Tonlght when all #
# Our dancing Is through #
# And moonbeams fall #
# On roses and dew #
# Perhaps you may even say #
# That you love me too #
# And let me stay #
# One hour with you #
# How I would love #
# One hour with you #
# I &apos;m thinking of #
# The same thing as you #
# Then why delay #
# Just one reason #
# What &apos;s the reason #
# It &apos;s my wife #
# How I &apos;d enjoy #
# One hour with you #
# You silly boy #
# Just what will you do #
# Leave that to me #
# Now I see what champagne will do #
# No , no Honestly #
# I &apos;m tipsy for you #
# How I would love #
# One hour with you #
# I &apos;m tired of #
# This hullabaloo #
# You used to say #
# You liked dancing #
# I love dancing #
# But with you #
# It &apos;s not so much #
# The steps that you do #
# Your very touch #
# Can make me say Ooh #
# We &apos;ll have a chance for romance #
# When the party &apos;s through #
# It &apos;s all a bore #
# Unless I &apos;m with you # #
Mitzi , please , don &apos;t .
Mitzi , don &apos;t be so Mitzi .
why do you do that ? I can &apos;t tie a tie .
I never could tie a tie .
but I can tie a tie ... and how .
- There you are . - &#91; Chuckles &#93;
just a sample .
Mitzi !
Mitzi !
Mitzi , my tie !
pardon me .
I &apos;m a prisoner on my own veranda .
if I go inside , my wife sees me ... and I get into trouble .
if I go to the garden to Mitzi , I get into trouble too .
but anyhow , I get my tie fixed .
what shall I do ?
I go inside , my wife sees me , and I get into trouble .
I go to the garden to Mitzi , I get into trouble , too , but anyhow , I get my tie fixed .

I go to the garden to Mitzi - &#91; Muttering &#93;
I get my tie fixed .
a night in May .
look at the moon .
Colette , how does the moon affect you ?
it turns me inside out and upside down .
I tell you , if I didn &apos;t have such a splendid education , I &apos;d -
I &apos;d yield to the animal in me .
Yes , I - I admit I come of a very fine family .
well , should a refined gentleman not have any luck ?
does one have to be a roughneck to get along in the world ?
I wonder where Andre is .
I love you , Colette .
Colette , I love you .
let &apos;s - Let &apos;s - Let &apos;s run away .
- You &apos;re still a young woman . - Andre !
my tie . my tie .
- Andre . - Andre !
Andre ?
Andre ?
Oh !
- We had a most delightful time , Doctor . - Thank you .
- Good night . - Good night , Andre .
- Good night . - Thank you .
good night , Dr. Bertier . I had a perfectly charming evening .
- Thank you so much . - It was a pleasure , madame .
I &apos;ll be waiting in a taxi on the next corner for five minutes .
impossible .
- Ten minutes . - Ridiculous .
all right . fifteen minutes .
positively maybe .
Good-bye , madame .
- Good night . - Good night .

# I still can feel it yet #
# And now I &apos;m in a spot And what a spot #
# For right out there is Mitzi and right up there Colette #
# Should I be brave and misbehave or not #
# Should I say yes or no #
# Should I stay home or go #
# Why should I be afraid to fall #
# I &apos;m only human after all #
# I love Colette #
# I &apos;m crazy for Colette #
# But , oh , that Mitzi #
# I kiss Colette #
# And I get all upset #
# But , oh , that Mitzi #
# To stay or go I really can &apos;t decide #
# But this I know We can &apos;t all three be satisfied #
# I love Colette I haven &apos;t weakened yet #
# But , oh , that Mitzi #
# Some girls are slow Some even answer &quot; no &quot; #
# But , oh , that Mitzi #
# Some girls are cool and others only fool #
# But , oh , that Mitzi #
# There &apos;s no mistake about the way she clings #
# Why , she could make an angel throw away his wings #
# And yet I claim Colette can do the same #
# But , oh , that Mitzi # #
why don &apos;t you go back to Mademoiselle Martel ?
- &#91; Chuckling &#93; Oh , darling . - It may be a joke to you , but it -
our romance is over .
Oh , darling .
if I wanted to start something with Mademoiselle Martel ... would I do it here ?
Couldrt I call her to my office ?
so , that &apos;s what goes on in your office !
darling , we have been married for three years .
and for three years , you &apos;ve gone to your office every day .
sweetheart , take my word - This Martel girl -
- I don &apos;t believe you ! - I demand that you believe me .
I saw what I saw . &#91; sobbing &#93;
let &apos;s not talk about it .
let me take you in my arms . I love you .
you &apos;re lying ! &#91; Sobs &#93;
- Darling , if you don &apos;t believe me - - &#91; Horn Honks &#93;
if you don &apos;t believe me , in two and a half minutes , I &apos;m going out .
Oh . so you &apos;re threatening me , are you ?
all right . go out .
darling , I warn you , I &apos;m going .
I heard you . go !
all right .
- I &apos;m going . - My compliments to Mademoiselle Martel .
Andre !
Andre !
Andre !
Adolph !
- I &apos;ve come to stay . - Adolph !
- # I &apos;m dying for one hour with you # - Adolph , the party &apos;s over .
- # I &apos;ve got to pour my love out to you # - What &apos;s the matter with you ?
- # I &apos;m just insane with desire # - Adolph , this is ridiculous !
- I don &apos;t know whether to laugh or scream . - # I &apos;m on fire #
- I want you to leave this house at once . - # Have a heart # #
Andre !
you &apos;ll have to call louder than that if you want Andre to hear you .
but if you want Adolph , all you have to do is whisper .
Oh . &#91; crying &#93;
sorrow makes you look even more beautiful .
thank you , Adolph .
more feminine ... younger .
- Do you really think so ?
- I do , Colette .
Oh , thank you , Adolph .
any man who leaves a woman like you ... on a night like this , with a man like me ... deserves it .
but it was my fault . I was wrong .
you have a right to be wrong .
you &apos;re a woman . women are born to be wrong .
I like my women wrong .
you poor , lonely little thing .
Oh , I &apos;m so unappy .
- You need love . - Yes . love .
lots of love .
lots of love .
get out !
get out , or I &apos;ll call my husband !
- Oh , darling . - My dear , how excited you seem .
I just had a dream , a terrible dream .
I dreamed that last night , when you were gone , I was downstairs alone and -
Yes , yes ?
go on .
suddenly a man took hold of me . I - I struggled , and he -
- Choked you ?
- No .
- Shot you ?
- No .
what did he do ?
he kissed me .
Oh . kissed you .
&#91; Chuckling &#93; Your dream shall come true .
but the man wasrt you .
someone I know ?
- He &apos;s your pal . - What a pal !
- It was Adolph . - Oh , no . not Adolph .
Adolph !
# And still I feel guilty #
# It doesn &apos;t seem right #
# But you shouldn &apos;t leave me #
# At night #
# Day after day #
# We will always be sweethearts #
# The same as the day #
# We began #
# Dream what I may #
# We will always be sweethearts #
# My lips are for no other man #
# Dear , never fear #
# I won &apos;t ever neglect you #
# Each night I &apos;ll be here #
# To adore and protect you #
# And year after year #
# We will always be sweethearts #
# The same as the day #
# We began # #
- &#91; Knocklng &#93; - &#91; Colette &#93; Come In .
darling , whatever-
- Professor !
- Doctor .
- Oh , it &apos;s nice of you to drop in . - Uh-huh .
- We missed you a lot last night . - &#91; Chuckles &#93;
- &#91; Chuckles &#93; Wort you sit down ? - Thank you . Yes .
- Excuse me one minute . - Yes .
- Uh , it &apos;s a bit drafty , eh ? - Yes .
did you , uh , have a good time last night ?
well , we -we tried our best .
first we had , uh -we had dinner .
then we danced .
and then we -we played a little .
played ?
may I ask what ?
- Cards . - Cards ?
bridge .
you didn &apos;t play cards last night , Doctor .
Oh !
Professor .
I ought to know . &#91; Chuckling &#93;
you were in my apartment last night .
- In your apartment ?
- Mm-hmm .
let me see .
you left your house ... at 2 : 10 .
you went to the corner , jumped into a cab .
my wife was in that cab .
Yes . Yes , that &apos;s true .
that &apos;s absolutely true .
uh , your-your wife - your wife was alone .
see , naturally , as her host ...
I wanted to see her get home safely .
thank you for protecting my wife , Doctor .
- It was only my duty , Professor . - Yes .
now , let me see
-The car arrived in front of my house at 2 : 35 .
you and my wife stayed in the car ... for eight minutes ... up to 2 : 43 .
right . right .
your-your wife just - just asked me something .
and then I answered .
then another question , and then another answer .
one question follows an answer . you know ? &#91; Chuckling &#93;
eight minutes - Eight minutes can go like that !
Yes . Yes .
then you , uh - you got out of the car .
you went to the house , and at the door ... my wife handed you the key .
you unlocked the door ... and after a short conversation , you went in .
this was exactly 2 : 51 .
uh -Am I boring you ?
Oh , not at all , Professor .
uh , yes , y-your wife - your wife said ...
&quot; wort you come up and have a little brandy ? &quot;
and I said , &quot; Ah , a little brandy can &apos;t hurt . &quot;
- So , I - I went up . - Yes .
and , uh - And you had the brandy ?
Yes .
was it good brandy , Doctor ?
excellent , Professor .
you drank this brandy from 2 : 53 ... to 4 : 44 .
Professor , I assure you ... that there is absolutely nothing wrong .
we just -We just had a chat ... and a few laughs .
you know , y-your wife - your wife is very amusing .
Yes , everyone says so . it must be true .
now , Professor , all appearances are against me .
I know . I know . but let me tell you again -
not another word , Doctor .
- I believe you . - Thank you .
you &apos;re very welcome . I believe you .
but no one else will . &#91; Chuckles &#93; Too bad , isn &apos;t it ?
I just came up here this morning to ask you ... if you would appear , voluntarily , as a ... shall we say , witness in my divorce suit ?
Professor , please believe me .
I &apos;m an innocent man .
I &apos;m not guilty . and neither is Mitzi .
I mean - I mean , your wife .
my friend - May I call you my friend ?
- Please . - My friend , nobody is guilty .
I have a theory that nobody is responsible for their actions .
right ! that &apos;s absolutely right .
our doings are controlled by circumstances over which we have no control .
Oh , excellent . Truer words have never been spoken .
therefore , nobody can be held responsible for his actions .
Oh , what a beautiful thought , Professor .
you know - You know that you &apos;re a poet ?
&#91; Chuckles &#93; This , of course , has nothing whatever to do with our case .
- Good morning , Professor . - Madame .
Ah , I &apos;m so glad you dropped in .
we should see each other more often .
&#91; Chuckles &#93; I &apos;m afraid the doctor doesn &apos;t like me .
Oh , Professor . where did you get such an idea ?
Oh , by the way , how &apos;s Mitzi ?
- Mitzi ?
- Yes .
Oh , Mitzi . uh , let me see .
she left this morning for Lausanne .
- Lausanne ?
- Mmm .
- Oh , to see her mother . - I suppose so .
- I hope nothing &apos;s happened to her mother . - To her mother ?
no , I don &apos;t think so .
well , we &apos;ll see . I &apos;m sorry , but I must be going now .
well , you must come again sometime .
and when you write Mitzi , you &apos;ll give her my best regards , won &apos;t you ?
Oh , I surely will . and yours , Doctor ?
please .
- Well , good-bye . - Good-bye .
- Good-bye . - Good-bye .
don &apos;t you think he behaved strangely ?
Oh , no , not at all .
Andre ?
there &apos;s something wrong between the professor and Mitzi .
Oh . what an idea , Colette .
I feel it . I feel it . my womars instinct tells me .
and there &apos;s a man in it .
Andre ?
you know who the man is ?
- Who ?
- This Russian artist Rodovsky .
- No . no , it &apos;s not Rodovsky . - How do you know ?
I don &apos;t know . I don &apos;t know . my
I tell you , it &apos;s Rodovsky .
all right . all right .
&#91; Chuckles &#93; Let &apos;s hope it &apos;s Rodovsky .
you &apos;re right , Andre . it &apos;s not Rodovsky .
now I know who it is .
- Who ?
- That American - Goldberg .
maybe - Maybe you &apos;re right .
I - I wouldn &apos;t be surprised if it were Goldberg .
Andre !
- I have it now . - Who ?
no . no . no , it can &apos;t be .
# I didn &apos;t want to do what I did but I did #
# And now what can I do #
# I &apos;d better take a trip Yes , a trip on a ship #
# To China or Peru #
# I knew the moment that she began #
# Where it was leading to #
# It might have happened to any man #
# It might have happened to you #
# It was late and she was lonely #
# And she begged for sympathy only #
# Now I ask you what would you do #
# In a case like that #
# If her head was on your shoulder #
# And she grew a little bit bolder #
# Now I ask you what would you do #
# With a girl like that #
# Do you think you could resist her #
# Do you think you wouldn &apos;t have kissed her #
# Would you treat her like a sister #
# Come on , be honest , mister #
# If you saw her turn the light out #
# Would you get your hat and get right out #
# Now I ask you what would you do #
&#91; Chuckles &#93; # That &apos;s what I did too #
# It was late and she was lonely #
# And she begged for sympathy only #
# Now I ask you what would you do #
# In a case like that #
# If her head was on your shoulder #
# And she grew a little bit bolder #
# Oh , I ask you what would you do #
# With a girl like that #
# Do you think you could resist her #
# Do you think you wouldn &apos;t have kissed her #
# Would you treat her like your sister #
# Oh , come on Be honest , mister #
# If you had a sweet and pure wife #
# Wouldrt you be faithful to your wife #
# Now I ask you what would you do #
# Heh , that &apos;s what I did too # #

Yes . wonderful .
- Feel strong ?
- Great !
strong enough to face - to take a-a nice - a nice , long walk with me ?
I &apos;d love it .
sit down , darling .
darling , I &apos;ve got to disillusion you .
your instinct was right .
there is something wrong in Mitzi &apos;s marriage .
Didrt I tell you ?
Didrt I tell you ?
and who wouldn &apos;t believe me ? &#91; laughing &#93;
Oh , darling , tell me . tell me all about it .
you were right . there &apos;s a man in it .
&#91; Squeals &#93; Rodovsky ?
- No . - Goldberg ?
- No . - But who is it , darling ?
tell me , who ?
me .
you ?
you ?
my husband ... and my very best friend .
look at me , Andre .
Oh ! &#91; crying &#93;
go away !
either you leave this house or I do .
- But , sweetheart - - Our marriage is over .
- Darling - - From now on you &apos;re nothing but a doctor to me .
- I love you . - Tell it to my lawyer .
believe me , there was nothing wrong in it .
I know I shouldn &apos;t have done it ... but please , please forgive me for- for what I didn &apos;t do .
I don &apos;t want to hear another word !
you can keep the house , my jewels , the furniture , everything !
I don &apos;t want any alimony ! &#91; crying Continues &#93;
how do you do , sir ?
Adolph .
don &apos;t go .
sweetheart , you must forgive me .
forgive you ?
I &apos;m in no position to forgive you .
you think you were bad ?
you were just a naughty little boy .
look at me . I &apos;m the one that &apos;s bad .
you think you &apos;re a Don Juan , eh ?
well , if you &apos;re a Don Juan , then I &apos;m a Cleopatra .
you , with your one hour .
what &apos;s your one hour compared with my 25 minutes ?
remember the dream I told you about Adolph and me ?
well , that was no dream . it happened , right here , on the night of our party .
- Oh , so you think a man couldn &apos;t fall in love with me .
- Let me kiss you . - You think I &apos;m not attractive enough ?
- Maybe I &apos;m too old . - &#91; Laughing &#93;
- Well , I &apos;ll show you . - Oh , darling ! darling .
Adolph !
Adolph , I want the truth ... and nothing but the truth .
after the party was over , did you or did you not ... wait in the garden till after Andre had gone ?
and didn &apos;t you come into the house in the dark ?
and didn &apos;t I find you on the couch ?
Yes .
well ?
sit down !
and then , Adolph , didn &apos;t you , with - with an uncontrollable impulse - didn &apos;t you untie your tie ?
- Yes . - Well ?
sit down !
and then , Adolph - then didn &apos;t you take me in your arms and kiss me ?
and didn &apos;t we sit on the couch , and didn &apos;t you kiss me again ?
and didn &apos;t I like it ?
- I guess so . - Answer yes or no !
- Yes . - Well ?
sit down !
well , Doctor ? we &apos;re even .
a tooth for a tooth , an eye for an eye ... an Adolph for a Mitzi .
fifty-fifty .
but if I ever catch you aga -
kiss me , sweetheart .
- You don &apos;t mind , do you , Adolph ?
- No .
- Ladies - - And gentlemen -
- If he were your husband - - And she were your wife -
and you find out he &apos;s a Don Juan -
and you find out that she has dreams -
- And he confesses - - And she admits -
- But you like him - - And you love her-
- And you adore him - - And you &apos;re crazy about her-
what would you do ?
that &apos;s what I do too .
&apos;Ecstasy&apos;

cry , when love broke your heart ...
flowers bloom and wither to then grow again , when the sweet song of the birds is heard in the fields and woods .

cry , when love broke your heart .
cry , why shouldn &apos;t you ?
and laugh , like youth and beauty do when life still promises joy and happiness .
cry , when love broke your heart .

thank you , Bridges .
- Everything ready , Bridges ? - Yes , sir .
I thought we should never get here in time .
I &apos;m sure that cabbie was tipsy , Robert .
so am I. He called me his old cockalorum .
- Gave him another shilling .
you didn &apos;t mind our leaving the others and coming on home &apos; ?
why , darling , I loved you for thinking of it .
I hoped you would .
- Oh , Ellen , what lovely flowers .
- They &apos;re from Bridges and me , ma &apos;am , with our very best wishes , I &apos;m sure .
- Oh , Ellen .
- Thank you both , so much .
not at all , sir . it &apos;s a ... It &apos;s a pleasure , indeed .
how sweet of them to think of giving us flowers on New Year &apos;s Eve .
rather touching .
so touching that I almost want to cry .
well , if you must . this evening was planned sentimentally .
sentimentally , but not tragically .
splendid !
you &apos;ll have to hurry up , cook , if you want to see them celebrations .
now ... Now , which would you wear , Mr. Bridges ...
this nice porkpie hat or the lovely picture hat the missus give me &apos; ?
well , why not wear them both and go as Lady Godiva ? you &apos;re vulgar .
Oh , look what you &apos;re doing , squeezing that thing in people &apos;s eyes and blinding them .
you &apos;ll be blinding someone if you went as Lady Godiva .
Oh ? indeed ?
watch your step , cookie , when you &apos;re celebratin &apos; .
you know what you &apos;re like after you &apos;ve had a couple of snifters .
don &apos;t be disgusting &apos; , Mr. Bridges .
new Year &apos;s Eve &apos;s gone to her head and no mistake .
she &apos;s been queer all day .
says she feels like as if it &apos;s the end of everything .
Oh , so do I , for that matter .
Oh , don &apos;t start that all over again . Oh , Alf , we &apos;ve been so happy here in service .
can &apos;t bear to think what it &apos;s going to be like when you &apos;ve gone to the war .
well , don &apos;t .
you were never cut out for a soldier .
never mind what I was cut out for .
I am a soldier now , see ?
what &apos;s gonna happen to me and baby if anything happens to you ?
now , look here , old girl . you married me for better or for worse .
not for this kind of worse , I didn &apos;t .
you gallivanting in Africa , and me stopping at home .
Oh , you got a lot to take on about , I don &apos;t think .
look at the missus and her brother out there in that there Mafeking , besieged by them there Boers right from the beginning .
not enough to eat , only horses and rats .
Yes , and now her husband &apos;s going and two growing boys to look after .
- Sense ?
what &apos;s the sense in the war ?
nobody wanted to have a war .
we have to have wars now and then just to prove we &apos;re top dog .
now , stop arguing and help me get out this punch or the bells will be ringing and they won &apos;t have anything to drink .
you look so beautiful tonight .
- Do I , Robert ?
- Only your dress , I suppose . very deceiving .
Yes , Robert .
- And the star in your hair .
- And the star in my hair .
and the fact that I love you so very , very much .
after ten whole years and two enormous children , how can you ?
perhaps you &apos;re hideous and ill-dispositioned and tedious really , and I never knew .
- Perhaps .
- Well , it &apos;s too late now . I &apos;m set in the habit of loving you .
I shall never know the truth .
Oh , how wonderful our marriage has been .
&quot; has &quot; ?
give the future a chance .
we don &apos;t know if there is to be a future , now .
that &apos;s a cheerful thought for the new century .
about as cheerful as the thought of being without you .
Oh , Robert , my dear , I shall miss you so .
what does it matter about the war , about the Boers ?
it can &apos;t matter , really .
aren &apos;t you forgetting about your brother Jim in Mafeking ,
- hemmed in by the Boers ?
- No , I &apos;m not forgetting Jim .
- But it does seem so desperately hard . - What does ?
- Nothing .
I was merely behaving badly .
- You ? you couldn &apos;t behave badly .
- I suppose this war will end someday .
- Why , of course . - In a few months !
- Perhaps it &apos;ll be over before you get there .
perhaps .
I believe you &apos;d hate that .
I wonder if Jim &apos;s still alive .
of course he &apos;s alive . they &apos;re all alive .
Mafeking &apos;s bound to be relieved soon .
- Just on time , sir . nearly midnight .
- Put it down there , Bridges .
- Stay and drink with us , won &apos;t you ?
- Thank you very much , ma &apos;am . - Thank you , ma &apos;am .
- That &apos;s right . - Mum ! - Oh , the children .
how very impolite of the 20th century to wake up the children .
Mum . Oh , Joey , you awful child .
how dare you make such a noise .
Oh , darling , you haven &apos;t got a pain , have you ?
- I want to see New Year . - Little boys mustn &apos;t .
what would you say if I spanked you soundly and sent you to bed ?
I would say , old woman that lived in the shoe .
and what would you say if I spanked you again for calling your mother an old woman ?
I would say nothing .
Mum , can we see New Year tomorrow instead ? Shh .
you &apos;ll wake up Edward . by George , we ought to have the children down .
a new century is a new century .
Ellen , go and get &apos; em some milk to drink good luck .
- Darling ... - Shh .
they &apos;re asleep .
thank heaven they &apos;re too young to fight .
peace and happiness for you , my darlings .
please , God .
peace and happiness always .
darling , let &apos;s take them downstairs .
no , it &apos;s bad to break their sleep .
once in a century won &apos;t matter , surely . just for once .
- Oh , well . - Oh , Mum , how lovely !
quiet , you naughty little scamp .
- Come along , Edward .
- What , Mum , what ?
- We &apos;re going down to see New Year !
- New Year ?
come on . put this on , dear .
- Do we sing , Daddy ? - Do we not ?
- This is yours , Joey . - Thank you .
- Here you are , dear . - Thank you , darling .
Nineteen hundred ! happy new century !
Nineteen hundred ! Nineteen hundred !
ls Mrs. Marryot in ?
- To you , ma &apos;am , yes .
- Come on .
but , Mum , we wanted to go down and see Daddy off on the ship .
I know , darling , but you simply can &apos;t .
Joey &apos;s cold &apos;s much too bad . you wouldn &apos;t leave Joey all alone , would you ?
Mrs. Harris and Miss Edith , ma &apos;am .
- Oh , Margaret , how nice of you . - Jane darling .
Edith , run along .
Robert &apos;s gone to report at the barracks .
he &apos;s got leave to travel down to the boat with me .
Oh . Oh , then , perhaps you &apos;d like me to stay and amuse the children till you get back .
- Oh , my dear , do . - Mmm .
Oh , hello , Margaret .
you &apos;re on parade early . - I just ran in to say good-bye .
- Oh , how kind . uh ...
what the dickens ?
stand easy .
now , youngsters , I want you to look after your mother very carefully while I &apos;m away .
- Yes , Dad . - And be very good and learn your lessons and all that .
Dad , is Bobs a very big soldier ?
Lord Roberts , if you please . he &apos;s head of all the soldiers .
- Who &apos;s head of all the Boers ?
- President Kruger .
and you and Bobs are going to fight Kruger ?
that &apos;s right .
are you going to cut Kruger all in pieces with your sword ?
- You blood-thirsty little devil !
- Oh , promise you will , Daddy .
all right . little tiny pieces .
there , I told you he would !
Oh , El , it won &apos;t seem like no time at all till Mr. Bridges comes home again .
- If he ever does come home again .
- Mother . now what have I said ?
well , we &apos;ll all have a good laugh when he does get back .
that &apos;s what they said about my poor Uncle Harry &apos;s brother Bill in the war against the Zulus .
but they never had that laugh &apos; cause he was cut in half with a assegai the day he landed .
attention !
Oh , here , here , here , here .
now , let &apos;s have a bit of life in it .
here , half a mo , cookie . someone &apos;s gonna eat that pastry - you &apos;re cryin &apos; into .
- Oh , Alf , don &apos;t be such a fool .
Oh , my Lord . here , Fanny . you can give your old dad a smile .
come and have a look at your old dad . look at his buttons .
all shined up nice and bright , ain &apos;t they ?
Oh , now , come on , old girl , now .
cryin &apos; won &apos;t do no good .
Fanny , your old dad &apos;s goin &apos; to the war .
he &apos;s gonna be a soldier of the Queen , my lass Who &apos;s been , my lass , to sea
how many days will they be at sea , Colonel ? sixteen .
it &apos;s 6,000 miles to South Africa .
you see , they land here at Cape Town , then proceed by rail to Kimberley .
then , by forced march , to Mafeking .
let &apos;s hope they get there in time .
Mafeking &apos;s in a very bad way .
it &apos;s doubtful they can hold out much longer .
isn &apos;t it a wonderful sight ?
I &apos;m wondering how many of them will come back alive .
it &apos;s come at last , hasn &apos;t it , this moment ?
- You &apos;ll be brave , won &apos;t you ?
- Take care of yourself . I shall probably be seasick .
then lie down flat on every possible occasion .
- I &apos;ll try to remember .
- Bridges will look after you .
perhaps he &apos;ll be lying down flat , too .
this is horrid , isn &apos;t it ?
I must go , too .
no , not just for a minute .
I really must go .
I &apos;m going to kiss you , then I want you to turn away and go on talking so you won &apos;t see .
Mm-hmm .
I &apos;m glad I didn &apos;t bring Edward and Joey .
they &apos;re too young , really , and they &apos;d get overexcited .
besides , Joey has a cold .
take care of yourself , my darling .
I felt you go when I said that bit about Joey .
Oh , Robert ! Robert !
well , so far , they seem to be all right .
thank God .
dirty old Kruger ! dirty old Kruger !
shut up , you silly kid , firing without orders !
- But I &apos;m relieving Mafeking . - You can &apos;t relieve it like that .
all right , then , I &apos;m defending Mafeking . - Shut up . you &apos;re wasting ammunition .
don &apos;t do it again ! you kids have no idea how to fight a battle .
- Sorry , Bob . - Get your men and guns over there .
- You &apos;re the Boers . - But I don &apos;t want to be the Boers .
- Somebody &apos;s got to be the Boers . - And that &apos;s all a girl &apos;s good for .
- I don &apos;t want to be the Boers . - But I tell you .
I won &apos;t be the Boers ! I won &apos;t be the Boers ! I won &apos;t be the Boers !
Oh , you cheat !
come on . stop , stop !
- What &apos;s the matter ?
- Edith doesn &apos;t like being the Boers . well , and who would ?
- Bang ! bang ! bang !
Oh , Joey , you &apos;re a naughty , wicked little boy . - Go straight upstairs this minute .
- Now , come here , Edith .
- Come here and don &apos;t be so silly . - Oh , go away , all of you .
Edward , take Joey upstairs .
can &apos;t you play any other game but soldiers , fighting each other , killing each other ?
now , run along up to the nursery , all of you . and behave yourselves .
there &apos;s no escape from that tune anywhere .
- Well , shall I throw him something ?
- Yes , you could throw it at him .
Oh , Jane dear .
Hi ! Hi !
will you go away ?
further down the street .
Jane dear , do sit down .
you &apos;ve been standing about all the afternoon .
- I don &apos;t believe I shall ever see them again .
- Nonsense . Mafeking &apos;s bound to be relieved in the next few days .
- All the papers say so .
- Everyone &apos;s been saying that for months .
my brother &apos;s still out there , dying by inches , starvation , disease and horror .
and Robert ... I can &apos;t bear to think of it and I can &apos;t stop thinking .
Oh , no news yet , Ellen .
have a nice cup of tea , ma &apos;am .
don &apos;t fret about the master , ma &apos;am .
he &apos;s all right .
you see , he &apos;s got my Alfred with him .
and we &apos;d be bound to hear if anything happened .
poor Ellen . it must be just as bad for you .
well , no news is good news , and what must be , must be .
that &apos;s what I say . you &apos;d never believe how that cheers you up .
now , come , darling . drink this tea . extra !
all about the war ! extra !
special , all about the war ! - Hi ! Hi !
- Latest from the front ! thank you , ma &apos;am .
thank you , lady . extra ! all about the war !
- Extra ! all about the war ! - What is it , Ellen ?
what is it ?
- Nothing , ma &apos;am .
all about the war ! extra ! paper !
&quot; no news is good news and what must be , must be . &quot;
now , look here , Jane dear .
I &apos;m going now , and I &apos;m coming back at a quarter to 7 : 00 . quarter to 7 : 00 .
why ? we &apos;re going out to dine at a restaurant and we &apos;re going to a theater .
restaurant ?
theater ?
by ourselves ? Oh , Margaret .
well , why not ? now , there &apos;s no sense in sitting at home fretting .
and it doesn &apos;t do any good .
we &apos;ll get Ronnie James to take us .
and if he can &apos;t , then we &apos;ll go by ourselves .
I don &apos;t care what people say .
it &apos;s sweet of you , Margaret , but I simply can &apos;t .
now , Jane dear ...
I &apos;m going home to have a bath and to put on my new Redfern model ,
- and I shall be back at a quarter to 7 : 00 . - But , Margaret , I ...
now , don &apos;t argue .
do just what you &apos;re told .
Robert and Jim would hate to think of you sitting at home weeping and wailing .
they &apos;re being gallant enough . we must be gallant , too . we &apos;ll dine at the Café Royal .
- Margaret , honestly , I ...
- Now ! we &apos;ll dine at the Café Royal .
play louder ! play louder !
soldiers of the Queen , wounded and dying , suffering for their Queen .
play louder ! play louder !
- Tell me something , Ada . - What ?
you &apos;re not a dairymaid , are you ?
Mr. Inquisitive ! well , what are you ?
- Me ? - Uh-huh .
Oh , I &apos;m lady &apos;s maid to the Princess Mirabelle .
the princess ?
then he wins his bet after all . who ?
what bet ?
Lieutenant Edgar .
all the officers on the ship wagered him that he would not win the hand of Princess Mirabelle .
he said he would marry her if she was as ugly as sin .
- Oh ! - He needs the money !
- Tom !
what are you doing here ? - Yes , sir . - Just coming , sir .
- Stop !
ladies and gentlemen , Mafeking has been relieved !
come and hold this fork a minute , Annie , or they &apos;ll have to call a fire brigade to put my face out .
I once knew a woman whose front hair caught fire when she was making toast .
and before you could count ten , the whole room was ablaze .
they &apos;d never have been able to recognize her remains
- if it hadn &apos;t been for her cameo brooch .
- Fancy that now .
and how &apos;s our ladyship today ?
who &apos;s a lovely girl ?
don &apos;t burn that toast , Annie . kitchy , kitchy , kitchy , kitchy , kitchy .
your dad &apos;s comin &apos; home today , love , safe and sound .
safe and sound .
I only hope he is safe and sound , I &apos;m sure .
you &apos;re a nice , cheerful body , I must say .
I &apos;ve had experience .
when I was a girl , a friend of mine &apos;s husband come home unexpected-like from the Crimea with no legs at all .
stop it , Annie ! now look what you &apos;ve done .
put another piece , quick ! they &apos;ll be here in a minute .
I do hope Ellen didn &apos;t cry at the station .
it does make her nose so red .
Alfred will be that pleased to see her that he won &apos;t care whether it &apos;s red or blue .
come on , Annie . hurry up .
- Where is Africa ?
- What do you mean , where &apos;s Africa ?
where is Africa ? - Don &apos;t be silly .
- Well , where is it ?
I never heard such an ignorant girl in all my life .
haven &apos;t you ever seen it on the map ?
I seen it on the map .
but where is it , really ?
you ought to be ashamed of yourself asking such daft questions .
well , do you know where it is , Mrs. Snapper ?
Oh , get away , Annie . you &apos;re getting on my nerves .
well , I would like to know where it is .
I was dying and laughing at the time .
that &apos;s right , Ellen , you pay . I want to see that baby of mine .
cheers , old blowhard . takes my kit in .
- How much ? - Half a crown .
Ooh-eh ! where &apos;s my love-a-duck ?
Hello , cook . Hello , Ma .
- Where &apos;s my girl ?
- There she is .
Ooh , ain &apos;t you grown ?
you ain &apos;t half been feedin &apos; her up , Ma .
look at her smile .
she knows her old dad .
here . put it down there .
- Good luck , old man . - Same to you , mate .
Ooh , I thought it would never come to an end , that I did .
and all the people yelling and screaming .
here , Alfred .
take your great head out of that pram or you &apos;ll frighten her .
Oh , she &apos;s knows me , that &apos;s what .
she knows her old dad .
look at her , rosette and all .
smart as me eye . Hello .
who &apos;s this ? we haven &apos;t had the pleasure .
- That &apos;s Annie . - Hello , Annie .
Oh , welcome home , Mr. Bridges . - Well , Ma , how &apos;s everything ?
- Well , I mustn &apos;t grumble .
I should just think not . I &apos;ve got a surprise for you .
- What is it ? - Ellen knows .
I told her in the cab . - Tell her , Ellen . - No , you .
go on . well , Ma ... You know I said in my letters about a lad named Herbert Smart ?
Yes . Ellen read your letters out loud .
- Not all of them , I hope .
- Get on with you .
you never let yourself go further than a PS and a couple of crosses . well , listen , Ma .
this chap &apos;s got a pub . - Pub ?
- A pub . a beer house .
Oh , now , don &apos;t pretend you don &apos;t know what a pub is , you rascal .
well , anyhow , he &apos;s got a pub in London here .
but he &apos;s stayin &apos; in Africa , so I bought it from him cheap .
now , you can come and live with us , Ma .
what do you say ?
is it a respectable pub ?
Oh , well , of course , it all depends how you behave , Ma .
you know what you &apos;re like after you &apos;ve had a couple of snifters .
- Well , what do you think ?
- What about them upstairs ?
Oh , that &apos;s all right . I took the master into me confidence .
he helped me with the money .
Oh , I can hardly believe it , not having to live alone anymore .
here , cheer up . have a cup of tea .
let &apos;s all have a cup of tea ! come on .
well , cookie , old girl , here , how would you like to be a barmaid ?
where is Africa , Mr. Bridges ?
well , I don &apos;t rightly know where it is , but it &apos;s bloody hot when you get there .
- We &apos;re so glad you &apos;re home , Daddy !
- Ohh . I &apos;ll be glad too when you stop pounding the breath out of me .
- Children , not quite so rough . - Did you see many Boers ?
Mmm ? Oh , yes , lots of them . - Did you kill any ?
- No , we won &apos;t go into that .
- Did you kill any lions ?
- Forty-four lions , a zebra , two ostriches and , uh ...
Oh , yes , a cockyolly bird .
what is a cockyolly bird ?
I &apos;ll come up and tell you tonight in the nursery .
now , then , off with you both . I want to talk to your mother .
- Can I wear your hat , Daddy ?
- You may . off with you .
quiet , Annie .
- Paper ! paper ! - What &apos;s he yelling about ?
paper ! extra special from the palace !
- The Queen ! paper ! - Well , what &apos;s the matter ?
it ain &apos;t nothing to concern us .
Oh , Ellen , how can you , when it concerns the whole country ? what concerns the whole country ?
Alfred &apos;s coming home is all that concerns me .
well , what are you all looking so miserable about ?
the Queen . the Queen ?
the Queen . it says she &apos;s sinking .
- There , I told you so . - Let &apos;s have a look .
she &apos;s very old , ain &apos;t she ?
Oh , be quiet , Annie . what &apos;s that got to do with it ?
well , I never seen her .
I have .
driving along Birdcage Walk once ...
years ago .
God . England won &apos;t half seem funny without the Queen .
Mum , will Father be riding in the beginning part of the procession or at the end &apos; ?
at the beginning , darling .
he &apos;ll be with the troops that go in front of the gun carriage with the Queen &apos;s coffin .
all these crowds of people .
they &apos;ve been waiting for hours , so patient and quiet .
there &apos;s hardly a sound .
I feel listless and sad ...
as though her death were a personal loss .
Mum ! Mum !
there &apos;s a policeman on a lovely white horse !
Oh , darling , don &apos;t jump about and get excited .
- Edward , keep Joey quiet . - Yes , Mum .
- Mum , could I ever be a policeman ?
- Perhaps , if you &apos;re very good .
- Are all policemen good ? - Oh , as good as gold .
why did Queen Victoria die , Mum ?
because she was a very old lady and very tired .
could I have another piece of cake ?
only a tiny piece , then . there .
and a piece for Edith . - And Edward . - Yes .
- There now , run along . - All right . - Here , Edith .
here &apos;s your piece . - Thank you .
- Which hand ? - That one .
- That &apos;s not my piece . - Yes , it is .
Edward &apos;s quite good , but Joey ...
- Well , Edward , are you all behaving ?
- Yes , Mum . - Listen , they &apos;re coming !
- The procession &apos;s in sight , - and the servants are here . - Oh , come in , all of you .
- You &apos;d better go out on that balcony . - Yes , ma &apos;am .
- Look ! look ! there &apos;s Father !
that was Lord Roberts . he held up his hand to stop them from cheering .
is that Bobs , Mum ?
is that Bobs ?
now , children , stand absolutely still , to attention as your father showed you .
five kings riding behind her .
Mum , she must have been a very little lady .
Adjutant General of the forces .
Lord and Lady Cumberland .
Captain Sir Albert Montague and Lady Montague .
his Eminence , the Cardinal Humbolt de la Torre .
Maharajah of Rantoula .
Earl and Countess of Norfolk .
- I met Lady Marryot there .
- Who did you say ?
Marryot ...
Jane Marryot .
Oh , her husband &apos;s just been knighted , you know .
Oh , those Marryots . I know them well .
- He thoroughly deserved his knighthood . - Yes .
his war record was splendid . you don &apos;t get a VC for nothing , you know .
Mrs. Harris and Captain Ronald James . - Good evening .
- How do you do .
- How do you do .
- Sir Robert and Lady Marryot .
- How do you do . - Nice to see you .
- How do you do . - And you , Sir Robert .
- So glad you could be here . - Thank you very much .
Mr. and Mrs. Geoffrey Pellier .
how do you do .
well , Sir Robert .
well , my lady .
- Isn &apos;t this fun ?
- I think I want to run away and hide .
however , it may get me a little respect from your children .
Oh , darling , they &apos;re wild with delight .
I &apos;m so proud of you , Robert .
it &apos;s all you , darling . always has been . is my hair all right ?
I remember we was just near Pretoria with the old regulars ...
Fusiliers and that lot .
they all seemed sort of helpless-like .
so I went up to the commanding officer , and I said , &quot; Look here ... &quot;
Mr. Bridges , is Harry good for a drink ? - Has he had it ?
- Yes . he &apos;s good for it .
- What say , Harry ?
- Hello , Alf . so I went to the commanding officer .
I said , &quot; Look here , &quot; I says .
&quot; these lads ain &apos;t got no initiative , &quot; I says . &quot; Righto , Bridges , &quot; he says .
&quot; you go down and tell them from me ... &quot; - Alfred !
- Coming . &quot; go down , Bridges , &quot; he says , &quot; And tell the commanding officer from me ... &quot;
Alfred , will you kindly come in here a minute ?
I &apos;ll tell you what he said when I come back .
well , what is it ?
Oh , come in here .
Alfred , how can you go on like this day after day ? - What &apos;s the matter ?
- I thought you was gonna pay the rent to the brewers this afternoon .
- Well , what about it ? - What about it ?
you ain &apos;t never been on time with the rent yet .
do you want to have us turned out of the place ?
well , I &apos;ve got to look after me bar , I suppose .
you ain &apos;t gotta go and drink up all the profits .
Oh , Alfred , ain &apos;t you got no pride left ?
you were so respectable when we was in service .
well , you don &apos;t have to snap a man &apos;s head off just &apos; cause he wants to be his own boss .
fine boss you are .
dressed up like a public house loafer . now look here , Ellen .
don &apos;t you make me have to speak to you severe .
I &apos;m the boss here , see ? and my clothes are my affair .
matter of fact , I was going along to the brewers now , see &apos; ?
but don &apos;t you tell me what I gotta do .
- Has he gone ? - Yes , he &apos;s gone .
Hello , Fanny , me girl . been doing your lessons ? Yeah .
come on . give your old dad a kiss .
too proud to kiss your old dad , eh ? come on , now .
you &apos;ll do as you &apos;re told . go on .
get inside . don &apos;t stay out here playing on the streets .
freedom ain &apos;t for everybody .
there &apos;s some that it &apos;s better for them to have a firm hand over them .
Oh , Mother . my , you are late . here , put your books down .
and go upstairs and put on your white dress .
go on , hurry ! - Hello , Alf .
- Hello .
- Hello , Alf . - Hello there .
Hello , mate . - Hello , Alf . how &apos; bout one ?
- No , nothing to drink .
just going to the brewery .
business , see ? Oh , one won &apos;t hurt ya . all right .
- Only one , mind you . - That &apos;s all we &apos;re going to have , just one .
why , Ellen , she dances beautifully .
come here , dear .
I knew you when you were a little tiny baby .
the child &apos;s a born dancer , if you ask me .
highly talented . highly .
on the go , you know , from morning till night .
have you any children , Annie ?
well , I haven &apos;t exactly , if you know what I mean .
George don &apos;t believe in families . not in the retail business .
now , what I mean , you &apos;ve got enough to do to look after the shop .
Oh , I see .
you see , my cousin George is a greengrocer , milady .
I see .
can I press you to another cup , my ladyship ?
Oh , no , thank you , really . we &apos;ve ...
- it &apos;s getting very late .
- Yes , Mother .
and how was Cambridge when you left it , Master Edward ?
Oh , awfully nice , I suppose . I &apos;m at Oxford , you know . Oh , Oxford .
I &apos;ve never been to Oxford . but my husband has .
haven &apos;t you , George ? Yes .
nice place , Oxford . very antique , if you know what I mean .
sir Robert will be so sorry to hear of Bridges &apos;s illness , Ellen .
ill ? Alf ill ?
what &apos;s the matter with him ?
before you and Annie come , George ...
I was explaining to her ladyship about poor Alfred &apos;s bad leg . - Bad leg ?
- Yes , very bad .
he &apos;s been in horrible agony since Sunday .
you would laugh at someone being hurt .
- Where is he ?
- Upstairs in bed .
- I &apos;ll pop up and have a look at him .
- No , he mustn &apos;t be disturbed . and how did he come to have the accident ? eh ...
cycling , Annie .
he was cycling and he fell off .
I didn &apos;t know he had a cycle .
he hasn &apos;t anymore .
well , please tell him how sorry we are . come , Edward .
we really must be going now .
it was ever so kind of you , milady , to come all this way to see us and to give Fanny that lovely doll and everything .
say good-bye to her ladyship , Fanny .
- Good-bye , milady . - Good-bye , dear .
Good-bye . Good-bye , Annie . I &apos;m so glad you settled down so happily .
pleased to have made your acquaintance , I &apos;m sure . Good-bye , Ellen .
please remember us to Bridges .
- We miss you both still .
- We miss you , too , milady .
well , time changes many things , but it can &apos;t change old friends , can it ?
no , milady . Oh , no , milady .
Good-bye , Ellen , and good luck .
Good-bye , Master Edward , and thank you for coming .
Good-bye . Alfred !
Oh , so this is why you wanted me out of the way , eh ?
Alfred Bridges , behave yourself .
pleased to see you again , milady , I &apos;m sure . welcome to our hovel .
Oh , proud and haughty , are we ?
- Alfred , stop it ! stop it ! - Ellen .
dear Ellen . I &apos;m so very , very sorry .
I quite understand , quite . I &apos;ll come and see you again soon .
you drunken great brute !
you shut your mouth .
you mind your business , and I &apos;ll mind mine . look here , old man .
you better come up - and have a lay down . - Leave me alone !
lot of snobs , that &apos;s what . - Lot of blasted snobs ! - Now !
now !
Oh , I &apos;m not good enough to be at home when the quality comes . Oh , no !
I &apos;ll show you who &apos;s good enough !
I shall never be able to hold my head up again . never !
never !
Oh , who give Fanny that doll ?
her noble ladyship , I suppose .
well , we don &apos;t want none of her blasted charity around here . get out !
come here ! no , let go ! let go !
you &apos;re going upstairs . that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do .
you &apos;re coming right up here . blasted snobs !
she was right . she was right .
time changes many things .
running out of the house like that , swearing before Fanny and hurting my leg .
he needs a lesson , a good lesson . - That &apos;s right , a good lesson .
- All right . that &apos;s all right .
look here , Ellen .
Alf will tell you how sorry he is when he gets back .
Hey , Mrs. Bridges , I think you &apos;d better come .
Alf &apos;s met with an accident .
he hurt bad ?
Yes .
Alf . Alf ! Alf !
ladies and gentlemen ...
and kiddies ...
I am happy to be able to announce to you the winner of this week &apos;s song-and-dance competition .
it is ...
ls ... ls ...
none other than little Miss Fanny Bridges .
come on up here .
it gives me great pleasure to present you with this magnificent prize , a souvenir of Uncle George and His Merry , Merry Men .
and now , ladies and gentlemen , to conclude our program ,
Uncle Dick will sing Take Me Back To Yorkshire .
Edward . - We &apos;re going down on the beach .
- Oh , Lord .
we have to , dear . your father &apos;s going to join us there .
Yes , I know , darling .
he has strong nerves . but he doesn &apos;t need a whole deputation of us to meet him .
Edith and I are going to the concert on the east pier .
concert ? how loathsome .
nobody &apos;s asking you , my little man .
you just take your spade and your bucket and have a nice little paddle .
- Oh , Edward . - Come along , Edith .
you don &apos;t mind , Mummy ?
of course not , darling . do just what you like .
are those two children getting romantic by any chance ?
- Romantic ? they &apos;re absolutely pathetic .
- Oh , Joey , behave .
Oh , but , Mum , can &apos;t you see they &apos;ve gone completely dippy about each other ?
why , it seems only yesterday they were quarreling over their toys in the nursery .
I wonder if Joey &apos;s right .
- Would you mind ?
- Jane , dear , of course not . - Would you ?
- My son and your daughter ? darling , you know I &apos;d be delighted .
well , if we &apos;re ever gonna meet Father ...
- Oh , yes , we mustn &apos;t keep him waiting .
why , Ellen , what a surprise .
Oh , milady , fancy you being here .
- How do you do , Ellen &apos; ?
- How do you do , ma &apos;am ? - Hello , Ellen .
- Oh , Master Joe . Oh , you have grown .
I got your letter , milady , when my Alfred died .
it was kind of you to write , I &apos;m sure .
we were so sorry . - I hope your business affairs are ...
- Oh , quite all right , milady .
I kept on the place .
I left my manager in charge .
we &apos;re just only here to give Fanny a holiday .
she goes to dancing academy now .
she won this prize today for dancing .
- Oh , it &apos;s lovely .
- Not half good enough , if you ask me . - Dances like Pavaliver , that child .
- Dances like who ? Pavaliver , the Russian dancer .
don &apos;t be so ignorant .
Oh , she wants to go on the stage , I suppose . - Oh , Jane darling , there you are .
- Oh , hello , dear . Oh , Sir Robert .
- Why , Ellen , how are you ? - Quite well . thank you , sir .
- Grand . - This is my cousin , Mr. Grainger .
- How do you do ? - And his wife . how are ya ?
I never met you before , - but I met your missus , all right .
- Oh , yes . I don &apos;t think she told me .
why , it was the day poor old Alf popped off .
I do believe you &apos;d rather be at that revolting concert on that peculiarly hideous pier listening to Mendelssohn &apos;s Spring Song or a great beefy contralto singing Sweet And Low .
I adore contraltos . I love Sweet And Low .
and I simply worship Mendelssohn &apos;s Spring Song .
what are your other vices ?
Oh , sitting on boats with cynical young men and looking far out to sea .
Oh , but , Edith , I am not a cynic , only a realist .
look , big steamer .
bearing her precious human freight to the farthest flung outposts of the Empire .
don &apos;t laugh . I &apos;d love to be on board .
wouldn &apos;t you ?
together ? - Perhaps .
- We &apos;ll be seasick . - Hideously .
- Oh , everyone is . - What ?
- Seasick hideously . Horrors .
all the same , I &apos;d risk it .
would you ? together ?
on the loveliest ship in the world .
and the most wonderful honeymoon in the world .
Oh , Edward , darling ...
Edith , I &apos;m so terribly in love with you .
look !
Blériot flying the Channel . he &apos;s done it !
- it &apos;s getting colder , isn &apos;t it &apos; ? - Well , that &apos;s to be expected in mid-ocean .
we &apos;re nearing the banks of Newfoundland .
- Would you like to go in ?
- No . it &apos;s all right .
- Too big , the Atlantic . isn &apos;t it ? - Far too big .
- Ooh , and too deep .
- Oh , much , much too deep . I don &apos;t care a bit .
not a scrap .
wouldn &apos;t it be awful if a magician came to us and said ,
&quot; unless you count , accurately , every single fish in the Atlantic ,
- &quot; you will die tonight . &quot; - We should die tonight ?
how much would you mind ...
dying , I mean ? Oh , I don &apos;t know . a good deal , I expect .
I don &apos;t believe I should mind so very much .
you see , we could never in our whole lives be any happier than we are now .
could we ?
sweetheart .
- Are all honeymoons like this ?
- Exactly .
Oh , Edward . it &apos;s rather disheartening , isn &apos;t it ?
I do so want this to be unique . it is , for us . did you ever think when we were children ,
- going to the pantomime and the zoo ...
- That we should end up by getting married ?
- Mm-hmmm .
- Of course I didn &apos;t .
you were a horrible child .
well , so were you . and so was Joey . vile .
yet we all liked each other , really . dear Joey .
he &apos;s passing gallantly through the chorus girl phase now , isn &apos;t he ? Mm .
gallantly but not quickly .
- Well , darling , you took your time over it .
- Now , Edith . didn &apos;t you ?
light of my life , shut up .
you &apos;d be awfully cross if I &apos;d had affairs .
- If you &apos;d what ?
- Had affairs . love affairs before you .
- You didn &apos;t . - Hundreds . you liar .
I rather wish I had sometimes .
perhaps then I should have learned some tricks to hold you with when you begin to get tired of me .
I shall never do that , tricks or no tricks .
Oh , yes , you will one day .
people always do .
this complete loveliness will fade , and we shall forget what it was like .
- Edith , don &apos;t . - Oh , it &apos;s bound to .
just a few years and the gilt wears off the gingerbread .
darling , answer me one thing truthfully .
have you ever seen gingerbread with gilt on it ?
- Oh , fool ! - Then the whole argument is disposed of .
anyway , look at Father and Mother .
they &apos;re perfectly happy and always have been .
Oh , yes , but they had a better chance in the beginning .
things weren &apos;t changing so swiftly , and life wasn &apos;t so restless .
how long do you give us ?
I don &apos;t know .
Oh , and , Edward , I don &apos;t care .
this is our moment , complete and heavenly .
I &apos;m not afraid of anything .
this is our own , forever .
Oh , dear .
it &apos;ll be 10 : 00 before we get to London .
if we &apos;re held up by many more troop trains , it &apos;ll be tomorrow morning .
- Oh , Joey . - Or next week .
may I see your paper , Robert ?
Hmm ? Oh , of course , my dear .
darling , what &apos;s the matter ? can I help you ?
- No , it &apos;s all right . - Shall I get a taxi , Father ?
- Yes , go ahead , Joey . - All right .
Oh , here they are . Hello , Charlie .
- Mum , where shall I put these bags ?
- Oh , put them anywhere . all right . Oh , really , why does one ever go abroad ?
it &apos;s misery when you &apos;re away , and you come back to this sort of thing .
I &apos;m absolutely dead beat .
no servants , no food in the house , no nothing .
Oh ! I thought that awful journey was never going to end . Oh !
Oh , it was awful , wasn &apos;t it ?
Oh ! come on , Margaret . help me with these abominable things .
Mm-hmm .
what fools we were to start back without making sure of the servants .
well , anyway , it &apos;s much better to be here in London . if anything is going to happen ...
it &apos;s going to happen , all right .
this is a lark , isn &apos;t it ?
I put the bags up ...
- Hello . spring cleaning ?
- Where &apos;s your father ?
Oh , groping about in the cellar , like an angry old beetle .
- He wants a drink . - Hear !
hear ! so do I .
well , I &apos;d better go and see if I can find some biscuits or something .
- Cigarette ? - Oh , thank you , Joe .
- Pretty thrilling , isn &apos;t it ?
- Just a bit too thrilling , my dear .
Oh , rot , Aunt Margaret .
it &apos;s absolutely marvelous .
passing all those supply trains and guns .
being pushed aside to make way for the troops .
the crowds waiting for something to happen .
Oh , it was wonderful .
Jane &apos;s howling for you in the kitchen , Margaret .
Oh , all right .
well , I can &apos;t find anything but Hock .
we &apos;ll have to drink to Germany &apos;s downfall in their own damn wine .
- I rather like Germans .
don &apos;t you , Father ? - Enormously . give me a hand , Joey .
if there is a war , how long do you think it &apos;ll last ?
Oh , three months at the outside .
- We shall win .
- We shall win .
perhaps it &apos;ll last six months .
Economically impossible .
have you any idea what a war costs ?
- Hell of a lot , I suppose .
- Hell of a lot . the Germans can afford it even less than we can .
- Then there &apos;s Russia . - Good ol &apos; Russia .
and France , Italy and America .
Japan , China , Nicaragua , Guatemala . Oh , why , we &apos;ve got &apos; em licked before we start .
- Don &apos;t be silly , Joey . - Sorry .
what &apos;s the time ?
nearly 12 : 00 . is that right ?
well , it oughta be . hasn &apos;t varied a minute in the past 10 years .
it &apos;s all happening now .
short of a miracle , it &apos;s all happened .
are you glad you left the army , or not ?
absolutely delighted .
- Will you go back again ? - I expect so .
- How will you feel about that ? - Absolutely delighted . I suppose I ought to do something about it , too .
- You want to ?
- Terribly .
why ?
I don &apos;t know .
I wish ...
I wish Edward hadn &apos;t been drowned .
we could have started off together .
don &apos;t be too impulsive and patriotic and dashing , Joey .
think of your mother . think of me , too .
found some potted meat and biscuits and Worcester sauce and ... War declared official !
we are at war ! war declared official !
war declared official !
my dears , we &apos;re at war with Germany . no . listen .
listen .
it &apos;s very hot , isn &apos;t it ? don &apos;t look sad , Mum .
it won &apos;t last long .
father says it can &apos;t possibly . and it &apos;s terribly exciting . I feel rather tired .
here , Mum , dear , have a nice sozzle .
we all oughta get drunk , really , and go roaring about the streets .
Edward missed this anyhow .
at least he died when he was happy ...
before the world broke over his head .
Jane darling , we &apos;ve had wars before without the world breaking .
my world isn &apos;t very big .
drink to the war then . I &apos;m not going to . I can &apos;t !
rule Britannia ! send us victorious , happy and glorious .
drink , Joey .
you &apos;re only a baby still , but you &apos;re old enough for war .
drink as the Germans are doing tonight .
to victory and defeat and stupid tragic sorrow . but don &apos;t ask me to do it , please !
those awful recruiting songs again .
you can &apos;t get away from them anywhere in London .
Oh , they give me rather a thrill .
the girls give me a thrill .
I &apos;ll bet that little dark one sung her share of fellas into the war .
by George , I &apos;m excited .
finally leave off to France Saturday . marvelous .
marvelously marvelous .
Oh , good Lord , Ainger , do you mean to say you don &apos;t want to get back &apos; ?
seriously , don &apos;t you feel pretty marvelous ?
I feel pretty thirsty .
well , that &apos;s easily remedied .
uh , waiter .
- Uh , some more wine , please .
- Ah . Oh , it &apos;s a bit of luck , the war coming when it did .
I was properly fed up at Oxford .
Oxford ? I was just starting in an accountant &apos;s office .
well , you &apos;ll probably finish up under the poppies in Flanders .
drink up and have another .
my hat , that girl can dance .
- Who is she &apos; ?
- A kid by the name of Fanny Bridges .
- Fanny Bridges ?
- Yes . know her ?
- Excuse me , old chaps .
- It &apos;s all right . come on . drink up .
I ... Now , don &apos;t be afraid . I say , you &apos;re marvelous .
what are you doing here ?
what are you doing ?
- I was waiting for you . - Waiting ? you don &apos;t mean to say you &apos;ve been here all this time while I ...
Oh , no , no .
I mean , as a matter of fact ...
I say , you are marvelous . - Who are you ?
- One of your oldest friends .
Oh , what a lie . I &apos;ve never seen you before in my life . - Oh , but you have .
- Oh , but I haven &apos;t . Oh , really you have .
we lived under the same roof for years .
Oh , I &apos;m sure this is a very good joke , but I &apos;m awfully busy and ...
- My name &apos;s Joey . - Oh , how interesting .
and I have a dog called Towser . now , do you mind going ?
&apos;Cause I have to finish dressing .
but you don &apos;t remember anyone called Joey when you were a little girl ?
little girl ?
you &apos;re not Joey Marryot ?
Fanny !
isn &apos;t it marvelous ?
take cover ! take cover ! take cover !
- Did you hear that ? - Yes .
air raid .
take cover in the basement .
well , that &apos;s all very well , but where is the basement ?
Oh , never mind the basement . let &apos;s go up on the roof .
Oh , that &apos;s that . I can &apos;t see a thing .
Oh , curse the dark . I &apos;m smashing the room to bits .
what on earth have I got hold of ? feels like a tray of squashed bananas .
thanks . that &apos;s my makeup box . here , we &apos;re missing all the fun .
catch hold of my hand . - That &apos;s better . - This way .
now , don &apos;t fall over . Oh , dear . I can &apos;t see a thing .
Oh . there it is .
Oh , Joey , isn &apos;t it thrilling ? marvelous .
Yes , it &apos;s pretty hard at times ...
all the muck and filth .
and it &apos;s a bit weird when you find yourself the only surviving officer who went out with the battalion .
&apos;Course it may be sort of the law of averages , to make up to Mother for Edward going down on the Titanic .
or perhaps I &apos;m just lucky .
anyway , what &apos;s the good of talking ?
gotta go back tonight .
just one last twinkle .
Oh , my darling , don &apos;t give me any more . I shall be tight .
you don &apos;t want me to fall down during my first number , do you ?
fun , having dinner here , wasn &apos;t it ?
lovely fun , darling . curtain &apos;s up , please .
Oh , heavens . I &apos;m on in five minutes .
will you really write to me tonight ? of course I will .
I promised .
well , you &apos;ll be smothered with people after the show , and you won &apos;t have time .
I &apos;ll write you in the first interval and send Maggie out to post it .
dear old Maggie . darling .
in about one minute , we &apos;ve got to say good-bye .
flowers , miss . Oh , give them to Maggie and tell her to put them in water .
Yes , miss .
don &apos;t go yet , Joey . stay till my first act .
wait . can &apos;t . I promised to go home .
mother &apos;s waiting for me .
- Do stay , darling . - I can &apos;t . really , I can &apos;t .
I &apos;m sorry . of course you can &apos;t . so I &apos;ll give it to you now .
what ?
just a little something I had made for you .
with my love .
Oh , how marvelous .
Oh , it &apos;s nothing . just a reminder of all the fun we &apos;ve had .
you &apos;re a darling .
Oh , but you &apos;ve missed the whole point .
it opens . look .
I &apos;ll keep it ...
forever and ever ... And ever .
Oh , darling , I almost wish I didn &apos;t love you quite so terribly .
it makes going back just a bit too thick somehow .
I shall miss you ... Dreadfully . Miss Bridges , please .
heavens , that &apos;s my call .
it has been fun , hasn &apos;t it ?
heavenly .
and you don &apos;t regret it ?
any of it ?
not a moment . Oh , how wonderful you are .
do you really love me ?
deep down inside , I mean .
of course , I do .
enough to marry me ?
Yes , but I wouldn &apos;t . - Oh , why not ?
- Too difficult .
besides , we shouldn &apos;t be happy married .
- And your mother wouldn &apos;t like it . - She &apos;d be all right .
let &apos;s not talk about it now .
let &apos;s wait until you come back .
- Oh , no . - No .
no , not now , dear .
I see . Miss Bridges , please !
listen , Joey . I love you , and you love me .
and I &apos;ve got to go now . I &apos;m late . and you &apos;ve got to go , too .
but I &apos;m not going to say good-bye . we &apos;ve had fun , grand fun .
and I don &apos;t want you to forget me .
that &apos;s why I gave you the locket .
keep it close to you , Joey .
darling Joey .
Miss Bridges , you &apos;re keeping the stage .
not much time for good-byes .
- I &apos;m glad , really .
aren &apos;t you ?
- Awfully . - I never know what to say .
- I &apos;m almost hardened .
this has happened so often .
dearest Mum , you are wonderful .
you never make a fuss .
don &apos;t be too sweet to me , Joey .
I don &apos;t want to behave badly .
you ? you couldn &apos;t behave badly .
Oh , how funny .
Robert said that to me years and years ago .
&apos;Twas the Boer War then .
this is all so different . Good-bye , dear .
Good-bye , darling .
take care of yourself . try to see your father on the way .
- Yes , if I can . Good-bye . - Good-bye .
- Cigarette ?
- Thanks .
- First time out ?
- Yes , marvelous , isn &apos;t it ?
- Marvelously marvelous .
- Aren &apos;t you glad to be going back ?
terribly .
I thought it was all going to finish before I was old enough to go out .
so did I , once .
- Sorry , I gotta see the RTO . - RTO ? what &apos;s that ?
railway Transport Officer . don &apos;t you know anything ?
- Excuse me , sir . - Yes . what is it ?
returning from leave . first Greenjackets .
staff Sergeant , see about this officer &apos;s train , will you ?
Yes , sir .
may I speak to you a moment ?
I &apos;m fearfully busy . won &apos;t the staff sergeant do ?
I &apos;m afraid not , Father . what the ...
how &apos;d you know I was here ?
- Found out at the base .
- Oh , you young devil .
how &apos;s Mother ?
- Splendid .
- Just about killing herself , I suppose , with war work and all that .
she &apos;s pretty wonderful .
you look pretty tired , too , sir .
well , we &apos;re moving troops very rapidly . enemy &apos;s on the run .
- What did you do with your leave ?
- Oh , I don &apos;t know . lots of things .
- I saw Aunt Margaret .
- Yes . couldn &apos;t dodge it , I suppose ?
- How is she ?
- She &apos;s all right .
- When do you go on leave , sir ?
- Probably never again . good Lord , why ?
because they &apos;re talking about an armistice .
- No .
- Fact .
we may all be home in a few weeks .
train for First Greenjackets , number one platform , five minutes , sir .
five minutes ? I gotta collect my kit .
- Good-bye , Dad . - Good-bye .
good of you to look me up , Joey .
Good-bye .
General Staff Home Command speaking .
&quot; an armistice has been signed and hostilities will cease today
&quot; at 11 : 00 ack-emma .
&quot; at 11 : 00 precisely , the Hyde Park battery will fire a salute of 21 guns .
&quot; and the officer in charge of mortars will let off a salvo of maroons .
&quot; written orders will follow .
&quot; officers will now proceed to synchronize watches . &quot;
are you ready ?
her ladyship will not keep you a moment , madam . much obliged , I &apos;m sure .
why , Ellen .
my maid said , &quot; Mrs. Bridges . &quot; it never occurred to me that it was you .
Yes , I just thought I &apos;d call .
it &apos;s rather important , as a matter of fact .
do sit down .
I &apos;m delighted to see you again . thank you .
- How &apos;s Fanny ?
- Oh , very well . she &apos;s in Over the Moon now , you know .
it &apos;s about her I &apos;ve come to see you , really .
Oh . well ?
well , it &apos;s rather difficult .
Oh , what &apos;s the matter ?
about her and Master ...
her and Joe .
- Joe &apos; ?
- Yes , Joe . they &apos;ve been having a ...
well , to put it frankly , if you know what I mean ...
they &apos;ve been having an affair .
his last two leaves he &apos;s spent a lot of time with her .
I wouldn &apos;t have come to see you about it at all , only ...
well , I think Fanny &apos;s very upset about it .
now that the war is over and he &apos;ll be coming home , I thought that ... - What did you think ?
- I thought they ought to get married .
does she want to marry him ?
no , not exactly .
that is ...
Oh , well , I haven &apos;t talked about it to her .
she doesn &apos;t know I know . - How do you know ?
- Found a letter from him .
- And you read it ?
- Yes . I &apos;ve got it here . - I brought it with me .
- I don &apos;t wish to see it , thank you .
Oh , but I only brought it because I thought you might ...
tell me , is Fanny in any sort of trouble ?
Oh , no , nothing like that .
tsk , tsk , tsk .
I think we &apos;d better wait until Joe comes home . then they can decide .
well . I &apos;m sure I didn &apos;t wish to upset you .
I &apos;m not in the least upset .
but it &apos;s been on my mind . it &apos;s been worrying me to death .
I think you should have spoken to your daughter before you came to see me .
I never interfere with my son &apos;s affairs .
I &apos;m sure I &apos;m ever so sorry .
please , don &apos;t let &apos;s discuss it any further .
Good-bye , Ellen .
Oh , I suppose you imagine that my daughter isn &apos;t good enough to marry your son .
well , if that &apos;s the case , I can assure you you &apos;re very much mistaken .
Fanny &apos;s received everywhere .
she knows all the best people .
how nice for her . I wish I did .
things aren &apos;t what they used to be , you know . - No , it &apos;s all changing &apos; .
- Yes , I see it is .
but Fanny &apos;s at the top of her tree now .
she &apos;s having the most wonderful offers .
- Oh , Ellen ! - What is it ?
I &apos;m so very , very sorry .
I don &apos;t know what you mean .
Oh , yes , you do . inside , you must .
something seems to have gone out of all of us , and I ...
I &apos;m not sure that I like what &apos;s left .
Good-bye , Ellen .
I don &apos;t know why you should talk like that .
some of us have got on in their world , and some of us haven &apos;t .
I said , &quot; Good-bye , Ellen . &quot;
Yes , what is it ?
it &apos;s all over , milady .
the maroons are going off .
excuse me .
there &apos;s no answer .
what is it ? what &apos;s happened ?
you needn &apos;t worry about Fanny and Joe .
he won &apos;t be able to come back . he &apos;s ...
dead .
Oh , your ladyship .
Oh , milady .
why are we here in Geneva ?
to bear witness to the truth that if the world war is to be crowned by peace , the world must disarm .
all efforts to appoint this paramount ... You talk of disarmament , but where is it ?
what defense does it offer ?
but this poison gas gives us security .
what &apos;s all this talk about balancing the budget ?
the whole world &apos;s broke . we &apos;re all broke .
the whole thing is a heartless mockery .
after centuries of investigation , it comes to this .
God is a superstition too crude to impose upon a child .
we abandon the primitive yearning of a savage for an object of worship
- and focus instead ...
- We are all free to join the scramble for power and riches , and to sell our beliefs to buy success .
but each of us must one day face an awful question that is echoing down through the ages .
what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world ?
introducing Miss Fanny Bridges and her new song hit .
but , Jane dear , I like jazz .
I don &apos;t see the sense in sitting , waiting for the grave .
Oh , I &apos;m not waiting for anything . I have a perfectly good time .
I go to the opera . I go to theaters .
I go to the zoo .
so far , I must say , I found the zoo infinitely the most entertaining . really , Jane dear , you &apos;re quite hopeless .
well , I refuse to be jostled about it .
all this jazz and whizzing about .
no wonder you &apos;re always in the clutches of a new doctor . now , dear , I don &apos;t think it &apos;s quite fair to say that .
he &apos;s the most wonderful man I &apos;ve ever met .
and he has the most marvelous touch .
he &apos;s completely cured me .
cured you of what , darling ?
Oh , of my ailment .
well , I &apos;m perfectly comfortable where I am ...
without taking cures for ailments I haven &apos;t got .
Yes , but how do you know you haven &apos;t got any ailments ?
because I &apos;m sane and active and as strong as a horse .
so is Robert . - It &apos;s nearly time , milady .
- Oh , put it on the coffee table . good heavens !
I must fly .
I wouldn &apos;t interfere with your little ritual for the world .
Oh , my dear , you wouldn &apos;t interfere .
- You &apos;re an old friend .
- Oh , that &apos;s very sweet of you , Jane dear . all the same , I must go .
why , I &apos;m late as it is .
- Oh , going already , Margaret ?
- Yes , Robert .
why , I promised to be at the embassy at half past 11 : 00 .
and now don &apos;t forget that you &apos;re both dining with me on Tuesday .
Oh , my dear , how can we , if you &apos;re going to Paris on Monday ?
Oh , but I shall be flying back in the afternoon .
flying ?
she would . now , Robert , don &apos;t bother to come down .
- Nonsense .
of course I will .
- No , no , no , I insist .
- Now , I can easily let myself out .
- Very well .
and a happy New Year to you .
- Bless you both . - Good night , dear .
the same to you .
twice over .
well , Robert , here we go again .
one more year behind us .
one more year before us . - Do you mind ? - No .
everything passes , even time .
that means you do .
and you don &apos;t ?
I still believe in the future .
Ah , that &apos;s your strength , my dear .
I believe in the future , too , but not quite in the same way .
it &apos;s been quite an adventure , our life together .
a great adventure , Robert .
anxious sometimes and sad .
sometimes unbelievably happy .
but thank God , never dull or sordid .
and most of it has come to us in this house ...
- In this very room . - Yes .
sometimes I &apos;ve almost hated it .
- You wouldn &apos;t move ?
- Oh , my dear , of course not .
well , we might have some new curtains , of course .
- We have , dear . - Hmm ?
have we ?
Oh , so we have . I never noticed .
- They &apos;ve only been up a week . - Oh ! dear Robert .
in one minute , it will be 1933 .
well , Robert , what toast have you in mind for tonight ?
- Something gay and original , I hope .
- No , just the future . our old friend , the future ... The future of England .
but first of all , my dear ...
I drink to you .
and I drink to you , Robert .
loyal and loving , always .
now , let &apos;s couple the future of England with the past of England ...
the glories , the victories , the triumphs that are over .
and the sorrows that are over , too .
let us drink to our sons who made part of the pattern .
and to our hearts that died with them .
let us drink to the spirit of gallantry and courage that made a strange heaven out of unbelievable hell .
and let us drink to the hope that one day this country of ours , which we love so much , will find dignity and greatness and peace again .
dignity ... Greatness and peace .
&#91; conductor &#93; En voiture !
- Bonjour . - Bonjour .
&#91; woman &#93; Bonjour !
alors , vous trouvez que ça me ressemble ?
tout à fait .
- J &apos;ai I &apos;air aussi bête que ça ? - J &apos;en ai peur .
Voyons , Mademoiselle , regardez ce nez !
c &apos;est le votre . J &apos;y peux rien .
Enfin , passons pour moi .
mais alors , lui .
vous I &apos;avez bien arrangé .
mais ce n &apos;est pas sa tête , ce n &apos;est pas son crâne .
d &apos;où je suis , c &apos;est tout à fait ça !
son maxillaire supérieur n &apos;est pas aussi prominent .
Au contraire , c &apos;est ce qui ressort le plus .
- Et le menton ? - Exactement le sien !
- Trop accentué ! - Je le vois comme ça .
et puis comprenez , monsieur , que ceci est une caricature ... et dites-vous bien que le but d &apos;un dessin ou d &apos;une peinture ... n &apos;est pas de reproduire une vulgaire photographie ... mais de faire ressortir les caractéristiques d &apos;un fasciès ... vues selon la personnalité de I &apos;artiste , même en les exagérant .
Oh , nuts !
well , baby , the name is Curtis .
- May I present Thomas B. Chambers . - My name is Gilda Farrell .
- Coming back to the subject of art - - Are you a painter ?
- Yes . - What did you say your name was ?
- Curtis . - George Curtis ?
Yes .
you exhibited a painting at the Shale Galleries .
- True . - Let me see .
- Oh , Lady Godiva , wasn &apos;t it ? - &#91; Chuckles &#93; Did you like it ?
I saw it with a friend of mine . she loved it .
we haven &apos;t spoken since .
I , uh -
I wouldn &apos;t consider her one of your greatest admirers .
- Are you a painter too ? - Oh , no , no . not me .
I &apos;m a playwright .
I write unproduced plays . and very good of that kind .
- Why didn &apos;t you like my picture ? - It &apos;s smart-aleck .
you &apos;re wisecracking with paint .
it simply creaks with originality .
lady Godiva riding a bicycle !
I know what she means .
a bicycle seat is a little hard on Lady Godiva &apos;s historical background .
shut up !
I see .
lady Godiva doesn &apos;t belong on a bicycle ... but it &apos;s okay to put Napoleon ... in a Kaplan and McGuire non-wrinkling , 2.50 union suit .
quite right . that &apos;s not history .
and if I may say so , they , uh - they do wrinkle .
I &apos;m a commercial artist .
I &apos;m being paid for telling the world that if Napoleon were alive today ... he would wear Kaplan and McGuire &apos;s 2.50 , non-wrinkling underwear .
pure hooey .
you &apos;re wasting your time painting for art galleries .
you should get in contact with some bicycle manufacturer .
you &apos;d clean up .
I &apos;ll give you a good slogan :
&quot; join Lady Godiva on our tandem . &quot;
don &apos;t say &quot; nuts . &quot; not to a lady .
- Hurry up , Gilda ! - Shake a leg !
it &apos;s amazing how a few insults can bring people together in three hours .
it was certainly good to hear all the names you called me .
I haven &apos;t heard &apos; em since I left Father and Mother .
what we want to know is , do you like us better than Kaplan and McGuire ?
let me tell you , Curtis and Chambers deliver the goods .
- &#91; Whistle Blows &#93; - &#91; Conductor &#93; En voiture !
En voiture !
- Max ! - Gilda ! darling !
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s Kaplan .
I doubt if it &apos;s McGuire .
and it &apos;s certainly not Napoleon .
&#91; typing &#93;
- Take a letter ! - &#91; Lisping &#93; Yes , sir .
my dear Mr. Thomas B. Chambers .
uh , cross that out .
Mr. Chambers .
Comma . paragraph .
I am writing you in regard to your undesirable attentions to Miss Gilda Farrell .
Hello . Yes .
no , no , no , that won &apos;t do at all .
I want the copy to read exactly as I laid it out .
&quot; the real aristocrat surrenders to Murphy Hold &apos; Em Up Suspenders . &quot;
and put &quot; Hold &apos; Em Up &quot; in a brighter color .
A-And listen , put that French touch in the suspenders .
where was I ?
&#91; Lisping &#93; Undesirable attention to Miss Gilda Farrell .
I &apos;m afraid , Bassington , that you are wrong .
I &apos;m afraid , Bassington , that you are wr -
I &apos;m afraid , Bassington ... that you are right ... but nonetheless boring .
&#91; Chuckles &#93; Very good .
very good .
- Bassington curls his lips foolishly ... and crosses to left .
Bassington speaks :
there &apos;s only one thing I have to say to you .
what could he say ?
there &apos;s only one thing I have to say to you .
- &#91; Knocking &#93; - Come in , come in .
there &apos;s only one thing I have to say to you .
Ah , Plunkett , Incorporated !
well , welcome to Bohemia , sir .
- How do you do ? - Why , I &apos;m getting on , sir , in my modest way .
- And you ? - I &apos;m well , thank you .
you &apos;re looking splendid .
that &apos;s a fetching tie , Mr. Plunkett . and these spats - very exciting .
what an ensemble , hmm ?
but personally , I don &apos;t like derbies .
they give a man that undertaker look .
my dear Mr. Chambers , I have come here to speak to you man to man .
my favorite type of conversation .
I wish to broach a rather delicate subject .
Oh , now , don &apos;t let &apos;s be delicate , Mr. Plunkett . let &apos;s be crude and objectionable , both of us .
one of the greatest handicaps to civilization , and I may say to progress ... is the fact that people speak with ribbons on their tongues .
delicacy , as the philosophers point out ... is the , uh , banana peel under the feet of truth .
and , uh , if you &apos;ve come up here to raise a fuss about Gilda ... this derby is a thing of the past .
Mr. Chambers , I -
Mr. Chambers , I don &apos;t wish you to misunderstand me .
I am not Miss Farrell &apos;s husband , nor her fiancé in any shape , form or manner .
Hmm . I see . her devoted friend .
- Yes . for five years . - Mm-hmm .
- Her guide , I take it , and counselor . - Yes .
- Her protector . - Exactly .
Mm-hmm . in other words , Mr. Plunkett , you , uh - you never got to first base .
Yes -
- I &apos;ll overlook that insult . - Thank you .
will you be seated ?
Mr. Chambers , your attentions to Gilda are undesirable .
- Has she been complaining ? - No .
well , good , good . I &apos;m very busy , Mr. Plunkett .
I , uh - I &apos;m creating .
Mr. Chambers , there &apos;s only one thing I have to say to you .
- Do you know what it is ? - Yes .
Immorality may be fun ... but it isn &apos;t fun enough to take the place of 100 % virtue and three square meals a day .
now , wait a minute .
Immorality may be fun -
but it isn &apos;t fun enough to take the place -
- Of 100 % virtue - - And three square meals a day .
- Superb ! - Furthermore -
Ah-ah !
not another word !
Th-That &apos;s a curtain .
three square meals a day ... and Bassington exits .
Mr. Chambers -
listen to me , Plunkett , Incorporated .
I &apos;m in love with Gilda . I adore her . I &apos;m quite insane about her .
I love you , Gilda .
Oh , that &apos;s sweet to hear .
Gilda , sometimes I wonder what I see in you .
you don &apos;t appreciate me , and you know nothing about art .
maybe you love me because I &apos;m an imbecile .
it must be something like that .
I really love you .
I &apos;m amazed at myself .
it &apos;s sincere . that &apos;s what gets my goat .
Gilda .
I &apos;m very fond of you .
Oh . you &apos;re fond of me , huh ?
Mm-hmm .
I don &apos;t like that .
I know what &apos;s the trouble .
I swear I &apos;ll break his neck !
Gilda , you &apos;re mine ! tell him to get out of your life and stay out or I &apos;ll cut him to bits !
- Who ? - That pal of yours , Max Plunkett .
well , what &apos;s the verdict ?
are you jealous ?
no . no , I &apos;m not jealous .
the whole point is that I just don &apos;t want any competition .
it belittles me in my own eyes . it - It interferes with my work .
I - I can &apos;t paint when I &apos;m worried .
all right . I &apos;ll tell Max .
see that you do . understand ?
Yes , sir .
Gilda .
now please go . I &apos;ll see you tomorrow .
tomorrow my life begins !
- Hello , Mr. Plunkett . - Hello .
Oh ! Mr. Curtis .
- How are you ? - I &apos;m well , thank you .
- Good night , Mr. Plunkett . - Uh , just a minute .
what are you doing here ?
- At the moment I am leaving . - I mean , you &apos;ve seen Miss Farrell ?
Yes , I &apos;ve seen Gilda .
- Well ! - She &apos;s expecting you .
she has some news for you .
Mr. Curtis , I wish to , uh , broach a rather delicate matter .
it concerns Gilda .
sit down .
shoot !
Mr. Curtis ... what is your annual income , in round figures ?
in round figures ... zero .
- May I ask what you live on ? - Nothing .
I survive by miracles .
Mr. Curtis , I must ask you man to man to discontinue your attentions to Gilda .
now you &apos;re making very unbecoming faces , Mr. Plunkett .
- She doesn &apos;t need you . - Guess again !
Mr. Curtis , there &apos;s only one thing I have to say to you .
Immorality may be fun , but it isn &apos;t fun enough to take the place of 100 % virtue ... and three square meals a day .
so !
this is the way you talk to a man who wears Kaplan and McGuire union suits .
Mr. Plunkett , I shall report you to your clients immediately .
good night , sir .
- Yesterday it was Tom . - Yes ?
- Today it &apos;s George . - Yes ?
okay .
Hoodlums .
artistic bums .
both of &apos; em put together aren &apos;t worth a dime .
Gilda , no one knows better than you how unselfish I &apos;ve been ... in all matters pertaining to you .
- You &apos;ve been nice . - I &apos;ve been marvelous .
no , just nice .
Gilda , I &apos;ve been your friend for five years -
and I want you to remain my friend for the next 50 years , so please shut up .
Max , have you ever been in love ?
this is no time to answer that .
have you ever felt your brain catch fire ... and a curious , dreadful thing go right through your body ... down , down to your very toes ... and leave you with your ears ringing ?
that &apos;s abnormal .
well , that &apos;s how I felt just before you came in .
Yes ? how &apos;d you feel yesterday after your promenade with Tom ?
just the opposite .
it started in my very toes and came up , up , up very slowly ... until my brain caught fire .
but the ringing in the ears was the same .
Hello .
&#91; Tom &#93; Hello .
did you go for the laundry ?
hardly .
why not ?
two cans of sardines , five francs .
Madame Poperino , blackmail , seven francs 50 .
- No laundry . - That &apos;s fine .
I haven &apos;t got a clean shirt to my name .
clean shirt ?
what &apos;s up , a romance ?
I &apos;m not talking about pajamas .
I &apos;m talking about a clean shirt .
I don &apos;t want to go around looking like a rag picker .
I &apos;m talking about a white shirt , a shirt without a spot , without any holes ... that won &apos;t fall apart when you unbutton your coat .
how old is the laundress ?
Oh , she &apos;s about 45 .
a young 45 ?
Oh , I don &apos;t know .
she goes barefoot .
she &apos;s , uh , rather plump , a little soapy ... but a very interesting mustache .
very charming , very charming . not my type .
mustache or no mustache , I need a clean shirt for tomorrow .
end of Act One .
curtain .
don &apos;t read it . I know it by heart .
you remember where Bassington has found out that Edgar was the man on the fire escape ?
- All right , shoot ! - &quot; There &apos;s a pause .
- Edgar smiles maddeningly . &quot; - Go on , go on !
&quot; Bassington plays with his beard in order to cover his emotion .
Edgar speaks . &#91; clears Throat &#93;
&apos;I &apos;m afraid , Bassington , that you are right , but nonetheless boring . &apos;
Bassington studies his fingernails like a man of the world , crosses to left .
Edgar continues strumming his mandolin .
Bassington , resuming with his beard -
&apos;I have only one thing to say to you .
Immortality may be fun ... but it &apos;s not fun enough to take the place of 100 % virtue ... and three square meals a day . &quot; &apos;
what &apos;s the matter ?
- So ! double-crossing me , huh ? - What are you buzzing about ?
you didn &apos;t write that speech alone , and I know where you got it !
- Well , if you think - - And don &apos;t try to lie out of it !
he was in here - Mr. Plunkett .
and it isn &apos;t difficult to guess why he was here either .
so you &apos;ve been making love to Gilda .
- Now , listen , if you - - I know !
&quot; 100 % virtue and three square meals a day ! &quot;
wait a minute .
so you &apos;ve heard that speech before !
where did you hear that speech before ?
Oh , I see .
clean shirt , eh ?
- So he caught you with Gilda . - It &apos;s a lie ! he didn &apos;t catch me .
very pretty work . true blue George .
look who &apos;s talking about true blue ! I oughta bust you right in that ugly pan of yours !
let &apos;s behave like civilized people .
it &apos;s quite apparent beyond any question ... that you behaved in this matter as a rather common , ordinary rat .
I &apos;m leaving .
where &apos;s my suitcase ?
or have you sold it to somebody ?
this is a little silly , after 11 years of friendship .
you should have considered that earlier !
do you mind a personal question ?
not at all .
are you pretty hard hit ?
that &apos;s none of your business .
- And you ? - Likewise .
what a pity we had to fall in love with the same girl .
charming , isn &apos;t she ?
rather .
nice eyes .
of a sort .
well , I guess we &apos;re through .
looks like it .
curious to have a little bit of feminine fluff breaking up our friendship .
sad .
quite a dilemma .
I wonder if she &apos;s worth it .
I wonder .
in fact , I doubt it .
there &apos;s only one thing we know about her - she &apos;s full of deceit .
- She &apos;s trying to hang it on both of us . - We shouldn &apos;t let her get away with it .
- She &apos;s a troublemaker . - We ought to put our foot down .
you &apos;re right . we oughtn &apos;t to let her break it up .
I &apos;ve been listening to these half-witted dramas of yours for 11 years !
Yes , and I &apos;ve grown cockeyed looking at those humpty-dumpty pictures of yours .
and we should give up all this on account of some girl we met on a train ?
- Third class ! - No woman &apos;s worth it .
absolutely not .
no more clean shirts ?
- We ignore her , 50-50 . - Fine .
- Sacrifice helps an artist . - Exactly !
the sorrows of life are the joys of art .
- I don &apos;t think we ought to discuss her anymore . - Right .
if , uh , the occasion arises which requires our mentioning her at all ... we &apos;ll refer to her as , uh , Miss Farrell .
- It &apos;ll make the whole thing more impersonal . - Exactly .
Hey , George , did you really sell my suitcase ?
Yeah .
okay .
&#91; woman &#93; Monsieur Chambers ou Monsieur Curtis . Au téléphone !
telephone ?
well , um - Oh . answer it if you wish .
go ahead . I trust you .
Oh , thanks .
- Merci beaucoup . - De rien .
Hello ?
Yes ?
well , uh , just a second .
it &apos;s , uh - It &apos;s Miss Farrell .
what do you want , Gilda ?
I beg your pardon .
I see .
I-I see .
well , just a second , please .
- She wants to come up tomorrow . - Tell her absolutely no .
okay .
uh , well -
uh , well , hold the wire .
Miss Farrell &apos;s a little late .
it hardly matters .
I think we ought to be polite .
I &apos;m going to assume a very nonchalant attitude .
don &apos;t forget . nonchalant .
vous êtes bien Monsieur Curtis et Monsieur Chambers ?
oui .
je les ai trouvés . Ils habitent ici .
- Au cinquième . - Merci bien .
- How do you do ?
- How do you do ?
how do you do ?
Tommy , you &apos;re such a child .
I &apos;m so nervous .
couldn &apos;t we all be a little bit more nonchalant ?
I came here to make a confession - a confession hard to make at 11 : 00 in the morning .
&#91; Gilda &#93; George .
Yes , please ?
sit down here .
&#91; Mutters &#93; Well -
- Shall I leave the room ? - No , please !
George . dear George .
when I let you make love to me yesterday , I didn &apos;t tell you something .
I didn &apos;t tell you that the day before , Tom and I had -
did he tell you ?
no .
- Thank you , Tommy . - You &apos;re very welcome .
George , promise me you won &apos;t start smashing furniture .
I &apos;m more than fond of Tommy .
- I &apos;m sorry , old man . - Quite all right .
- Thank you . - Okay !
but -
Tom , when we were in the park - Do you remember ?
- Very well . - I didn &apos;t tell you .
that morning I made a date with George for the next evening in my house ... and I didn &apos;t call it off .
- And I want to be truthful . I - - Oh , I see .
in other words , you &apos;re very fond of George .
more than fond .
a thing happened to me that usually happens to men .
you see , a man can meet two , three , or even four women ... and fall in love with all of them ... and then , by a process of , uh , interesting elimination ... he &apos;s able to decide which one he prefers .
but a woman must decide purely on instinct , guesswork , if she wants to be considered nice .
Oh , it &apos;s quite all right for her to try on a hundred hats before she picks one out , but -
very fine . but which chapeau do you want , madam ?
both .
you see , George , you &apos;re sort of like a ragged straw hat ... with a very soft lining .
a little bit out of shape ... very dashing to look at ... and very comfortable to wear .
and you , Tom .
chic , piquant , perched over one eye ... and has to be watched on windy days .
and both so becoming .
Oh , I &apos;m the most unhappy woman in the world !
poor girl . she &apos;s in rather a tough spot .
George .
dear George , there &apos;s no use pretending you could make me forget Tom .
- I &apos;d miss him . - You would not .
but for the sake of argument , okay .
and , Tom , if I went with you up hill and down dale ... he would haunt me like a bogeyman .
it &apos;s a pitiful situation .
well , if it &apos;ll make you happy , I &apos;m willing to step out .
never mind the grandstand gesture ! I know how you &apos;d step out - with a club .
on the other hand , if you feel that you can &apos;t get along without her ... it wouldn &apos;t be the first sacrifice I &apos;ve made for you .
what sacrifice ? what have you ever done for me ?
look who &apos;s talking ! little Rollo !
why , you &apos;re the most self-centered , egotistical , double-crosser I ever knew !
- Now , listen , if I - - Shh ! there you have it .
you hate him , he hates you , and you both end up by hating me .
boys , let &apos;s sit down .
now let &apos;s talk it over from every angle without any excitement ... like a disarmament conference .
Bonsoir , messieurs . Qu &apos;est-ce que ces messieurs désirent pour dîner ?
le pain de veau est délicieux .
les côtelettes de mouton sont fraîchement cuites , et les pieds de cochon sont merveilleux .
merveilleux !
Très piquants !
uh , trois frankfurters .
Ah , bon . Très bien , messieurs , tout de suite .
well ? what do you think ?
I think it can be worked out , providing -
Yes , you &apos;re right .
&quot; providing . &quot;
- Voila , messieurs . - Merci .
Merci bien , messieurs .
well , boys , it &apos;s the only thing we can do . let &apos;s forget sex .
okay . agreed .
- It may be a bit difficult in the beginning . - But it can be worked out .
- Oh , it &apos;ll be grand ! - Save lots of time .
and confusion .
we &apos;re going to concentrate on work .
your work . my work doesn &apos;t count .
I think both you boys have a great deal of talent , but too much ego .
you spend one day working and a whole month bragging .
gentlemen , there are going to be a few changes .
I &apos;m going to jump up and down on your ego .
I &apos;m going to criticize your work with a baseball bat .
I &apos;m going to tell you every day how bad your stuff is until you get something good ... and if it &apos;s good , I &apos;m going to tell you it &apos;s rotten till you get something better .
I &apos;m going to be a mother of the arts .
no sex .
- Uh-huh . - Oh , no .
it &apos;s a gentleman &apos;s agreement .
rotten , eh ?
listen , my dear girl , when it comes to playwriting , you don &apos;t know your - your dear little elbow from a barrel of flour .
the third act is marvelous . I &apos;ve never written anything better .
it &apos;s rotten .
fortunately , I know that intellectually you &apos;re still in rompers .
you should have realized by now , my dear , that I hate stupidity masquerading as criticism .
rotten .
so I &apos;ve had enough of that . you &apos;re ruining me . you &apos;re ruining my work .
you &apos;re just being cheap and malicious .
rotten .
very well . it &apos;s the last time you &apos;re going to tell me that .
Good-bye , my dear .
- It was a complete flop in London . - I &apos;m sorry , but I don &apos;t ag -
- Forgive me for entering unannounced .
- Mr. Douglas is very busy . - So they were kind enough to tell me downstairs .
- Mr. Douglas ? - Yes ?
Mr. Douglas , I consider you the greatest theatrical producer in London .
- I - - In fact , in the world .
my dear young lady , what precisely do you want ?
well , I &apos;ve read your list of productions for the next London season .
- Yes ? - They &apos;re very bad .
but believe me , there &apos;s no need for you to despair .
the situation isn &apos;t entirely black , Mr. Douglas .
have you ever heard of a playwright called Thomas Chambers ?
no , never !
you &apos;ve never read a play called Good Night , Bassington ?
heavens , no ! never !
well , here it is . read it . I &apos;m sure you &apos;ll adore it .
it &apos;s a woman &apos;s play .
Good-bye .
those faking art dealers !
Peanut brains !
Parasites !
- Maybe he &apos;s right . maybe they are - - No , they are not !
- I don &apos;t know , Gilda . - Well , I know . those paintings are great .
- And don &apos;t let anybody tell you they aren &apos;t . - Three of them have .
well , they &apos;re all fools . they &apos;ll be breaking their necks to get hold of your work .
- Maybe when I &apos;m dead . - Stop it !
if you can &apos;t believe in yourself , believe in me .
I &apos;m no good . it &apos;s getting obvious .
George , you &apos;re a fine painter . you &apos;re an artist . you &apos;re going to be one of the great ones .
and if you lie down in the middle of the road , I &apos;ll hate you !
well , friends ... the gentleman addressing you ... is none other than the illustrious Mr. Thomas B. Chambers ... the new dramatic thunderbolt of the London theater .
good Night , Bassington ... has been accepted .
- You don &apos;t mean it ! - Did you sign the contract ?
in letters of fire .
one hundred pounds advance .
it &apos;s colossal !
- The Bank of England . - Uh-huh .
- That &apos;s a good bank , huh ? - It &apos;s the best !
by the way , Gilda , I , uh -
I neglected to mention ...
I &apos;m supposed to go to London .
- To London ? - Tonight .
uh , Mr. Douglas seems to think that I might be of great help during rehearsals .
you know , half the play depends on someone -
bringing out its brittle quality . Oh , yes .
what do you think ? should I go ?
Oh , well , you could do a lot in London , no doubt about that .
and it would help the publicity , of course .
but on the other hand if you stayed here , you could finish your new play .
and yet you might make some valuable connections in London .
but I &apos;m just wondering if you could do as good work in the midst of all that hullabaloo ... as you could if you stayed here .
- Oh , well , Tom , I - - Aw , Gilda .
I couldn &apos;t do good work anywhere without you , and you know it .
and if there should be any curtain calls after that third act , how could I take the bows alone ?
you &apos;re nice , Tom .
I &apos;m not going .
well , drop me a line from London , old boy , will you ?
- Righto ! - &#91; Chuckles &#93; Right !
step a little more forward , Mr. Chambers .
that &apos;s it . smile , please .
- Take off your hat , Mr. Douglas . - Oh ! &#91; Chuckles &#93;
that &apos;s it . hold it !
well , in five weeks you &apos;ll be taking the same train ... and the three of us &apos;ll sit in the royal box at the opening .
&#91; conductor &#93; En voiture !
En voiture !
- Good-bye , boy . - Good-bye , pal .
Good-bye , Gilda .
keep that old typewriter of mine booted and spurred .
- I will . - &#91; Whistle Blowing &#93;
so long .
you &apos;ve had enough today .
please .
okay , teacher .
I &apos;ll have to sew a button on there .
Gilda ...
I &apos;m a pretty gloomy guy tonight .
I have an idea I &apos;m going to be rather bad company .
why don &apos;t you -
why don &apos;t you go out to a movie or something ?
Tarzan is playing at the Adelphia Theatre .
go on , like a good girl .
everything seems different , doesn &apos;t it ?
you &apos;d better go , Gilda , to Tarzan .
I fancy this , uh - what you might call tension ... would keep up for some weeks .
wouldn &apos;t it be wiser if I moved to a hotel ?
Yes , ma &apos;am .
I love you , Gilda . why lie about it ?
you can &apos;t change love by shaking hands with somebody .
we &apos;re unreal , the three of us , trying to play jokes on nature .
this is real .
a million times more honest than all the art in the world .
I love you .
it &apos;s true we have a gentleman &apos;s agreement ... but unfortunately I am no gentleman .
my dearest Gilda and dear George .
this is the first letter I &apos;ve ever dictated ... so kindly overlook its correct spelling and perfect punctuation .
an honest heart still beats beneath .
Exclamation point , dash , paragraph .
well , pals , you &apos;ll be interested to know ... that all London is agog with my wit and charm .
Underline &quot; charm . &quot;
period .
lady Upterdyke , weight 203 ringside ... has smuggled me into her cage of trained social lions .
here I am on exhibition nightly ... up to my neck in duchesses .
period .
the play , by the way , is in its second week of rehearsals ... and looks hotsy-totsy .
I beg your pardon , sir . &quot; hotsy-totsy &quot; ?
Yes , hotsy-totsy .
and yet , dear friends , these triumphs leave me sad .
in the midst of all this pomp and glitter ...
I always remember that our play was written ... on that old Remington Number 2 typewriter ... and on a never-to-be-forgotten diet of frankfurters .
sir ?
- My heart is in the highlands of Montmartre . - &#91; Knocking &#93;
and the - Come in . and the night finds me pale and thoughtful , waiting -
and the night finds me pale and thoughtful ... waiting for the end of my exile when the three of us ...
Athos , Porthos and Mademoiselle d &apos;Artagnan ... will sit in the royal box at the opening -
start the letter over .
dear George and Gilda :
good luck .
as ever , Tom .
- &#91; Together &#93; Good evening , Mr. Chambers . - Good evening . good evening .
- Good evening , Mr. Chambers . - Good evening .
- How &apos;s the house tonight ? - Completely sold out .
- Advance sale ? - Colossal !
- Audience behaving ? - Angelic .
- Applauding ? - Terrific .
thanks .
- How are the programs selling tonight ? - Enormous !
- Busy ? - Tremendous .
&#91; Bassington &#93; And what were you doing on the fire escape ?
- &#91; Edgar &#93; Cooling off . - &#91; Audience Laughing &#93;
&#91; Bassington &#93; And what was your mandolin doing in my bed ?
&#91; Edgar &#93; I must ask you to leave my mandolin out of this .
&#91; Bassington &#93; Edgar , I have only one thing to say to you .
Immorality may be fun , but not fun enough ... to take the place of 100 % virtue and three square meals a day !
- That &apos;s the funniest show , I think . don &apos;t you ? - You like that actor ?
&#91; man &#93; I really enjoyed that show very much .
- How do you do , Mr. Plunkett ? - How do you do ?
- Oh , Mr. Chambers ! - &#91; Chuckles &#93; Yes ?
well , hello .
that &apos;s a very funny play you &apos;ve got in there , in spots .
thank you . thank you . how
Oh , great . fine . advertising going bigger than ever .
- The French are getting billboard crazy . - I see . Hmm .
and how - how &apos;s Paris otherwise ?
- Oh , you don &apos;t know what happened . - No . what ?
well , it &apos;s , uh , quite a story .
the , uh , French government objected to showing Napoleon in union suits .
well , I was up against it for a while , but I changed it ... to Julius Caesar .
I &apos;ll tell you something - outsold Napoleon 2-to-1 .
- Hmm . - Just goes to show .
anything - Anything else going on in Paris ?
Mmm , no . no .
well , I &apos;m glad I ran into you . Yes . pretty good play for the money .
Oh , Mr. Chambers . I almost forgot . best regards from George and Gilda .
Oh , thanks , thanks . how is George ?
we &apos;re friends .
as you know , at first I was inclined to withhold my approval of the whole thing ... but you know how much I like Gilda .
it &apos;s true I didn &apos;t get to first base , but lots of other people didn &apos;t either .
Yeah . &#91; Chortling &#93;
uh , is George , uh - Is George getting - getting along nicely ?
Oh , great , great . he painted me . a portrait , from here up .
- Hmm . - That put him over in the art world . Yes , sir .
and , uh , how - how is Gilda ?
fine . when they first broached the project of painting me , I put my foot down , but Gilda -
- How-How is she ? - Fine .
turned out to be a great painting . it &apos;s a masterpiece .
looks exactly like me . it &apos;s called &quot; Man With Derby . &quot;
- Mmm . - Yes , sir .
French museum bought it . snapped it right up .

Oh , she &apos;s just crazy about that painting .
well , I &apos;m glad I ran into you . I don &apos;t want to miss this last act . Yes .

terrific tonight , isn &apos;t it ?
rather .
Excusez-moi .
c &apos;est bien chez Monsieur Curtis ?
non . monsieur Curtis a déménagé .
il demeure cent quinze rue de la Faisanderie .
- Merci bien . - Il n &apos;y a pas de quoi , monsieur .
Pourrais-je parler à Monsieur Curtis ?
- You want to talk to Mr. Curtis , don &apos;t you ? - Yes . &#91; Chuckling &#93;
well , I &apos;m sorry , but Mr. Curtis is not at home .
Oh . what time do you expect him back ?
well , Mr. Curtis is out of town .
that &apos;s too bad .
- Something important ? - Rather .
well , I &apos;ll let you talk to his secretary .
to his , uh , secretary ?
Yes , to his secretary . please .
Hello .
- Mr. Curtis &apos;s secretary ? - The same .
my card .
&quot; Thomas B. Chambers , London &apos;s leading playwright ... and foremost wit . &quot;
Oh , come on . it doesn &apos;t say that .
it should .
- Hello , you old vampire , you ! - You hooligan !
- You Benedict Arnold ! - You -
shall we be seated ?
- Mmm ! like your suit . - Oh , thanks very much .
I &apos;m sorry George isn &apos;t here .
he &apos;s in Nice . he &apos;s painting a Mrs. Butterfield .
really ?
a rotund but noble creature from Des Moines .
- Mmm . des Moines , Iowa . - Yes .
Oh , it &apos;s so good to see you .
is it ?
- I &apos;ve so much to - - To tell me .
Yes .
I can imagine .
Oh , Tommy , if you &apos;ve forgiven George , why not me ?
- We did the same thing . - Not at all .
George betrayed me for you .
without wishing to flatter you , I understood that .
I can still understand it .
but you betrayed me for George .
an incredible choice .
Tommy .
you didn &apos;t keep it oiled .
I did for a while .
the keys are rusty ... and the shift is broken .
but it still rings .
it still rings .
does it ?
Oh ! Mr. Plunkett . please .
Gilda ?
- Hello , Gilda . - Hello .
I must get in touch with George immediately .
I just got back from London , dropped into the Luxembourg Museum with some friends ... and big results for George .
- I &apos;m glad . - A commission for two portraits .
Mrs. Olsen of Buffalo . you know the Buffalo Olsens .
- Oh , yes . - And Ernie Maxwell , the tomato juice man .
- The tomato juice man . - Hmm . both are willing to pay as high as -
why , what &apos;s the matter ? is George back ? why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
- He came unexpectedly this morning . - He did ?
- Mm-hmm . - George !
Shh ! he &apos;s asleep .
he only arrived a couple of hours ago . he had a dreadful night on the train .
you know , his old neuralgia &apos;s back .
Oh . well , you tell him to get in touch with me just as soon as he wakes up .
- Good-bye . - Good-bye . thanks , Max .
- Oh , I almost - - Shh !
I almost forgot to tell you . guess who I saw in London .
- The king ? - No , no , no ! Tom Chambers .
Oh . how is he ?
well , I wouldn &apos;t want George to hear this , but if you ask me , no good .
you made the right choice , all right - in a way .
that guy in there - 10 times as good .
Max , do me a favor . go away .
of course , I know , you always had a soft spot for this fellow Chambers .
please , Max . I &apos;ve a terrible headache .
why , what &apos;s the matter ? anything wrong ?
no . just one of my blue days .
- Can I do anything for you ? - No , Max , please !
well , uh , don &apos;t tell George that I even mentioned Tom .
I wouldn &apos;t want to be mixed up - You know how it is .
- It &apos;s a rather delicate matter . - And you don &apos;t want to broach it .
- No . - Then don &apos;t .
- Good-bye , Max . - Good-bye .
- Thanks . - Why don &apos;t you try some aspirin ?
Oh , you &apos;re sweet , Max , but aspirin won &apos;t help this time .
- Nothing serious , I hope . - I hope not .
well , if - if anything should happen -
I &apos;ll come to you and ask for your advice .
- Will you ? - Always , Max .
- Thank you , Gilda . - Thank you .
Good-bye .
breakfast is ready .
no orange juice ?
we never have any .
darling , will you remember after this - orange juice every morning , hmm ?
large glass .
every morning , huh ?
except Sunday .
uh , baked apple .
it &apos;s going to make a big revolution in my menu .
the eggs are just right .
you can have mine too .
- No eggs for Gilda ? - No .
- Conscience bothering you ? - No .
confused ?
very much so .
- Gilda . - Yes ?
is George still given to smashing things ?
well , we have to tell him the truth regardless of what happens to the furniture .
I wonder if he &apos;ll hit me .
he was never very civilized .
you &apos;re right . he is kind of - kind of barbaric .
you know , Gilda , we did a marvelous job on that third act ... and I have a feeling that if we got together and collaborated on a note to leave behind ... and really worked on it ... it would not only be a very fine piece of literature ... but it might save me a black eye .
no , no , I can &apos;t run away . I don &apos;t know how I &apos;m going to tell him .
I don &apos;t dare think .
I don &apos;t even know what I &apos;m going to tell him .
it &apos;s very simple .
you love me .
that &apos;s the only thing I &apos;m sure of right now .
let &apos;s forget the rest . let &apos;s not talk about it .
we &apos;ve two more days . let &apos;s enjoy them .
Oh , my dear !
Tommy , I never forgot you .
in fact , you never left me .
you haunted me like a nasty ghost .
on rainy nights , I could hear you moaning down the chimney .
Tommy . Tommy .
- What &apos;ll we do after lunch ? - We &apos;ll take a long walk for our digestion .
Oh , yes , let &apos;s walk and walk until we &apos;re dead tired .
Gilda , I &apos;ve got a better idea .
let &apos;s stay home instead .
well , London Louie , the old rat himself !
- You phony playwright ! how are you ? - I &apos;m fine .
- When did you arrive ? - La-Last night .
boy , I can &apos;t tell you how -
- How are you , darling ? - Fine .
I forgot to kiss you . you can blame him .
- Well , how are you , pal ? - Ouch !
fine .
lucky I walked out on the Butterfields .
well , what happened ?
Oh , a very involved argument about la Butterfield &apos;s double chin .
I said to her , &quot; Madam , I am an artist , not a masseur . &quot;
up speaks Mr. Butterfield , and , uh -
what are you doing in that suit ?
tuxedo for breakfast , huh ? is that a new London custom ?
- George - - I didn &apos;t ask you .
well , Tom .
you know what I &apos;m thinking .
it &apos;s true .
- George - - Shut up !
well , that &apos;s one way of meeting the situation .
shipping clerk comes home , finds missus with boarder .
he breaks dishes .
it &apos;s pure burlesque .
then there &apos;s another way .
intelligent artist returns unexpectedly , finds treacherous friends .
both discuss the pros and cons of the situation in grown-up dialogue .
high-class comedy , enjoyed by everybody .
and there &apos;s a third way .
I &apos;ll kick your teeth out , tear your head off and beat some decency into you !
cheap melodrama . very dull .
George , stop it .
still very dull .
I suppose you feel sorry for him .
I feel sorry for you .
I &apos;m sorry I hurt you .
but it was inevitable .
go on . get out of here , both of you .
it &apos;s hard to believe I - I loved you both .
- George ! - I don &apos;t want any part of either of you .
go with him in his top hat and fancy pants and silly name in lights ... and good luck to both of you !
the London train leaves at 4 : 00 .
you &apos;ll be very happy .
I promise .
thank you , Tom .
I &apos;ll pack .
Good-bye , George .
you did the right thing about the Butterfields .
and , George ... after I &apos;ve gone , don &apos;t change .
don &apos;t ever bow to double chins .
stay an artist .
that &apos;s important .
in fact , the most important thing .
I didn &apos;t want to praise you in front of Gilda , but you certainly pack a wicked right .
a real wallop .
there are a number of things here which belong to her .
Oh , that &apos;s all right . never mind .
no , no , I don &apos;t want them . where shall I send them ?
forward them in my name in care of the Carlton Theatre , London .
- And her mail ? - Same place . I &apos;ll see that she gets it .
- Anything else ? - Not that I can think of .
if anything should come up , will you be at this address ?
that &apos;s immaterial . I don &apos;t wish to enter into any correspondence .
as you wish .
better tell her to hurry up . it &apos;s getting to be a strain .
- Well , you gotta give her a chance to pack . - Well , tell her to hurry up !
all right ! all right ! hurry up , Gilda !
hurry up , darling .
here , you rattlesnake .
- So that &apos;s how you feel . - Yes , that &apos;s how I feel . understand ?
perfectly .
- I felt that way once . - &#91; Bell Dings &#93;
Gilda , have you got room in your trunk ?
here . for you .
- What &apos;s that ? - A note from Gilda .
&quot; Tommy dear .
I am running away because I am afraid your house in London has a chimney too ... and I fancy on rainy nights , I would hear -
and I fancy on rainy nights , I would hear that old devil George moaning .
so be nice , and let me be nice .
maybe I &apos;ll like it . Gilda . &quot;
- You think she &apos;ll come back ? - No .
should we try to find her ?
what &apos;s the use ?
the mother of the arts wants to be a nice girl .
tragic . &#91; hiccups &#93;
no , it &apos;s comic .
two slightly used artists in the ash can .
you &apos;ll get drunk .
it &apos;s the only sensible thing to do .
to Gilda .
would you care to hit me ? please help yourself .
sorry . I &apos;m too high-class .
- A gentleman , huh ? - To my fingertips .
may I refer you to a letter sent to you from London in a similar crisis ?
a very high-class document .
I could have enclosed some smallpox germs easily .
but you didn &apos;t .
very considerate .
let &apos;s drink to that .
to smallpox germs .
in Latin , variola cocci .
I think we &apos;re being very sensible .
extremely .
- Good for our livers . - Good for our immortal souls .
but bad for our stomachs .
Ah ! that &apos;s loose thinking .
what &apos;s bad for your stomach may be highly entertaining for my stomach .
I &apos;m glad the conversation has taken a scientific turn .
well , it &apos;s better than discussing this Gilda .
- We must forget Gilda . - Utterly .
- Let &apos;s change the subject . - Right .
let &apos;s talk about something entirely new .
let &apos;s talk about ourselves .
very interesting .
- To ourselves . - No .
it &apos;s bad taste .
well , we can &apos;t drink to nothing .
well , it &apos;s better than drinking to ourselves .
- To nothing . - No !
I refuse to be silly .
that &apos;s right .
well , there must be a reason for drinking .
- To , uh - - No !
I beg your pardon .
to Kaplan and McGuire .
uh , don &apos;t be hasty .
to Kaplan .
and now to McGuire .
a letter to my mother .
Mrs. Oscar F. Plunkett , Utica , New York .
dear Mama :
I will arrive on the 25th of this month on the U.S. Liner S.S. Manhattan .
I will be accompanied by Miss Gilda Farrell .
Miss Gilda Farrell is the daughter of Mr. And Mrs. Anthony G. Farrell ... of Fargo , North Dakota .
- Got the ring ? - Check .
- Feel nervous , Max ? - No .
had a fine nap . feel a hundred percent .
how does it feel to be Mrs. Plunkett ? any different ?
well , it feels like standing with your feet on the ground .
peaceful , Max , and so secure .
you bet .
it &apos;s going to be nice to be a law-abiding citizen .
Gilda !
what lovely flowers .
&quot; Strump and Egelbauer . &quot;
very fine people , Strump and Egelbauer .
- Biggest cement people in town . - Oh .
Oh , you &apos;ll like &apos; em .
they sound adorable .
- Gilda . - Yes , Max ?
now that it &apos;s all over - the excitement , et cetera -
I &apos;d like to know , what &apos;s your attitude ?
my attitude ? well , toward what ?
I mean , do you love me ?
Oh , Max .
people should never ask that question on their wedding night .
it &apos;s either too late or too early .
I &apos;m your wife , Max .
that &apos;s well put .
- Gilda , it &apos;s 9 : 30 . - Oh , that late ?
Yes , and I have an appointment in the morning , 10 : 15 sharp .
Oh , yes .
beautiful !
&quot; Kaplan and McGuire &quot; !
your friends from now on , as well as mine .
what did they do that for ?
why , they want to remember us . I think it &apos;s very nice of them .
this is no time for remembering .
it would have been much more tactful of them to forget . I think it &apos;s offensive .
Oh , well , now , that &apos;s a closed chapter in your life .
anyhow , you &apos;ve nothing to worry about on that score .
- I &apos;ve forgiven you . - Forgiven me ? for what ?
Oh , that &apos;s all right .
- Well , I don &apos;t want to be forgiven ! - Well , I forgive you just the same .
it &apos;ll make you feel better .
it &apos;s their idea of a joke .
I can just see them sitting in China , laughing their heads off .
about what ?
it &apos;s a rotten trick .
- It &apos;s cheap . - Well , it shouldn &apos;t surprise you .
they never fooled me for a minute . hooligans .
Max , I don &apos;t care to discuss them at all ... but if you ever feel it &apos;s necessary to mention them ... don &apos;t call them hooligans !
Oh , well , of course , they have some fine qualities .
please stop talking about them !
it &apos;s my wedding night .
leave those two boys where they are - in China !
I &apos;ve an appointment tomorrow morning .
10 : 15 sharp . it &apos;s important .
- Hello , darling . - Hello .
well , Gilda . great news for you .
- Our party &apos;s in the bag . - Really ?
- Yes , sir . guess what . - I give up .
- Mr. Egelbauer has accepted . - Is that good ?
say , listen , I &apos;ll guarantee you one thing -
let this party be a success , and inside of two weeks we &apos;ll be invited to the Egelbauers .
I see . an eye for an eye , a tooth for a tooth .
Oh , don &apos;t talk like that .
Strump and Egelbauer are figuring on the greatest publicity campaign in the history of cement .
well , what about the Strumps ? don &apos;t we have to invite them too ?
Mr. Strump comes first . &quot; Strump and Egelbauer . &quot;
no , no , no . we can &apos;t have them at the same time .
- They &apos;re not on speaking terms . - That &apos;s right .
I forgot about Mr. Strump and Mrs. Egelbauer .
Oh , don &apos;t mention that !
don &apos;t even breathe it .
- I won &apos;t . - You promise ?
promise .
word of honor ?
cross my heart .
and please don &apos;t worry about the Strumps .
a week from Tuesday we have the Strumps .
that &apos;s diplomacy .
and if this Strump party is a big social success ... is there any chance we &apos;ll be invited to the Strumps ?
- It &apos;s a cinch . - What a season !
everybody , please . everybody who wants to play Twenty Questions , all in the living room .
everybody who wants to play Twenty Questions , all in the living room .

everybody who wants to play -
Gilda , what are you doing here ?
- Just resting between rounds . - Oh .
well , we &apos;re going to play Twenty Questions in the living room .
- Mr. Egelbauer &apos;s requested it . - Oh , Max !
Oh , it &apos;s gonna be great fun .
but I &apos;ve had so much fun all evening . it &apos;s almost too much for me .
Post Office with Kaplan and McGuire .

but Mr. Egelbauer -

no , not exactly expected .
anticipated , uh , hoped for and dreamed about .
- Do you wish to see Mr. Plunkett ? - No !
- Positively no . - Mrs. Plunkett , if you please .
Mrs. Plunkett is engaged in playing Twenty Questions .
- She can &apos;t be disturbed . - Oh ! Oh , I see .
- Twenty Questions ? - Mmm .
- Hmm . - It makes it rather difficult .
well , uh , what you say , Inspector ?
I beg your pardon . this is Inspector Knox .

well , uh , Inspector ... how did the butler strike you ?
- A dual personality . - Hmm .
shall we , uh , look over the premises ?
Righto , Sergeant .
we may run into some valuable clues .
- Shall we start with the kitchen ? - No .
- Let &apos;s begin with the boudoir . - Ah .
- Animal , vegetable or mineral ? - Animal !
- Gilda ! - I won &apos;t do it !
I guessed Mr. Egelbauer in 10 questions , and that &apos;s enough . I &apos;m worn out .
Gilda , I insist .
I won &apos;t do it !
- You &apos;re ruining everything . - I don &apos;t care !
I won &apos;t ask Mr. Egelbauer to sing .
- All right . then I &apos;ll have to ask him myself . - Fine !
- And you &apos;ll have to come downstairs and listen . - Nothing doing .
but he-he - he brought his music .
I &apos;m not going to listen to that Egelbauer sing !
I won &apos;t ! I won &apos;t ! I won &apos;t !
Oh , please , Max , let me rest .
all right . get your rest .
take two minutes and come down .

Oh , I see . I see what you mean . hooligans !
that &apos;s what they are , and that &apos;s what they always will be !

maybe I want to be a hooligan .
no . no , Gilda , no . no , you don &apos;t .
- Uh , you want a glass of water ? - No , thank you .
now , I &apos;m willing to drop the whole matter . I forgive you .
are you starting to forgive me again ?
now , just relax and be a good girl . I &apos;ll handle this .
you let me go down first , and I &apos;ll sell them the idea that - that you &apos;ve had an attack of hiccups .
and then two minutes later you come down , and you tell Mr. Egelbauer -
- I &apos;ll tell him ! - Yes . you tell Mr. Egelbauer that you &apos;re extremely sorry .
make a simple little apology , but sincere .
say that you heard his singing all the way upstairs ... and even at that distance it was wonderful .
now , listen , Plunkett , Incorporated !
you go down to those customers of yours and give them a sales talk .
sell them anything you want , but not me .
I &apos;m fed up with underwear , cement , linoleum !
I &apos;m sick of being a trademark married to a slogan !
- Gilda ! - Don &apos;t you tell &apos; em I &apos;ve got hiccups .
tell &apos; em I &apos;ve got the advertising blues , the billboard collywobbles !
slogans and sales talks morning , noon and night ... and not one human sound out of you and your whole flock of Egelbauers !
that &apos;s just a lot of words . there &apos;s only one issue here .
if this Strump and Egelbauer deal is spoiled , I &apos;ll know just who to blame .
- Where - Where is everybody ? - I think they &apos;ve all gone home .
gone home ? what for ? why ?
- You should never have socked McGuire . - Socked McGuire ?
I admit I was a bit careless , but how should I know Kaplan would creep up in the back ?
that &apos;s partnership .
- Kaplan ? creep up in the back ? - Yes .
but the real surprise of the evening was Egelbauer .
- He starts slow - - But warms up . wonderful footwork .
Wh-What - What - What happened ?
- Was there a fight ? - A marvelous fight !
it was quite a demonstration .
Oh !
- Gilda ! - I know all about it .
I &apos;m awfully sorry , Max , but it all can be remedied very easily .
but we &apos;ve got to do something about it at once .
quite right . but let me do it . after all , it &apos;s my friends who caused the trouble , and I &apos;m to blame .
- Well , what do you - - Max , I &apos;m going to make a great sacrifice for your business .
I &apos;m going to leave you .
leave me ? you &apos;re crazy . that won &apos;t help .
Oh , yes , it will , tremendously .
now , tomorrow you put on your nicest derby and you go and call on your customers ... and tell &apos; em you &apos;ve separated from your wife ... because of her connection with those two terrible wretches .
I guarantee you , you &apos;ll be considered the biggest martyr in the history of cement .
so , I see .
that &apos;s the way you feel about the matter .
good old Max . cheer up .
you really haven &apos;t any complaints .
I &apos;ve more than doubled your business since our bridal night ... and after I leave you , it &apos;s liable to triple .
that &apos;s all you really wanted anyway .
- Now , Gilda , be sensible . - &#91; Phone Rings &#93;
Oh . that &apos;s Mr. Egelbauer .
Hello .
Oh , hello , Mr. Egelbauer .
Oh , how are you , Mr. Egelbauer ?
so ! and poor Mrs. Egelbauer - How is she ?
tsk , tsk , tsk , tsk , tsk .
well , Mr. Egelbauer , you must realize that I had nothing to do with it whatsoever .
Good-bye , Max .
Gilda , just a minute ! y-yes , Mr. Egelbauer ?
Oh , I can explain everything to your fullest satisfaction .
- &#91; Door Closes &#93; - I guarantee it .
Oh , thank you , Mr. Egelbauer . Oh , that &apos;s big of you .
tomorrow morning , 9 : 00 sharp .
Oh , you &apos;ve made me a very happy man , Mr. Egelbauer ! &#91; Chuckles &#93;
now we &apos;ll have some fun . back to Paris .
- To the same old studio ? - The same old dump .
- And work ! - Great .
- But you can &apos;t paint in that suit . - I &apos;ll burn it .
- And you can &apos;t write in that top hat . - In the ash can with it !
let &apos;s hear , Gilda . can you still say &quot; rotten &quot; ?
- Rotten ! - &#91; Tom Laughing &#93;
Gilda , you gonna criticize us with that baseball bat of yours ?
till you say &quot; uncle . &quot;
Ha-ha ! Gilda !
dear critic !
but , boys , this is very important . there &apos;s one thing that has to be understood .
- I know . - Yes , we know .
it &apos;s a gentleman &apos;s agreement .

that ricks haw &apos;s passed us !
H ey boy !
you cal this the &quot; power of scence &apos; ? what a joke ! shame on you !
if you &apos;re a man , prove it ! go faster ,
use the whip ! ,
come on , you foo !
why don &apos;t you ask the horse ?
I &apos;m not the one puling this .
quite a character , this young driver .
young sir , just a itte faster ,
why not please the customers a itte .
but Shiraito didn &apos;t even get a response from him .
Shiraito thought that he was waiting for a tip . so she offers . ,
how about 50 sen ,
let her out a itte ,
keep it !
horses don &apos;t move for cash , so there &apos;s no use ! .
little upstart !
who do you think you are ,
Outrun by a rickshaw !
the power of modern civilization ? .
you want me to pass that ,
out of spite and to take his revenge , he starts running the horse for all it was worth !
Hey , hey there ! . boy !
no tripping or slipping , right ,
I don &apos;t know .
guess it &apos;s straight on till the horse fals ,
slow it down a little , you fool !
quite a stubborn lad , this driver ,
the horse at full speed now . passed the rickshaw in no time at all .
but one of the carriage &apos; s axles gave out .
Shiraito figured he deserved it ,
now our young driver doesn &apos; t look quite so proud ,
W el ,
W e &apos;l make it to I s urugi by evenng ,
popped an axe ,
Overdid it a bit .
what &apos;ll I do about this .
no good ? .
that &apos;s too bad ,
guess this &apos;l take more than a tip ,
&quot; flower of science &quot; .
I &apos;d heard it was fast , but never imagined this ,
by evening , rght ,
get down from there , sister .
what ? ,
come now , miss !
what are you doing ? ,
getting you to lsurugi by nightfal .
now !
after dragging her down , he pulled her up behind him on the horse .
there he goes , .. ! what about us ? ,
when they arrived at Isurugi , Shiraito was unconscious ,
when Shiraito regained consciousness , he set off back to Takaoka .
he wasn &apos; t like any other men she knew .
he left a great impression on her , who till now lived for her art ,
what &apos;s his name ? ,
everyone calls him Kin-san .
I see .
Kin-san ,
he left behind a book .
a difficult law book . not typical reading for a carriage driver .
this was the reason for Shiraito &apos; s little smile .
three days had passed .
she wants to see him again .
Shiraito , your cue ! , You a right ? ,
Y es , yes .
I &apos; m coming .
ladies and Gentlemen !
I bring you the pride of our show ! ,
the one and only Taki no Shirato !
we &apos;ve been waiting for you !
a Goddess !
Tak no Shiraito !
a vixen playing battledore and shuttlecock !
breathtaking !
a cascading goddess ! .
like the Goddess of Crystal Palace ,
she mesmerized the audience .
the curtain falls in the midst of this excitement .
the annual Asano River summer show .
monkey acts , a girl acrobatic troupe , stunt performers , knife throwers , living dolls , view boxes and electric magic .
even among such a variety of spectacles , Shiraito was quite a crowd pleaser .
still the day passes and night spreads her veil .
almost like in a dream , the cheering crowds leave .
the night then brings the performers their first free time of the day .
the glimmering moon in the sky shines on the white peony that is Shiraito .
what a lovely night !
t oo good for seeping ,
the only sound carried in the breeze was the water &apos;s meandering .
I &apos; m al worn out , So tired !
dressed lke a young girl when I &apos;m already 24 !
but still , what a night !
Shiraito let the breeze carry her away ,
her gaze moved up along Utatsubashi Bridge .
a young man sleeping peacefully under the moon .
who &apos;s that ? .
Shinzo the barker ? ,
what do you know ? , It &apos;s cool up here wth some breeze ,
Shnzo , you &apos;ll catch a cold ,
go ahead , catch a cod ,
see if I care ,
she was convinced it was Shinzo .
but when the moon lit up the man &apos;s face
she saw , .. !
the pale face of the carriage driver she could not forget .
Oh my , . it &apos;s Kin-san !
Shiraito wondered if she was dreaming ,
how many times had she thought of him ?
had the keeper of destiny heard her prayers ?
here they were , alone on this bridge at night .
her cheeks blushing , Shiraito stared at his sleeping face there in the moonlight ,
Ki n-san ,
you sleep like a baby ,
sweet Kin-san ! ,
Kin-san !
Ouch ! that hurts !
you &apos;ll catch a cold sleeping out here .
Oh , did you put this cover over me ? .
I &apos;ve been thinking about you , How &apos;ve you been ? ,
huh ? . who are you ?
I &apos;ve never seen you before ,
it &apos;s me , You remember ? .
how very kind of you ,
I remember .
Kin-san ,
don &apos;t try and tel me that you don &apos;t remember me ! ,
wait ! wait a second .
I , and you ,
I don &apos;t ...
on the way to lsurugi , raced a rckshaw on a carriage ,
remember ? .
you pulled me down and threw me on a horse ,
don &apos;t you remember that woman ? ,
that was you ? .
you mean I really had to tel you ? ,
stop being coy ,
I &apos;m not trying to be , but with 20 or 30 customers a day , am I supposed to remember al of their faces ?
Oh .
but do you drag women away on horseback every day ?
of course not , I couldn &apos;t do that every day !
Kn-san ! Hey Kin-san !
he surely isn &apos;t happy .
what brings you here to Kanazawa ? ,
what brings you here to Kanazawa ? ,
I lost that job because of you ,
because of me ? ,
you must be joking !
sure , because of me !
so you &apos;re angry at me ? .
Hey ,
lend me your pipe , wil you ? ,
okay ? ,
pushy , aren &apos;t you !
what &apos;s wrong wth this pipe ? .
you can &apos;t even taste the tobacco .
look at that , you lazy bum ,
you &apos;re snge , right ? ,
but with such good looks , you must have many women ,
rdiculous !
you mean , . then .. , There &apos;s no one ?
of course not !
Oh ! realy ? .
can &apos;t you quiet down ? ,
a bug !
help me !
take it out !
where ? ,
down my back .
just a eaf ,
Kin-san , Kin-san !
so , what dd you say about losing your job for me ? ,
tel me more about it ,
that time , it was fine that I overtook the rickshaw .
but after the broken axle , the company let me go the next day .
I see . then I guess , .
it realy was my fault , I see .
so now , what will you do ?
what wil I do ? . I have to eat ,
I &apos;ve got to fnd some work somewhere ,
there are a lot of high officials in Kanazawa . I figured that I could find work on a carriage ,
I see , Dd you find anything ?
right , you kidding ? .
that &apos;s why I &apos;m sleeping out here ,
maybe I &apos;m out of line to say this , but you &apos;re no carriage boy ,
no , I wasn &apos;t born a carriage driver ,
my ancestors were samurai ,
father died three years ago , I had to quit school ,
then two years ago , my mother passed away ,
left all alone , I had to work , I started out in that carriage company ,
and here I am . such a disgrace ,
but I &apos;m not finished ! I won &apos;t go to the grave a carriage driver .
I &apos;ve got plans , Plans and hopes ,
but stil , I guess it all comes down to chance ,
that &apos;s rght , Chance .
she rules us all ,
chance and fate , That &apos;s all there is ,
Kin-san ,
you can &apos;t just gve up , What knd of plans ? ,
is t going back to school ? .
Yeah , I &apos;d lke to get a law degree ,
Wel , if t &apos;s schooing you want , you ought to go to Tokyo ,
Tokyo ? .
I &apos;d be there f I could ,
but that &apos;s where chance comes in ,
it &apos;s not that easy ,
come on !
you go ,
you &apos;ve got to go to Tokyo !
listen ,
don &apos;t get angry with me ,
what f l ,
I helped you out ? . I mean , with money ?
if only just your tuition .
but why ? . there &apos;s nothng n it for you ,
that &apos;s , .
for me ? ,
that kind of talk is for strangers ,
if you open your heart to mine , then wouldn &apos;t
that be &quot; in t &apos; for me ? .
please !
let me help you !
bowed to the keeper of destiny , Shiraito said a secret prayer .
then she led him back to her tent .
don &apos;t be so quiet , Loosen up .
let me help you wth your schooling ,
please ? , I &apos;l show you .
one day you &apos;l be a great , famous man and make me proud ,
until then , I &apos;l help you no matter what it takes ,
Kin-san ,
you &apos;ve got to study hard and become a great man !
Miss ,
such a noble offer ,
I &apos;m indebted to you , I wil do my best ,
my name is Kinya Murakoshi ,
don &apos;t get all serious now . Lighten up a itte ,
my name is Tomo Mizushima , 24 years old ,
you ? ,
Oh I &apos;m .. , 25 years old .
I see . then you &apos;re a year oder than me ,
here , take this money , 30 yen .
the sooner you leave for Tokyo the better , aright ? .
Kinya Murakoshi never forgets a promise !
some day , no matter what happens to me ,
I wil never forget you ,
whatever it takes , I will repay you ! I promise !
repay me ? ,
Al I want is for your dreams to come true .
no , that &apos;s not fair , Can &apos;t accept that !
that &apos;s my obligation to you for beieving in me ,
what do you want for yourself ? ,
please , tel me ! ,
you sure ? ,
then , .. let me tell you ,
Wel l ,
look at me blushing like a shy innocent girl ,
an od maid ike me !
what I want is , My wish is , ..
I , .I want , I want you to want me !
blushing red , Shiraito finally got out those words .
Shiraito promises to see him through his schooling .
Shiraito and Kinya grabbed chance by the horns and joined their fate in love .
the sun starts showing its face ,
near Utatsubashi Bridge ,
the sun shines on the little tent pitched on the bank of Asano River .
there in the morning mist Kinya spots a signboard ,
he discovers that Tomo Mizushima of the night before was the famous water artist Taki no Shiraito .
no ! no , look away !
I g nore what the sign says , T aki no Shiraito ? ,
here with you , I &apos;m just an ordinary girl .
I am Tomo Mizushima ,
the two held each other tightly as they headed for Kanazawa Station ,
their souls were as one as they made promises of a great future .
Kinya eager to acquire his law degree , he left for Tokyo .
as if in a dream , two years passed since .
Kinya opened his heart to Shiraito and left for Tokyo ,
how fast the time went by ,
Shiraito continued to send Kinya money ,
Kinya studied hard to finish school to begin his career and make her proud .
he was a serious student and planned each step he took in meticulous detail .
fortunately he could rent one of the rooms for the servants at a high official &apos;s residence .
there also was a generous old woman who took him on as her own flesh and blood .
the master arriving home from his office ,
W elcome home .
himself an ex-carriage driver , and the master driven to his office every morning ,
Kinya told himself that one day it would be him in that carriage ,
m r , M urakos hi .
look at hi m ,
one day , you too wil be a wise and important person ,
here &apos;s another etter with money from your sister ,
thank you ,
it was the usual letter from Shiraito with some money .
&quot; l am encosng a little money with this letter ,
please accept it with my prayers for your success ,
my thoughts are only of you as I continue on the tour . &quot;
even with her great appeal , the life of a traveling entertainer is never easy .
there are good times . there are bad times .
but her love for Kinya had made her strong , giving her the strength to withstand any hardship .
an esteemed water artist ,
Shiraito known for her beauty and impulsiveness ,
Ionged for Kinya far away in Tokyo ,
one day I &apos;ll become his wife , &quot; &apos;
such thought sustained her as she continued on .
still , the approaching autumn leads the way for the coming winter ,
as white patches can be seen up on the mountain peaks , the gem of the summer , Shiraito &apos; s water act , loses its sparkle ,
the crowds come no more .
this is a tough time for the performers ,
in such times , they had no choice but to .. , turn to a man like Gozo Iwabuchi , a loan shark .
H and it over ,
my wife has it .
all we &apos;ve got ,
this barely covers the interest , T o say nothing of the principal ,
old rag !
do something ! now !
I &apos;m broke !
wait until our next show at Naoetsu ,
I &apos;l make enough there ,
so pease ,
Naoetsu ?
. I don &apos;t know , You &apos;re touring with the water trcks , The summer &apos;s over ,
a long winter for you , Problems , problems ,
don &apos;t jnx me ! I need al the luck I can get ,
Shiraito !
let me have a cherry too ,
hands off !
these are my favorte , So hands off .
instead , why not ask your honey Shinzo to buy you some noodles ? ,
Dea , Nadeshiko ? .
not even one ? .
they all knew about Nadeshiko , the Knife Throwing Troupe &apos;s star , and Shinzo the barker .
buy your gir some noodles !
today the monkey trainer was calling it quits .
Chomatsu , where are you headed ? ,
I &apos;l spend the winter at Dashoji Tempe ,
I see .
Wel , good luck ,
thank you so much ,
you take care too ,
the summer &apos;s over , so there &apos;s nothing eft , but to wait until the snow melts in the sprng ,
with your popularity , you &apos;ll be fine , No probem ,
finally winter came calling with a coating of white .
unable to put up a show , they sit around like brooding hens .
but Shiraito never forgets about her love .
she scrapes some money together and writes him for the first time in weeks .
&quot; Winter has come and the audiences have gone .
the waiting season for performers , I hope for the spring to come ,
I am very sorry ,
I am enclosing this time haf the usual amount .
this is the best I can do now .
for now please accept what I can give and study hard ,
in the spring , I &apos;l make up the difference as soon as I can .
I have only the highest hopes for you , &quot; &apos;
finally she signed it &quot; Tomo Murakoshi , &quot; &apos;
Tomo Murakoshi &quot; &quot; She liked the sound of those two words .
what &apos;s this ! , Ogin !
Shiraito !
Hey ! don &apos;t act like an idiot !
I thought that we were al friends here ! .
what &apos;s the idea , Ogin ? ,
forgive me , Shiraito ! . forgive me ,
please forgive me , Shiraito !
I thought that even if told you why I need that money , you &apos;d say no , so , I , ..
I , . I &apos;m sorry ,
so sorry ,
of course I &apos;d say no ,
you know how long t took me to put this together ? ,
do you think I &apos;d et you drink it away ? .
eh , Ogin !
drink it away ? . think I &apos;d steal money for sake ?
do I look like such a hdeous woman ? .
you broke my heart !
my mother , My mother is dying !
what , what shal I do ? ,
my mother in T okyo . she &apos;s dying and I want to see her !
I don &apos;t know what to do !
I have to go to her !
help me , Shiraito ! . I can &apos;t stay here !
unable to see my dying mother , and tortured every day by Mnami , my lousy husband !
do me a favor and kil me !
I &apos;d rather be dead !
kil me , please , Shirato !
shut up ! what &apos;s all this gibberish ? .
go ahead and cry ! . it &apos;ll do you no good here !
get out of my sight !
I mean now !
go cry your wicked heart out ,
this money is for Kin-san . &apos;
like I might really give it away ! for what ? &quot; she thinks .
but the thought of Ogin not seeing her dying mother touched Shiraito .
without realizing , without knowing ,
Shiraito tossed the money at Ogin , She was just that kind of woman ,
t ake it ,
Shiraito , this money ! realy ? .
Shiraito , I &apos;m so sorry !
I &apos;l never forget this !
as ong as I breathe , I &apos;l remember my debt to you !
thank you , Shiraito ! . I &apos;m sorry ,
that money means a lot to my Kin-san , but it &apos;s for your mother &apos;s sake !
take it and get out of my sight !
out of here ! rght this instant !
can I really take this ? ,
still , for all her tears , Ogin ran off with a young stagehand that same night .
we must expect the unexpected in life ,
Winter drags on ,
run out on by his wife , Minami the Knife Thrower is not in a good mood .
while everyone grumbled about the season , the only laughter came from young Nadeshiko and Shinzo .
the two always sparkled with their young love ,
how happy they look . &apos;
&quot; &apos; soon Kin-san will come back for me , &quot;
Shi nzo , you two aren &apos;t alone ,
Oh , I &apos; m rea sorry ,
&quot; &apos; the renowned beauty I was , loved by all for my art as well ,
he made me a woman , accentuating my charms and completed me , &quot;
memories of Utatsubashi Bridge warmed Shiraito .
just a little longer , &quot;
my hair flowing in the air as we rode in the carriage .
you held me tightly as the horse went ,
but you are now so far away , as I continue on my tour , &quot; &apos;
she &apos;s a looker ,
no chance with her .
lost in thoughts of her lover n T okyo ,
there &apos;s nothng doing wth her , Not a chance ,
come on , Money works wonders ,
Nah ,
not with her ,
but , ook over there .
the young one there . what about her ? .
Nadeshiko , How about it ?
Nadeshiko , eh ? ,
she &apos;s pretty , No problem ? ,
no problem . she &apos;s in my troupe ,
it &apos;s a deal .
the weather cleared and the show was on ,
Minami the Knife Thrower did his thing on stage .
the audience was small .
but Iwabuchi forgot about Minami &apos;s debts as he fixed his eyes on young Nadeshiko , who was to become his tonight ,
even after a long closing , only this small turnout ,
every year this location brought problems .
farewell biddings and hopes for the year to come . &quot; &quot;
Looki ng bad , rea bad . we &apos;re out of luck here ,
look at those empty seats . this locaton &apos;s fnished .
I &apos;m off for Kashiwazak to see if we can get a show on there .
ths is al the money we &apos;ve got left , alrght ? ,
Shiraito , remember this s our life blood for now ,
take good care of t , Shiraito .
I &apos;m counting on you .
bring back some good news ,
I &apos;ll see what I can get going there ,
take care of the troupe while I &apos;m gone ,
stay out of trouble ,
Wel , see you .
I &apos;ll be back in no time !
take care ! .
Shiraito , it &apos;s your cue ,
I &apos;m coming .
Minami the Knife Thrower finished and Shiraito was on .
Shinzo was waiting for this moment to come up to call his Nadeshiko .
is it true ?
you realy going to lwabuchi &apos;s tonight ? .
is it true , Nadeshiko ? .
Iwabuchi already paid Minami , He &apos;s my boss .
he &apos;s seling me off ,
what am I to do ? ,
that &apos;s rdiculous !
what kind of a beast is he ? .
I don &apos;t want to go , But what can I do ? ,
but we need the money ,
I just want to wash my hands of this filthy business ,
what am I to do ? ,
same here , I don &apos;t want you to go !
for money ?
what a bastard !
if only I had some money ! ,
if I did , I &apos;d take you away from all these scum !
what am I to do ? ,
I want money !
there she is , I knew it !
Gotcha this time ! caught you red-handed !
not getting away this time !
meeting behnd my back ! , You brazen foo !
you &apos;re coming with me to see your boss .
come !
let him go !
Shinzo didn &apos;t do anything , Please !
you shut up !
wait ! ,
shut up and come with me !
sir , keep an eye on her , She &apos;s a shifty lass ,
please let me go ! don &apos;t take Shinzo !
quiet down , We &apos;re going to have fun tonght ,
no ! get away from me !
let go !
what are you gonna do !
he &apos;s been chasing my lttle gem . keep hands off her or I &apos;l show him !
this fool &apos;s one of yours , ain &apos;t he ? ,
they &apos;re young . what can you do ?
.
that night was filled with shouts and threats .
in the end Nadeshiko didn &apos;t go to Iwabuchi &apos;s house ,
but the two young lovers knew that they had to get away .
although wrong to run out on Shiraito who had looked after them , they made up their mind to elope .
n adeshiko !
leave now , we can make the first train ,
t ake ony what you need ,
rght or wrong , we &apos;re going . hurry !
not so fast !
Shiraito !
don &apos;t be fools . you &apos;d be caught at the staton ,
come around back ,
there &apos;s a boat waiting ,
Shiraito , can you forgve us ? ,
do I have a choice ? ,
Nadeshiko , here . take this money ,
you &apos;ll need it ,
money ? ,
Shiraito , we can &apos;t take money from you !
after all that you &apos;ve done for us !
the troupe will , ..
you &apos;l need money until you find work somewhere ,
just lsten to me , Take it .
this is the beginnng of an honest lfe for you two ,
I can &apos;t just let you go with nothing in your pockets .
make me happy ,
Shiraito ! we wil never forget you !
but promise me you &apos;ll stay together ,
be happy together forever no matter what , alright ? .
as Shiraito helped the two young lovers get away , she hoped her good deed would return as her happiness with Kinya .
what have you done now ?
where &apos;s my N adeshiko ? ,
what have you done wth her ? . it &apos;s all your medding !
what about me ? , What am I gonna do ? ,
not my business ,
have you got any proof ? .
no cue what you &apos;re talking about ,
proof ? , What about your Shinzo ? .
the two ran off together !
my wife eopes and now Nadeshiko ,
what am I gonna do without her ? ,
can &apos;t put on a show !
this is al your fault ! you gotta hep me !
without Nadeshiko , Iwabuchi won &apos;t end me anythng for my next tour .
you &apos;ve got to hep me out of this one ! Shiraito !
what a crybaby .
go ahead , Take it al ,
money ! that &apos;s what I need !
take that , get out of my sight and forget it .
we &apos;re through , That &apos;s all I got ,
come on , just get over it ,
money &apos;s al I need !
can &apos;t live without it , 1 0 , 20 , 30 ,
38 yen and 60 sen , That &apos;s it ? .
it doesn &apos;t quite make up for Nadeshiko ,
but it &apos;ll do . I &apos;ll take it ,
what &apos;s this ? ,
you talk big , don &apos;t you ? .
have you got anything ese to say ? .
I &apos;ve gotlots to say !
one day you &apos;re gonna pay for your medding !
you wait and see !
I &apos;l show you your place ! ,
I hope they &apos;re aright .
I feel good ,
I did something good .
I wonder how far they &apos;ve gotten by now ? ,
Gonji &apos;s back from his negotiations at Kashiwazaki .
he can &apos;t believe that Shiraito used up the money .
really ? . all of it ?
are you crazy ? ,
what got into you ? . how coud you do that ?
realy none eft ? , At all ? ,
come on , congratulate me ,
I did a good thng , I helped someone .
Kashiwazaki is no good , There &apos;s nothng going there ,
another low point .
no good ? .
realy ? , You &apos;re not kidding , Gonji ? .
another letter from Tokyo ,
Shiraito , this is no tme to be sending money to Tokyo ,
we don &apos;t even have any money for the troupe members !
think about that !
Shiraito hadn &apos;t sent anything in a while ,
it &apos;s almost time for his graduation , but she had no money left to see him through .
let &apos;s go to Kanazawa !
it &apos;ll be just the same in Kanazawa as here .
but we &apos;re from Kanazawa ,
something &apos;ll come up , We have the regulars , Let &apos;s go !
this winter &apos;s no good ,
Shiraito writes Kinya a letter .
&quot; &apos; with no prospects for a show in Sado Island , we &apos;re heading back to Kanazawa where I &apos;m sure something wil turn up ,
as soon as I get something going , I &apos;l send you the money that I promised ,
Unti then , please be patient , &quot;
realizing that she was having trouble sending him his allowance ,
Kinya sent Shiraito a response to the effect that he would get by from then on by himself .
&quot; l n arrears n tuition payments , I &apos; ve decided to work ,
even if I have to quit school for the time being to support myself ,
I swear to you that I wll fulfil my promse to you ,
don &apos;t burden yourself with worries for me . I &apos;ll get by , &apos;
what am I to do ? ,
I &apos;ve got to send him money ,
Shiraito , this is no joke !
money to send to Tokyo ? . what about our salaries !
Shiraito !
&quot; &quot; I can &apos;t send him the money he needs .
Shiraito resigned herself to the hopelessness of it .
Shiraito ,
what ? ,
come here ,
what ? ,
t ake a look ,
in the fourth ...
no , seventh aisle from the front ,
that man , He &apos;s a rich merchant ,
extremely loaded ,
what ? ,
what are you gettng at ? .
no , no , You &apos;ve got it wrong ,
if Taki no Shirato is asking , he &apos;s saying he &apos;l lend money wth no strngs attached .
come on , it &apos;s worth a try , Alright , Shraito ? .
it is so nice of you to come today .
I &apos;ve aways watched you perform on stage ,
but now sittng here with you !
what a beauty you are ! a Goddess !
have some tea ,
in need of financial assistance ? , You &apos;ve come to the right man ,
anything for Taki no Shiraito , For you , the sky &apos;s the imt ,
so gorgeous ! it &apos;s lke seeng an angel !
a sight to behold ! ,
just a second , Not qute ,
coud you hod it like this ? ,
we &apos;re tradtionalsts in this house ,
so , how much do you need ? .
30 yen ? , 50 yen ? , Or 1 00 yen ?
name your price .
get away from me !
don &apos;t play innocent ,
I came here to borrow money ! I &apos;ve got nothing to sel ,
come off it ,
you know the score , Come on ,
who do you think I am ? ,
forget it !
Shiraito !
wait now .
Shiraito ! wait ! ,
Ouch ! that hurts !
calm down ! take it easy !
Tak no Shiraito sels her art , not her body !
Taki no Shiraito sells her art , not her body !
she left on a memorable note , but found no means of getting money ,
at the end of her road , she came back to Kanazawa .
she went to Iwabuchi the loan shark , interested not in her art ,
but 300 yen buys a lot more than a water act .
Iwabuchi the loan shark tossed 300 yen at her as if it were nothing ,
and fixed his evil eyes on her like a viper .
he was as evil as his glare , Many women have fallen prey to him .
poor Shiraito was dragged into a real-life nightmare .
on the way back , right around Kenroku Park .
what &apos;re you , ! ,
gve me the money !
money ? , I don &apos;t have any !
you &apos;ve got 300 yen in your breast pocket !
what !
hand it over ! now !
let go ! rotten bastards ! ,
let go !
but Shiraito had no chance against six men .
knives glistened in the moonlight as they thrust them at Shiraito !
gve me the money !
get away from me ! rotten vilains !
that &apos;s mine ! , Give t back !
I need it ! give t back !
give t back !
shut up !

shut up !
she lay there in the night mist ,
when she woke up , she knew her 300 yen was gone .
instead there was a knife .
that money ,
that money was for Kn-san !
those bastards !
how dare them !
it was one of the knives that Minami used on stage !
Iwabuchi ! Ganged up with Minami ! he set me up !
bastard lwabuchi !
her whole body shook with anger .
with the knife in hand , she didn &apos;t have to think about where to go .
Iwabuchi ! where are you ! Iwabuchi !
Iwabuchi !
you &apos;re back ,
J ust as planned .
gve me my money !
you and Mnami ! you scum !

a knfe ? , Threatening me ?
I had t al panned out for you to come back here !

let &apos;s see what you &apos;re like a second tme around .
my Shiraito ,
let go of me !
let me go ! get away from me !
bastard !
come over here !
let go ! let go of me !
Iwabuchi had met his destiny in Shiraito &apos;s hands as the knife sunk deep into his belly .
I &apos;e ... killed him .
I killed him .
I &apos;m a murderer .
Shiraito was dazed .
she was in a panic ,
she grabbed the money stacked on the table .
Shiraito still in a state of panic , ran away from Iwabuchi &apos;s house .
she &apos; s a murderer !
they &apos;ll execute her !
before they get me ,
I j ust want to see Kin-san one more time ,
desperate to see her lover one last time , Shiraito ran straight to Kanazawa Station .
she caught the night train and headed for Tokyo where her love is ,
it wasn &apos; t long before the police discovered the murder ,
W e arrested Minami .
Hs knife was at the crme scene ,
stil , it is not an open and shut case ,
three years had passed since that night under the bridge .
with only an address to go on ,
Shiraito finally makes her way to Tokyo .
she searches for Kinya Murakoshi &apos;s place .
where does Ki nya Murakoshi live ? .
Kinya Murakoshi ? ,
Mr , Murakoshi lives in a room by the gate over there ,
you &apos;ll find an old ady who runs things .
excuse me , Is there anybody home ? ,
who is it ? ,
does Kinya Murakoshi live here ? .
Oh ? ,
is he home ?
please come inside ,
are you a friend of Mr , Murakosh ? .
come n , It &apos;s so cod outside ,
pease , come on in now .
is Mr. Murakoshi home ? .
I &apos;m sorry , he went somewhere with his boss ,
he didn &apos;t say where they were headed ,
not here ? , Unti ? ,
he didn &apos;t say , I really don &apos;t know ,
Mr , Murakosh , He &apos;s really not here ?
Oh .. , Your kimono is soiled ,
pease , don &apos;t mind that ,
fleeing from Kanazawa and finally finding his room , but Kinya &apos;s not there .
not here ? , Kin-san &apos;s ,
Shiraito was speechless .
she just blankly stared at the room ,
Kin-san &apos;s , not here ,
please , make yourself comfortabe here ,
you must have come a long way .
when he gets back , please give him ths ,
please keep this money safe for him ,
you sure ? . I &apos;l hold on to it for him .
it &apos;s realy too bad that he &apos;s not here now ,
she wanted to give him money no matter what ,
see her love one last time before she got caught .
but her wish was not met ,
but in this room ...
Shiraito could feel him here .
is this ... This is where Kin-san studies , .
so this is it ? . this is Mr , Murakoshi &apos;s room ?
Y es , He &apos;s such a serious man , Mr , Murakoshi ,
every night he stands at the door watching the master return and says softly to himself , &quot; One day that &apos;l be me , &quot;
it seems that he &apos;s got a terrific oder sister somewhere n the countryside ,
an oder sister ? .
Y es , he never stops talking about her .
whenever he taks about her , he studies even harder .
he goes on and on about how he &apos;s got to work hard to make her proud of him , to make up for her hep ,
he talks on and on about her , All the time ,
realy ? .
he does ? .
he &apos;s already started working , Become a wise man .
his sister must be very proud of such a brother ,
you &apos;re absolutely right !
she &apos;s a specia woman with a wonderfu heart !
I always tell him so , It &apos;s al thanks to her , If t weren &apos;t for her , he never would have made it ,
I hope that you can stay a little while and wait ,
I &apos;l bring us some tea ,
three years had passed .
Shiraito had been afraid , sure that he had forgotten her ,
but no , every day here in this room , he sat thinking of her as he studied .
but maybe it would be better if she didn &apos; t see him .
she was no longer the same Tomo Mizushima he knew .
she had killed a man , A murderer ,
Shiraito knew that it was better if they didn &apos; t meet .
but Shiraito was overcome by a blinding wave of intense joy .
Kinya thought of her as he studied hard .
he had taken up a post .
there she saw Kinya &apos; s certificate of appointment .
but her fleeting dream was stolen away by a detective who had followed from Kanazawa .
Shiraito had escaped as far as Tokyo , but was finally arrested .
a falling star blown away by the wind ,
on the train back to Kanazawa ,
I have nothing to live for , &quot;
better to just end it , &quot; &apos;
she made up her mind and threw herself to her death ,
stop the trai n !
suicide !
a woman ! ,
suicide !
by pure chance and luck , the small nearby restaurant she fled to was run by none other than young Shinzo and Nadeshiko .
she realy hasn &apos;t come ? .
t el the truth ! , There &apos;s no point hiding her ,
search the place !
Shiraito wasn &apos;t their only visitor .
no one else she knows around here ,
you &apos;re al she &apos;s got .
don &apos;t try to play the hero .
tel the poice if she shows up !
got that ? . understood ?
be sure to report ! ,
Shinzo closed up shop early today .
but of course Shiraito was hiding inside their place .
Shiraito !
Shiraito !
pul yoursef together ! , Look at you , so worn out ,
I &apos;m sorry ,
I just wanted to see Kin-san ,
I &apos;m so ashamed . I &apos;ve let him down , caused you trouble !
wait a minute , Shiraito !
don &apos;t go outside ! it &apos;s dangerous !
I can &apos;t impose on you two .
you &apos;ve got your lives here , I &apos;ll only be trouble to you ,
just stay a little while !
pul yoursef together , Shiraito !
think it out , You &apos;ve got to stay here !
we &apos;re not the kind of dogs who &apos;d forget your kindness !
whatever it takes , we &apos;ll protect you ! ,
they won &apos;t get you , Never !
Shraito ! you must pul yoursef out of this ,
please be strong ,
I &apos;m sorry ,
I &apos;m so sorry .. ,
the warmth of the young couple reached Shiraito &apos;s heart .
Shiraito , look what I &apos;ve got for you , Your favorite cherres ,
go on , have some , Cheer up ,
Shinzo , Forgive me ,
open up ! Shinzo !
open up here !
damn !
we &apos;l break in !

it &apos;s the poice !
if you don &apos;t , I &apos;l see that you &apos;re tried as an accomplce !
I &apos;l never open it !
tear down this door !
went out the back !
freeze !
not her ! just the wfe ,
you ousy rat ! ,
Shiraito ! quick , out the rear !
Shiraito !
Shiraito , you &apos;ve caused us enough troube with your drama .
finally Shiraito was brought back to Kanazawa ,
when the news that Taki no Shiraito had been charged with the murder of Iwabuchi the loan shark got out , the whole town came alive .
they &apos;ve arrested Shi raito !
Minami says he robbed her , but Shiraito says he didn &apos;t ,
doesn &apos;t make sense ,
exactly .
at any rate , it means that she &apos;s no innocent vrgin herself ,
you agree ? ,
what are you talking about !
I don &apos;t care what you say ! it &apos;s certain that Minami did it !
I know it !
examination by the judge ,
Hey ,
Mnami ! look at this knfe ,
this is one of your knives ,
you still say you didn &apos;t do it ? , Think anyone wil beieve you ? .
come on ! confess ! ,
your Honor , I just don &apos;t understand , I didn &apos;t do it !
you &apos;ve got to beieve me !
you say you stole money from Tak no Shiraito ,
nothing more ? .
no , sir .
and you dropped this knife when you were running away ?
in Kenroku Park ?
that &apos;s the truth ,
that just doesn &apos;t fit !
then what was ths knife doing in lwabuchi &apos;s house ? .
lying will get you nowhere ! ,
come on Shiraito , be a good gir , Tel me what happened ,
Mnami calms that he stole money from you ,
you say he didn &apos;t , Do you expect me to believe you ? .
he robbed you , didn &apos;t he ? .
there must be an expanation , Go ahead , you can tell me f Minam robbed you ,
it doesn &apos;t mean that I thnk you kiled lwabuchi ,
there &apos;s something strange about that money ,
what was that money for ? ,
if you tel the truth , I may be able to get you off .
don &apos;t you want to be free again ? ,
you , do you mean an acquitta ?
this coak is yours , Look at that blood ,
what can you tell me about this ? .
and this knife ? .
you can &apos;t stll claim that you weren &apos;t robbed !
you were robbed by Minami in Kenroku Park ,
where was the money from ? . what for ?
there must be a reason here ,
there &apos;s no doubt that you were robbed by Mnami !
tel me what happened !
tel me the truth !
what was it for ? .
tel me ! ,
I don &apos;t care what you say .
I wasn &apos;t robbed by Minami or anyone !
it was a complicated case ,
who is the real murderer ?
the town was abuzz with speculation as to who really killed Gozo Iwabuchi .
Shiraito gave up . she knew that there was no way out .
but she dreamt only of escaping for a short time .
if only she could see Kinya once before her execution ,
the murder trial to find the killer of Iwabuchi was near . the word was that the new prosecutor coming from Tokyo was a young man of great talent ,
I see ! starting to make sense ,
so , the result of the prelminary hearing ,
they found Minam gulty . look ! see here ?
it &apos;s not so simple ,
there &apos;l be a new prosecutor from Tokyo at the trial ,
they say he &apos;s quite something , Must go watch !
sharp as a knife I heard !
what are you taking about ? , You young fool !
a young prosecutor ? , Another young fool .
the truth &apos;s only known by God and yours truly !
Shiraito &apos;s innocent ! , Case closed ,
it &apos;s Minami ! who else but him !
Shiraito &apos;s no murderer !
quiet down , old man ,
I only speak of the truth !
no way that Taki no Shiraito killed that low-down lwabuchi !
old man . isn &apos;t it time you went home ? ,
you &apos;ve been here since this morning ,
the price is the same for one hour or ten hours !
come on old-timer , It &apos;s dnner time .
Shiraito &apos;s no crimna !
Winter &apos;s cold must precede the blossoms of spring ,
a time of joy , a season oflife , Here and there new faces appear .
her soul cleansed with clear water .
she is smiling happily somewhere ,
an eternal dream .
the new prosecutor wants to see you right away ,
move it ! let &apos;s go ,
come now ! , Taken to the prosecutor &apos;s office .
the trial date was nearing mercilessly .
brought her , sir ,
you may go ,
please sit down .
that voice ! Shiraito felt a chill ,
couldn &apos;t believe her eyes .
there was Kinya standing before her ,
he now an elegant prosecutor .
while she was ,
how miserable she felt .
she was a sinful murderer .
what a cruel and twisted fate .
her pride as the top beauty of the Hokuriku region was now shattered .
the joy of seeing him came to shatter her pride and confidence ,
but Kinya &apos; s success today was because of her years of support ,
she brought him to the world ,
that is when a new pride and joy grew in her heart ,
can you seep well ? ,
I s the food aright ? .
do you lack for anything ? .
I would stil be driving a carriage if not for you ,
you made me everythng I am ,
thank you very much ,
look at you ,
a nobleman , What more could I ask for ? ,
congratulations !
I longed to see you ,
I longed to see you ,
I longed to , see you , ..
you must have suffered for me for so long ,
I &apos;m sure you must hate me now .
please forgive me .
I longed to see you , just once before I died ,
had only that thought these past days ,
my wish has come true , I &apos;m here with you .
I have no more regrets ,
go on ! question me ,
you &apos;re the prosecutor !
I &apos;m a criminal !
question me ! do your job !
question me !
how coud I investigate you ? .
I can &apos;t , How coud I ? ,
all that came out was tears .
the time passed ,
time &apos;s up , Your Honor .
take her away ,
could there be a more cruel reunion for two lovers ?
the murder case of Iwabuchi the loan shark ,
was this case linked to that money ?
if that had been her , &quot; &apos;
ca me from far , H er clothes were soiled ,
a nice lookng woman , About 25 or 26 ,
there were tears in her eyes as she asked about you ,
the money that was left behind that time .
if that money is related to this incident then all that she had done was for my sake .
how could I prosecute her ?
it is I who ought to stand before the judge , &quot; &apos;
an honorable man , he made up his mind . Kinya would resign and stand trial .
both the crime and the punishment were his .
he would stand before court ,
Kinya came to Shiraito &apos; s cell .
everything that you did was for my sake .
it &apos;s only natural that I stand tral for you !
I couldn &apos;t stand there and watch you on tral ,
that &apos;s too hdeous !
I &apos;ll ... I &apos;ll stand trial !
what are you talking about ? .
you &apos;re a coward !
what about me ? . what of me after they execute you ?
I beg you ! please don &apos;t say such a thing ,
please !
I &apos;ve gven up all for your success , I have nothing left but you ,
I have no regrets dying now !
be a wise , honored man , and a respected prosecutor ! ,
grant me my last request !
fulfil your role as a wise and honored prosecutor !
I beg you !
don &apos;t fee sorry for me , But if you do , do your duty ,
for me , do it for me ! let my death be meaningfu !
her piercing words sunk deep in his heart .
to prosecute her was to return her love .
Kinya gave up his noble plan , and resolved himself to do his duty as a prosecutor .
the trial date finally came .
a new prosecutor from Tokyo , a man of talent and insight was coming .
and with the word that the great Taki no Shiraito will appear in court , there was a scramble for seats .
first of all came in Minami the Knife Thrower .
everyone waited , holding their breath .
silence filled the air .
Minami the Knife Thrower ,
this is one of the knives you use in your show ,
show us how you use it .
I get up on stage and take t lke this .
just lke that ,
that &apos;s my show right there ,
you &apos;ve stated that you lost ths knife in Kenroku Park ,
but it was found lying next to the victim ,
you deny kiling lwabuchi with this knife ? , Do you ?
I &apos;m no murderer ! I lost that knife !
I &apos;ve no part in his murder !
I &apos;m no such devil as a murderer !
why would I kil lwabuchi ? ,
I &apos;m no monster ! I &apos;m innocent .
all I did was , steal from Taki no Shiraito ,
you stole her money ? .
what about lwabuchi ? ,
I may have stolen some money , but I &apos;m no murderer ,
I &apos;m a good man at heart ,
have you got anythng else to say for yourself ? ,
no , Your Honor !
your Honor .
as prosecutor , I &apos;d like to call Taki no Shiraito , her real name Tomo Mizushima , to the stand ,
granted ,
the court calls
Tomo Mizushima ,
there was a stir in the room as Shiraito entered ,
tired and haggard , her beauty has not escaped her ,
rather she had the dignity of a person facing her own fate ,
t omo Mizushi ma , You &apos;ll be questioned about the murder of Gozo lwabuchi ,
Folow your conscence ,
tel the truth ,
&quot; tel ony the truth .
add nothing and omit nothing , Speak openly and honesty , &quot;
prosecutor Kinya Murakoshi ,
Tomo Mizushima ,
I , Kinya Murakosh , as the prosecutor , ask you to tel me the truth ,
speak ony of the truth ,
his resolute voice echoed in the room .
Kinya was now filled with dignity .
Shiraito was filled with joy .
how wise he &apos; s become ! &apos; &quot;
you say that you have no recolection of a robbery ,
I &apos; l stand for no lies ,
even if you get off on a lie , the truth will be known in heaven or hell someday ,
a common man can hide behind a veil of silence , but you &apos;re not ordnary .
think about t , Who are you ? , You &apos;re Taki no Shiraito !
would you dare sol that name with a ie ? ,
does it mean nothing to you ? .
men are mortal , we must die , But a name is forever ,
with fame ike yours , you must have many patrons ,
but imagine one of them watchng you here today .
what if he saw you lie and send another to his death ? ,
would he praise your deed ? . be gad you were found innocent ?
would he smile ? ,
if I were that man , and if you did such a thng ,
I would bid you farewel here and look away should our paths ever cross ,
if I were your patron , I would not want that ,
before things got to that , I would beg you to be strong ,
I would beg you to be honest and do what is right , no matter the cost .
I urge you to tell the truth ,
after she had Kinya fulfill his duty as a prosecutor ,
Shiraito finally told the truth ,
I was robbed .
Minami robbed me in the park that nght ,
see , Your Honor ? ,
I &apos;m innocent !
so you were robbed ? ,
Y es , Your Honor , I was robbed ,
what &apos;s the point in hiding ? ,
I had an oblgaton to my love ,
a student who I pedged my life to supportng ,
for the first two years
I got by somehow , sending him what I coud ,
but the third , I was at my wit &apos;s end . couldn &apos;t scrape any money together ,
I had to help the man I love , So I agreed to sleep wth lwabuch ,
for 300 yen !
that money meant more to me than my life !
but lwabuchi and this Minami here plotted to rob me ,
Minami knocked me out in Kenroku Park !
I wanted to kill mysef , But I coudn &apos;t ,
what would happen to him who depends on me ?
, No , I couldn &apos;t die ,
without thinking , I grabbed the knife Minami had left .
I went back to Iwabuchi &apos;s .
he grabbed me and threw me down , He was going to rape me again !
I strugged to free myself ,
and then ,
you stabbed hm ? .
you kiled him ? ,
I killed him .
there was al that money on the table ,
I needed that money !
how I wanted that money !
dd you take it ? .
I took it .
after seeing Kinya fulfill his duty , Shiraito bit out her tongue in the courthouse and wrote her own ending ,
not long after , Kinya followed her out of this world ,
he took a pistol to his head on the bank of Asano River .
the spring moon still glows . the snow still sparkles .
the river flows on as before and as it always will ,
Crimson tears shed for love that was not to be ,
on snowy nights when the gales blow hard , people in the Hokuriku region still tell the sad tale of Taki no Shiraito and Kinya Murakoshi .
the first and last reels are missing from this film . a Shochiku Film A Mother Should be Loved
at the breakfast table , father promises to take his sons to Shichirigahama on Sunday
after the father and children leave , his high school friend , Ozaki , calls to see if he will join the class reunion .
mother receives a disturbing phone call , informing her that he has collapsed .
she calls her sons &apos; school to bring them home .
go home now . something &apos;s happened to your father .
what &apos;s the matter with our father ?
I &apos;m afraid we won &apos;t be going to the beach now ...
was your father fine this morning ?
no one knows ...
Mr Okazaki is here to see you .
destiny is unpredictable . the one who rowed with us at school is dead ...
Uncle from Bancho acts like he &apos;s our father .
I &apos;d like to talk to you about this ...
it &apos;s not that serious , but ...
you might chide me , but I have a request . I ask as your husband &apos;s friend .
it &apos;s about the older son , Sadao .
please raise him as your own son , as you &apos;ve done till now .
I never treat Sadao differently from Kosaku .
I can swear it in front of my dead husband , and his late , first wife .
study hard and become a great man as your father was .
it &apos;ll be hard for you ...
but I am looking forward to the time when they grow up .
I &apos;m afraid our mother &apos;s at home , crying again .
her nose gets red when she cries .
time passes so quickly . Kosaku , will be in 4th grade at high school .
it is very sweet of him . he sent you a postcard on his school trip .
I haven &apos;t visited Kajiwara recently . I &apos;ll drop by today .
I got a letter from Kosaku .
they &apos;re growing up . you must be happy .
truthfully , Sadao just scolded me severely .
you were discreet , so he never suspected his upbringing .
but he saw his birth certificate when registering for college .
I &apos;ve never seen such a sad face in his entire life ...
your mother is worried about you . be kind to her like you used to be .
she kept it secret because she wanted you as her own son .
did she have any other choice ?
you also deceived me along with her !
you can &apos;t hide something like this forever .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ? I was bound to find out eventually !
I feel like I &apos;ve been tricked .
I wouldn &apos;t have been selfish if I &apos;d known .
I wouldn &apos;t have been impudent without knowing more ...
how can you say that to a mother who gave you everything ?
wake up and listen to me !
has your mother ever treated you and Kosaku differently ?
her only wish is that both of you become great men .
don &apos;t you realize the love she has for you ?
I &apos;m sorry , Uncle .
well , as long as you understand .
you &apos;ll never row well if you &apos;re narrow minded .
I &apos;m very sorry , mother !
I &apos;m truly your son .
I won &apos;t keep any secrets from now on .
let &apos;s move to the suburbs once Kosaku enters college .
Kosaku , help me !
Dad smoked cigars and often switched pipes .
a long gray hair .
he wore this hat at the flower exhibition . exactly a year before he died .
a splendid house ! you get so much sunshine ...
don &apos;t overdo it . it &apos;s a tiny house .
but , it &apos;s convenient and easy to take care of .
my husband was fond of this . please put it in your room .
it &apos;s been almost one year since Uncle died .
one &apos;s life is so fragile ...
everyone returns to the earth in the end ...
in college , uncle was the cox and Father was 5th oar .
the current Minister of Commerce was No. 4 oar .
I wish my husband could have seen Kosaku at college .
the ship leaves at 10 o &apos;clock .
let me ask my brother to come with us .
we &apos;re taking a round trip to Izu . why not join us ?
you &apos;re taking more leave from school ?
as long as mother agrees , go .
I &apos;ve got things to do .
have a safe trip .
anyway , we should get him out of the whorehouse .
we can &apos;t leave Hattori as he is .
let me go !
Hattori can &apos;t be that foolish .
come back with me .
why don &apos;t you take off your hat inside ?
get ready to leave !
everyone is so concerned about you .
it &apos;s hard to find a woman to love .
you call yourself one of our rowing team ?
please come back with me .
if you hate me , I don &apos;t mind if you hit me .
but , then , you must leave with me .
who let you take him ?
why don &apos;t you leave money for him here ?
you &apos;re pretending that you &apos;re a small insect ...
I can bring you money anytime .
why did you let him hit you ?
still , that boy was brave , wasn &apos;t he ?
one of my friends is in trouble . I need some money ...
so you &apos;re not going to Izu ?
mother says I shouldn &apos;t go .
we have much less money than we thought .
I &apos;m sorry to have troubled you .
Kosaku gave up his outing . how can I take your money now ?
he was just going for fun . but you &apos;re obligated to your friend .
why don &apos;t you go ? it &apos;s not too late .
never mind ! just go !
don &apos;t worry , I &apos;ll talk to mother .
mother , I &apos;m leaving anyway .
don &apos;t force your selfishness on your brother .
I gave him money . isn &apos;t that alright ?
Kosaku &apos;s been looking forward to this trip for so long .
I pity him if only I get money from you .
mother , you always favor my brother .
I feel the same way .
I &apos;m the only one who you always scold .
if you want to go that much , I don &apos;t mind .
if we take it like this , we won &apos;t make it before sunset .
I &apos;m dropping a line to my mother .
don &apos;t feel bad ! mine is Ms Kazu in the bakery .
you &apos;re such an ungrateful son !
you &apos;re even worse ! writing to your own mother ?
the sun is bright , I pulled out those clothes .
he should have worn it to climb the mountain .
Kosaku never wears such clothes .
why bother keeping such old fashioned clothes ?
even these can be worn if I alter them a little .
Kosaku should wear whatever &apos;s available ...
mother ... you &apos;re treating Kosaku differently again .
why not say I should also wear them ?
you &apos;re always doing that !
you told Kosaku all about your money worries , but not a word to me !
you never act like a real parent to me .
I never meant it that way ...
you always treat me special , no matter what .
please tell me what I should do to please you .
such reluctance bothers me .
why don &apos;t you hit me if you disagree ?
don &apos;t say that ...
you &apos;re treating us unfairly . I can &apos;t help it .
thanks for paying me last time .
you should take off your hat in my place .
you &apos;re an unruly son .
people with hangnails never listen to their parents .
I don &apos;t understand him .
why not apologize to Mother now you &apos;re back ?
what did you say to her ?
something really awful , I guess .
why did you make Mother cry ?
she &apos;s getting old , getting sentimental .
don &apos;t you think you &apos;ve done something wrong ?
she &apos;s the only mother we have .
no matter what your reasons , it &apos;s foolish to make her cry .
you &apos;re a terrible fool .
get out !
don &apos;t worry about me .
I can &apos;t stand aside if you speak ill of my mother .
why do you like mother so much ?
I &apos;ve started to hate her .
do you really mean that ?
have I ever lied to you ?
why don &apos;t you hit me back ?
why should I hit someone like you ?
I don &apos;t understand your concern over such a mother .
take good care of her !
who cares what happens to him ?
he &apos;s gone , after talking ill about both you and I .
mother , where are you going ?
do you really think he is like that ?
you always take his side .
he &apos;s never cared about you like you care for him .
I understand very well how Sadao feels .
he tried to do something good for us .
your brother isn &apos;t my real son .
he handled your entrance into college , because he didn &apos;t want you to know .
he tried to leave home for your sake .
he only maligns us because he wants us to give him up .
I was stupid .
no matter what happens , I &apos;ll bring him back .
then , he can hit me as much as he wants .
another day is gone ...
if you want to leave , go !
Hey , someone here to see you .
she &apos;s waiting downstairs .
what brings you here ?
I &apos;ve nothing to do with you .
I know you never mean that ...
I &apos;ve known you since you were a child .
if you know so much , then leave me alone .
I &apos;m happiest when I &apos;m left alone .
please come back with me .
unless you come home , I &apos;ll never get a good night &apos;s sleep .
Kosaku and your friends are hoping you &apos;ll come back .
sorry , your wish won &apos;t come true .
do you really think that one day
I &apos;ll take care of both you and Kosaku ?
I never want to live with you and Kosaku again .
your nose will get red if you cry more .
mother , I don &apos;t want hear anything from you .
it &apos;s useless , no matter what you say .
a great performance , wasn &apos;t it ?
I was almost shouting from the other side ...
aren &apos;t you hungry ?
you &apos;d better think about it ...
everyone has parents ... Never make your parents cry .
I &apos;ve got a son your age .
do you mean he &apos;s better than me ?
I &apos;d never do this if he &apos;d treated me better .
the eldest son eventually returned home , and all the various problems with each other were solved .
there years later , they moved to the suburbs .
there , they began a new life .
hunger strike ? how long has this been going on ?
she hasn &apos;t had a thing yesterday or today .
- Sending meals up to her regularly ?
- Yes , sir . why don &apos;t you jam it down her throat ?
it &apos;s not that simple , Mr. Andrews .
I &apos;ll talk to her myself . have some food brought up to her .
Yes , sir .
I won &apos;t eat a thing until you let me off this boat .
come now , Ellie . you know I &apos;ll have my way .
not this time , you won &apos;t ! I &apos;m already married to him .
you &apos;ll never live under the same roof with him . I &apos;ll see to it .
get it through your head , King Westley and I are married !
definitely , legally , actually married ! it &apos;s over , it &apos;s finished .
there &apos;s not a thing you can do about it . I &apos;m over 21 and so is he .
while you &apos;ve been onboard I &apos;ve arranged to have your marriage annulled .
annulled . I &apos;ll have something to say about that and so will King .
I expect him to .
the vittles . come in .
I told you not to bring any food in here . now wait a minute .
this isn &apos;t for you .
put it down here .
smart , aren &apos;t you ? so subtle .
strategy , my dear .
was it strategy sending those gorillas to drag me away from the Justice of the Peace ?
your idea of strategy is to use a lead pipe .
I &apos;ve won many arguments that way .
besides not liking him , you haven &apos;t got a thing against King . - He &apos;s a fake .
- He &apos;s one of the best flyers in the country .
he &apos;s no good . you married him because I said not to .
you &apos;re always telling me what not to do .
because you &apos;ve always been a stubborn idiot .
I come from a long line of stubborn idiots . don &apos;t shout so .
you may work up an appetite .
I &apos;ll shout if I want to ! I &apos;ll scream if I want to !
all right , scream .
let me off this boat or I &apos;ll break every piece of furniture in here !
have a nice piece of juicy steak . you don &apos;t have to eat it . just smell it .
it &apos;s a poem .
lower the boats ! catch her !
come on , men !
she got away , sir .
of course , she &apos;s too smart for you .
send a wireless to the Lovington Detective Agency .
&quot; daughter escaped again .
&quot; watch roads , airports and train stations in Miami . &quot;
Palm Beach , Savannah , Jacksonville New York , Philadelphia .
we &apos;re wasting our time . imagine Ellie Andrews riding on a bus .
I told the old man it was bunk .
ticket for New York , please .
- Here &apos;s your ticket .
- Thank you very much .
thank you .
what &apos;s going on here ? I &apos;d like to use that phone .
go away . this is history in the making .
- What ?
- There &apos;s a man biting a dog in there .
heel , boy . I can &apos;t stand this any longer .
in a pig &apos;s eye , you will .
listen monkey face , when you fired me , you fired the best news hound your filthy scandal sheet ever had .
you wouldn &apos;t know a newspaper story if it kicked you in the pants .
I got all your copy .
why didn &apos;t you tell me you were gonna write it in Greek ?
I &apos;d start a new department .
that was free verse , you gas house palooka .
what was free about it ? it cost this paper a gob of dough .
and it &apos;s not going to cost us any more !
Gordon .
did you know he reversed the charge ?
what ? why you ....
when you get back to New York , you keep far away from this office .
you &apos;re fired . you don &apos;t work here anymore and you never will .
what &apos;d he say ?
so , you &apos;re changing your tune ?
you &apos;re late with your apologies .
I wouldn &apos;t go back to work for you if you begged me on your hands and knees !
I hope this &apos;ll be a lesson to you .
did we tell that baby ?
- We don &apos;t need anymore of his lip .
- You told him , Pete . I guess he knows now , how I feel about his job .
I bet he does , too .
is my chariot ready ?
your chariot awaiteth withouteth , mighty King .
- Lead on , sire .
- Make way for the king .
make way for the king .
long live the king .
make yourself comfortable with a pleasant pillow .
pillow , sir ?
driver ! if you &apos;ll be good enough to move those newspapers , I &apos;ll have a seat .
Hey , wait a minute !
what do you think you &apos;re doing ?
the papers . what &apos;s the idea of throwing them out ?
the papers ? it &apos;s a long story , my friend .
I never did like the idea of sitting on newspapers .
I did it once , and all the headlines came off on my white pants .
it actually happened . nobody bought a paper that day .
they followed me all over town and read the news off the seat of my pants .
a fresh guy . what you need is a good sock on the nose .
listen partner , you may not like my nose , but I do .
I always wear it out in the open so if anybody wants to take a sock at it , they can .
Yeah ?
now , that &apos;s a brilliant answer . why didn &apos;t I think of it ?
our conversation could have been over long ago .
Yeah ?
if you keep that up , we won &apos;t get anywhere .
Yeah ?
you got me . Yeah !
excuse me , lady . but that upon which you sit is mine .
I beg your pardon ?
now listen , I put up a stiff fight for that seat .
so , if it &apos;s just the same to you , scram .
driver , are these seats reserved ? - No .
first come , first serve .
- Thank you .
these seats accommodate two people , don &apos;t they ?
maybe they do , maybe they don &apos;t .
thank you .
move over .
this is a &quot; maybe they do . &quot;
if you &apos;d ask me real nice , I might put that bag up there for you .
next time you drop in , bring your folks .
get some ! come on , everybody !
hot dogs , folks !
rest station , 15 minutes . we &apos;ll only be here 15 minutes .
red hot coffee !
right around there .
get the red hot coffee ! hot dogs !
can &apos;t enjoy the ride unless you eat !
he got away .
I found myself in the middle of brush and no sign of the skunk .
I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re raving about , young man .
- Furthermore , I &apos;m not interested . - Well of all the ....
maybe you &apos;ll be interested to know your bag is gone .
my heavens ! it &apos;s gone !
I knew you &apos;d catch on eventually .
- What am I going to do now ?
- Don &apos;t tell me your ticket was in it .
no , got that all right . but not my money .
all I have here is $ 4 .
you can wire home for money in Jacksonville .
no , I can &apos;t .
- Yes , I guess I will .
- I &apos;ll tell the driver about your bag .
thank you , I &apos;d rather you didn &apos;t .
don &apos;t be a fool . you &apos;ve lost your bag . the company should pay for it .
- What &apos;s your name ?
- I don &apos;t want it reported !
that &apos;s silly . the company will take care of it .
can you understand English ? would you please keep out of my affairs ?
I want to be left alone .
why , you ungrateful brat .
board !
all aboard !
Jacksonville , 30 minutes for breakfast .
only 30 minutes for breakfast .
just 30 minutes . that &apos;s all . no more .
I &apos;m so sorry .
silly , isn &apos;t it ?
why , everybody &apos;s gone !
thank you for that , very much .
- We &apos;re in Jacksonville , aren &apos;t we ?
that was foolish of me .
why didn &apos;t you shove me away ?
I hated to wake you up . you look kind of pretty asleep .
how about some breakfast ?
no thank you . no , I &apos;m going to the Windsor Hotel .
Windsor ? you &apos;ll never make it in time . we leave in a half an hour .
no , they &apos;ll wait for me .
driver , I &apos;m going to be a few minutes late . be sure to wait for me .
Yeah ?
Yes .
where &apos;s the bus to New York ?
it left about 20 minutes ago .
but that &apos;s ridiculous . I was on that bus . I told them to wait .
I &apos;m sorry , miss , but it &apos;s gone .
good morning . remember me ? I &apos;m the fellow you slept on last night .
seems to me , I &apos;ve already thanked you for that .
what time &apos;s the next bus ?
8 : 00 tonight .
8 : 00 ? that &apos;s 12 hours .
sorry , miss .
what &apos;s wrong ? wouldn &apos;t the old meanies wait for you ?
why are you so excited ? you missed it , too .
Yeah , I missed it too .
don &apos;t tell me you did it on my account .
I hope you haven &apos;t any idea that what happened last night is ....
young man , you needn &apos;t concern yourself about me .
I can take care of myself .
you &apos;re doing a pretty sloppy job of it . here &apos;s your ticket .
my ticket ?
I found it on the seat .
thank you . it must have fallen out of my purse .
you &apos;ll never get away with it , Miss Andrews .
- What are you talking about ?
- You won &apos;t get away with it .
your father will stop you before you get halfway to New York .
you must have me confused with someone else .
quit kidding . it &apos;s all over the front page .
I &apos;ve always been curious to know what kind of a girl would marry a front-page aviator like King Westley .
take my advice . grab the next bus back to Miami .
that guy &apos;s a phoney .
I didn &apos;t ask for your advice .
that &apos;s right . you didn &apos;t .
you &apos;re not going to notify my father , are you ?
what for ?
you probably could get some money out of him .
I never thought of that .
if you promise not to do it , I &apos;ll pay you as much as he will .
you won &apos;t gain a thing by giving me up .
I &apos;m willing to make it worth your while .
I &apos;ve got to get to New York without being stopped .
it &apos;s very important to me .
I &apos;d pay you now , only all I had when I jumped off the yacht was a watch .
I had to pawn it to get these clothes .
I &apos;ll give you my address . you can contact me in New York .
never mind .
I had you pegged right from the jump .
just the spoiled brat of a rich father .
the only way you get anything is to buy it .
you &apos;re in a jam and all you can think of is your money .
it never fails , does it ?
ever hear of the word &quot; humility &quot; ?
no , you wouldn &apos;t .
it never occurred to you to say &quot; Please , Mister , I &apos;m in trouble .
that &apos;d bring you down off your high horse .
I &apos;ll tell you something to ease your mind .
you don &apos;t have to worry about me .
I &apos;m not interested in your money or your problem .
you , King Westley , your father .
you send telegrams here ?
I &apos;m just fine , thanks . and how are you ?
&quot; to Joe Gordon , in care of New York Mail , New York .
&quot; am I laughing . the biggest scoop of the year just dropped in my lap .
&quot; I know where Ellen Andrews is . &quot; no , do you really ?
go on . send the telegram .
&quot; how would you like to have the story ? you big tub of .... &quot;
mush .
&quot; tub of mush . well , try and get it .
&quot; what I said about never writing another line for you still goes .
&quot; are you burning ? Peter Warne . &quot;
that &apos;ll be $ 2.60 .
- Send it collect .
- Collect ?
collect .
bus leaving for Savannah , Charleston , Columbia , Greensboro , Richmond Washington , Baltimore , Philadelphia , New York ....
Hi , sister . all alone ? my name &apos;s Shapeley .
may as well get acquainted , it &apos;s a long trip .
gets tiresome . especially for somebody like you .
you look like you &apos;ve got class .
Yes , with a capital &quot; K &quot; . I &apos;m the guy that knows class when he sees it .
believe you me . ask any of the boys . they &apos;ll tell you .
Shapeley sure knows how to pick them .
Shapeley &apos;s the name and that &apos;s the way I like them .
you made no mistake sitting next to me .
most girls you meet on the bus ain &apos;t nothing to write home to the wife about .
you gotta be awful careful who you hit it up with .
you can &apos;t be too particular , neither .
what &apos;s the matter , you ain &apos;t saying much ?
seems to me you &apos;re doing excellently without any assistance .
that &apos;s pretty good . &quot; seems to me you &apos;re doing excellently without any assistance . &quot;
well shut my big , nasty mouth .
looks like you &apos;re one up on me .
there &apos;s nothing I like better than to meet a high-class mama that can snap back at you .
the colder they are , the hotter they get .
that &apos;s what I always say .
Yes , sir .
when a cold mama gets hot , boy how she sizzles .
now you &apos;re just my type .
believe me , sister , I could go for you in a big way .
&quot; Fun-on-the-side Shapeley , &quot; they call me . with accent on the &quot; fun &quot; .
believe you me .
believe you me , you bore me to distraction .
looks like you &apos;re two up on me now .
Hey , you .
- There &apos;s a seat over there for you .
- What &apos;s the idea ?
I &apos;d like to sit next to my wife , if you don &apos;t mind .
- Your wife ?
- Yes .
come on .
Yeah . sure , excuse me . you know , I was just ....
sure . excuse me , miss . I was just trying to make things pleasant .
excuse me , I ....
I didn &apos;t mean anything , Doc .
- No offence , Doc . - No .
if you promise not to snap my head off , I &apos;d like to thank you .
forget it . I didn &apos;t do it for you . his voice gets on my nerves .
what &apos;d you do all day ?
ran in and out of doorways . trying to keep out of the rain .
your clothes are all wet .
here .
you &apos;re as helpless as a baby . thank you .
here you are , folks .
cigars , cigarettes , chewing gum , candy , magazines .
here , boy .
- Yes , ma &apos;am .
- A box of chocolates , please .
- Never mind . she doesn &apos;t want it .
- But ....
- Of course , I do . what do you mean ?
- Beat it .
well , you &apos;ve got your nerve . here , boy !
$ 1 .60 .
you had $ 4 last night .
how will you get to New York at this rate ?
that &apos;s none of your business .
you &apos;re on a budget from now on .
- Just a minute . you can &apos;t--
- Shut up .
- What &apos;s the matter , officer ?
- Bridge washed out .
looks like we can &apos;t get through till morning .
if any passengers want a place to sleep you &apos;ll find an auto camp up yonder a piece .
- Where ? - Right over there .
see those lights ?
Dyke &apos;s Auto camp .
all right , thanks . Hey , brat .
are you talking to me ?
Yeah . come on , we &apos;re stopping here for the night .
Hey ! come on , we &apos;re all set .
good evening . hope you and your husband rest comfortable .
come on ! what are you going to do , stay out there all night ?
darn clever , these Armenians ?
Yeah , it &apos;s a gift .
I just had the unpleasant sensation of hearing you referred to as my husband .
Yeah . I forgot to tell you about that . I registered as Mr. and Mrs .
you did ?
what am I expected to do ? leap for joy ?
I kind of half expected you to thank me .
your ego is absolutely colossal .
Yeah , it &apos;s not bad . how &apos;s yours ?
you know , compared to you , my friend Shapeley &apos;s an amateur .
just whatever gave you any idea I &apos;d stand for this ?
now wait a minute . let &apos;s get this straightened out right now .
if you &apos;re nursing any silly notion that I &apos;m interested in you , forget it .
you &apos;re just a headline to me .
a headline ?
you &apos;re not a newspaper man , are you ?
chalk up one for your side .
now listen . you want to get to King Westley , don &apos;t you ?
all right , I &apos;m here to help you . what I want is your story . exclusive .
a day-to-day account . all about your mad fight to happiness .
I need that story . between you and me , I &apos;ve got to have it .
isn &apos;t that just too cute .
there &apos;s a brain behind that face of yours , isn &apos;t there ?
you &apos;ve got everything nicely figured out for yourself . including this .
this ? well , that &apos;s a matter of simple mathematics .
these cabins cost $ 2 a night .
I &apos;m very sorry to inform you , wifey dear but the family purse won &apos;t stand for our having separate establishment .
thank you very much , sir . you &apos;ve been very kind . it &apos;s all right with me .
go on out in the storm .
but I &apos;m going to follow you . Yeah .
and if you get tough , I &apos;ll just have to turn you over to your old man .
right now . Savvy ?
that &apos;s my whole plot in a nutshell .
a simple story for simple people .
you behave yourself , I &apos;ll see you get to King Westley .
if not , I &apos;ll just have to spill the beans to Papa .
now , which of these beds do you prefer ?
this one ? all right .
that , I suppose , makes everything quite all right .
this ?
I like privacy when I retire . Yes , I &apos;m very delicate in that respect .
prying eyes annoy me .
behold the walls of Jericho .
maybe not as thick as the ones that Joshua blew down with his trumpet .
but a lot safer .
you see , I have no trumpet .
now to show you my heart &apos;s in the right place I &apos;ll give you my best pair of pyjamas .
do you mind joining the Israelites ?
you don &apos;t want to join the Israelites ? all right .
perhaps you &apos;re interested in how a man undresses . there &apos;s a funny thing about that .
quite a study in psychology .
no two men do it alike .
I once knew a man who kept his hat on until he was completely undressed .
now he made a picture .
years later , his secret came out . he wore a toupee .
I have a method all my own .
if you &apos;ll notice , the coat came first . then the tie . then the shirt .
now , according to Hoyle , after that the pants should be next .
there &apos;s where I &apos;m different .
I go for the shoes next .
first the right . then the left .
after that , it &apos;s every man for himself .
still with me , brat ?
don &apos;t be a sucker .
a good night &apos;s rest will do you a lot of good .
besides , you got nothing to worry about .
the walls of Jericho will protect you from the big bad wolf .
&quot; who &apos;s afraid of the big bad wolf ? the big bad wolf
&quot; the big bad wolf
&quot; she &apos;s afraid of the big bad wolf Tra , la , la , la , la &quot;
would you mind please , putting out the light ?
no , not at all .
I wish you &apos;d take those things off the walls of Jericho .
excuse me .
by the way , what &apos;s your name ?
what &apos;s that ?
who are you ?
who , me ?
I &apos;m the whippoorwill that cries in the night .
I &apos;m the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face .
you &apos;ve got a name , haven &apos;t you ?
Yeah , I got a name . Peter Warne .
Peter Warne .
I don &apos;t like it .
don &apos;t let it bother you . you &apos;re giving it back to me in the morning .
pleased to meet you , Mr. Warne .
the pleasure is all mine , Mrs. Warne .
- Another message , sir .
- What is it ? what is it ?
it &apos;s from Charleston . &quot; checking every northbound train .
&quot; also assigned 20 operators to watch main highways .
&quot; no sign of her yet . will continue to do all possible .
&quot; signed , Lovington Detective Agency . &quot;
it &apos;s just the same as all the others .
- Yes , sir ?
- I said I was in a hurry to get to New York . - What are we crawling for ?
- I got it wide open .
- All right , step on it .
I hope she &apos;s all right . all right ?
of course , she &apos;s all right . what could happen to her ?
- Nothing , sir .
- Then shut up about it .
Hello ?
Hey , mister .
Hello .
what &apos;s the matter , you not up yet ?
- What time is it ?
- 8 : 00 . here .
it &apos;s a toothbrush , thanks .
my dress , you had it pressed . come on .
breakfast will be ready soon .
you sweet thing . where &apos;d you get it pressed ?
I &apos;ll count to 10 .
if you &apos;re not out of bed by then I &apos;ll drag you out myself .
- One , two , three , four , five ....
- I really think you would !
I &apos;m out !
I &apos;m out !
you &apos;ll find the showers just behind the second cottage .
outside ?
all the best homes have them outside .
I can &apos;t go out like this . - Like what ?
- Like this .
I have no robe .
here , use mine .
thanks .
make it snappy .
wait , it &apos;s not my fault . you got the sleeve .
- Here are my puppets .
- Thanks .
where &apos;d you say the showers were ?
here &apos;s a towel .
thank you .
you &apos;re kind of little , aren &apos;t you ?
where &apos;s the shower ?
your hair &apos;s cute like that . you should never comb it .
I &apos;ll find it myself .
are the showers in there ?
they ain &apos;t out here .
thank you .
can &apos;t a body have a little privacy around here ?
you want a shower around here , you &apos;ll stand in line .
Hi , sister . you remember me , Shapeley ?
say , I &apos;m sorry about last night .
didn &apos;t know you was married to that guy . you should &apos;ve told me right off .
high time you got back .
I met some very interesting women at the showers .
we got chatting about this and that . you know how time flies .
come on .
my , my . scrambled eggs . egg .
one egg . one donut , black coffee . that &apos;s your ration till lunch .
any complaints ?
no . no complaints .
I &apos;d have cream for your coffee , but I &apos;d be buying a whole pint .
you don &apos;t have to apologise to me .
you don &apos;t know how much I appreciate all this .
what makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning ?
must be the spring .
I thought maybe &quot; believe you me &quot; told you some more snappy stories . no .
he apologised for last night .
said he didn &apos;t know we were married .
just shows you how wrong a guy can be .
- Donut ? - Thanks .
you think this whole business is silly ?
running away and all . no .
makes too good a story .
Yes , you do . you think I &apos;m a fool and a spoiled brat .
perhaps I am . although , I don &apos;t see how I can be .
spoiled people are used to having their way .
I never have . on the contrary .
I &apos;ve always been told what to do and how to do it and when and with whom .
can you believe , this is the first time I &apos;ve ever been alone with a man ? Yeah .
it &apos;s a wonder I &apos;m not panic-stricken .
you &apos;re doing all right .
thanks .
nurses , governesses , chaperones , even bodyguards .
it &apos;s been a lot of fun .
one consolation , you can never get lonesome .
it has its moments .
it &apos;s become a sort of game , trying to outwit father &apos;s detectives .
I did once . actually went shopping without a bodyguard . it was swell .
I felt absolutely immoral .
it didn &apos;t last long , they found me in a department store .
I was so mad , I ran out the back way and jumped into the first car I saw .
guess who was in it ?
Santa Claus ? Ghandi ?
King Westley was in it .
- Is that how you met him ? - Yes .
we rode around all afternoon .
father was frantic .
by 6 : 00 , he was having all the rivers dragged .
where &apos;d you learn to dunk , in finishing school ?
now don &apos;t you start telling me I shouldn &apos;t dunk . of course you shouldn &apos;t .
you don &apos;t know how .
Dunking is an art . don &apos;t let it soak so long .
a dip and sock , into your mouth .
you leave it in too long , it gets soft and falls off .
it &apos;s all a matter of timing . I &apos;ll write a book about it .
thanks , professor .
just goes to show you . $ 20 million , and you don &apos;t know how to dunk .
I &apos;d change places with a plumber &apos;s daughter any day .
how do I know who you are ? I never saw you before .
you can &apos;t go around bothering my tenants .
there &apos;s no girl by that name here .
how do I know you &apos;re detectives ?
show him your credentials , Mac .
detectives .
that &apos;s father at work . Peter , what &apos;ll I do ?
maybe I can jump out of the window .
they won &apos;t see me .
get yourself all mussed up .
get your hair down over your eyes and undo your buttons .
I got a letter from Aunt Bella last week .
she said if we don &apos;t stop over in Wilkes-Barre , she &apos;ll never forgive us .
what are you talking about ?
the baby &apos;s due next month . they want us to come .
she saw your sister on the street the other day . said she &apos;s looking swell .
come in .
I hope Aunt Bella has a boy , don &apos;t you ?
Grandma says it &apos;s gonna be a girl . she hasn &apos;t missed calling one in years .
man here to see you , sweetheart . who , me ?
you wanna see me ?
what &apos;s your name ?
- Are you addressing me ? - Yeah .
what &apos;s your name ?
wait a minute . that &apos;s my wife you &apos;re talking to .
what do you mean coming here ? what do you want ?
- We &apos;re looking for somebody .
- Fine , but don &apos;t come busting in here .
this isn &apos;t a public park .
I got news to take a sock at you .
- Take it easy . - The men are detectives .
even if they &apos;re the whole police department they can &apos;t bust in here , questioning my wife .
don &apos;t get so excited . he asked you a simple question . is that so ?
how many times have I told you not to butt in ?
you don &apos;t have to lose your temper !
as usual . every time I try to protect you .
at the elks dance , when that big Swede hit on you .
he did not ! I told you a million times .
he kept pawing you all over the dance floor .
he didn &apos;t . you were drunk . nuts !
just like your old man .
once a plumber &apos;s daughter , always a plumber &apos;s daughter .
there ain &apos;t an ounce of brains in your family .
Peter Warne , you &apos;ve gone far enough !
- Shut up !
- You see what you &apos;ve done ?
sorry , but you see , we &apos;ve gotta check up on everybody .
we &apos;re looking for a girl named Ellen Andrews .
daughter of that big Wall Street mogul .
too bad you &apos;re not looking for a plumber &apos;s daughter .
quit bawling !
I told you they were a perfectly nice married couple .
you weren &apos;t bad , jumping in like that .
- You &apos;ve got a brain .
- You &apos;re not so bad , yourself .
we could start a two-people stock company .
things get tough , we &apos;ll play to small town auditoriums .
we &apos;ll call this one , &quot; The Great Deception . &quot;
what about &quot; Cinderella &quot; or a real hot love story ?
no , too mushy .
I like mushy stuff .
quit bawling !
bus leaves in five minutes !
- What ?
- Your bus leaves in five minutes .
holy smoke , we &apos;re not even packed yet .
I &apos;m starting to think you couldn &apos;t find your way home .
this is the last session ....
- Yeah ?
- Telegram for you . - Bring it in .
- Another wire from Peter Warne .
Warne ? throw it in the wastebasket . wait a minute .
&quot; have I got a story . stop . it &apos;s getting hotter and hotter .
&quot; hope you &apos;re the same . &quot;
- Collect ? - Yes .
- If you accept another one , you &apos;re fired .
- Yes , sir .
and that gives me an idea for all of you .
I want action , Lovington , action .
- We can &apos;t do the impossible .
- It isn &apos;t impossible .
she &apos;s somewhere between here and Miami .
I want her found .
- I put extra men on , the whole way .
- That &apos;s not enough .
send in Clark and Brown .
- You sure she isn &apos;t with King Westley ? - No .
he &apos;s being trailed 24 hours a day .
he can &apos;t even get a phone call we don &apos;t know about .
I &apos;m worried . after all , something might have happened to her .
I don &apos;t think so .
brown , arrange a radio broadcast . Coast-to-coast hook up .
offer a reward of $ 10,000 for information on her whereabouts .
Clark , send the story to all of the newspapers .
some out-of-town papers may not have a picture of her .
wire this to them . I want the story to break right away .
now we &apos;ll get some action !
fine , that &apos;s fine .
you know that one about the man who flew on the trapeze ?
Yeah .
&quot; once I was happy but now I &apos;m forlorn
&quot; like an old coat that is tattered and torn
&quot; left in this wide world to weep and to mourn
&quot; betrayed by a maid in her teens
&quot; this maid that I loved she was handsome
&quot; and I tried all I knew how to please
&quot; but I never could please her one-quarter so well
&quot; as the man on the flying trapeze
&quot; he flies through the air with the greatest of ease
&quot; the daring young man on the flying trapeze
&quot; his actions are graceful , all the girls he does please
&quot; and my love he has stolen away &quot;
I know the second verse there .
&quot; now he &apos;d play with a miss like a cat with a mouse
&quot; his eyes would undress every girl in the house
&quot; perhaps he is better described as a louse And still people came just the same
&quot; now he smiles from the bar on the people below
&quot; and one night he smiled on my love
&quot; she blew him a kiss
&quot; and she hollered bravo And he hung by his schnozzle from above
&quot; he floats through the air with the greatest of ease
&quot; daring young man on the flying trapeze His actions are graceful
&quot; all the girls he does please And my love he has stolen away &quot;
do you mind if I take the third one ?
&quot; I wept and I whimpered I simpered for weeks
&quot; while she spent her time with the circus &apos; freaks
&quot; the tears were like hailstones that rolled down my cheeks
&quot; Alas , Alack and Alaska
&quot; I went to this fellow the villain , and I said
&quot; I &apos;ll see that you get your deserts
&quot; his thumb to his nose he put up with a sneer
&quot; he sneered once again and said no
&quot; he flies through the air with the greatest of ease
&quot; that daring young man on the flying trapeze
&quot; his actions are graceful The girls he does please
&quot; my love he has stolen away &quot;
- Everybody keep your seats .
- Thank the man for me , Peter .
it &apos;s the first comfortable position I &apos;ve been in all night .
&quot; she flies through the air with the greatest of ease
&quot; the daring young-- &quot;
what &apos;s the matter with you ? somebody help .
something happened to her .
look how pale she is .
let &apos;s give her a chance to snap out of it .
she &apos;ll be all right .
we ain &apos;t ate nothing since yesterday .
what happened to your money ?
ma spent it all on the tickets . we didn &apos;t know it was gonna be so much .
we shouldn &apos;t have come , I guess .
but Ma said there was a job waiting for her in New York and if we didn &apos;t go , she might lose it .
she &apos;ll be all right when she &apos;s had something to eat .
the next time we come to , you buy some food . now come on .
I shouldn &apos;t ought to take this . ma &apos;ll get mad . don &apos;t tell her .
you don &apos;t want her to get sick again .
no , but you might need it .
come on .
I got millions .
here . - Thanks .
- Come on , go back .
better phone for some help . go phone if you want to .
the nearest town is 10 miles away .
Yeah ?
say , buddy . like to take a look at my paper ?
travelling like this , you lose track of what &apos;s going on in the world .
take that story there , for instance .
if I was to see that dame , you know what I &apos;d do ?
no .
I &apos;d go fifty-fifty with you .
why ?
because I don &apos;t believe in hogging .
a bird that figures that way always ends up behind the eight ball .
that &apos;s what I always say .
what &apos;s on your mind ?
five G &apos;s or I crab the works .
let &apos;s get away from here and talk this over privately .
I knew she wasn &apos;t your wife all the time .
lucky thing , my running into you . just the man I need . - You made no mistake , believe me .
- I can use a smart guy like you .
- When you &apos;re talking to old man Shapeley ...
- Can you make a gat ?
huh ?
a gat . a rod .
- Got any fireworks on you ? - No .
I got a couple of machine guns in my suitcase . I &apos;ll give you one of them .
may have trouble up north . have to shoot it out with the cops .
if you manage , those five G &apos;s are as good as in the bag . maybe more .
I &apos;ll talk to the Killer , he &apos;ll take care of you .
killer ? Yeah .
the big boy . the boss of the outfit .
you &apos;re not kidnapping her , are you ?
what else , stupid ?
you don &apos;t think we &apos;re after that penny-ante reward ?
$ 10 , 000 ? chicken feed .
now listen , we &apos;re holding that dame for a million smackers .
say , I didn &apos;t know it was anything like this . you see , I &apos;ve got ....
what &apos;s the matter ? you getting yellow ?
I &apos;m a married man . I got a couple of kids . I can &apos;t afford to get ....
pipe down your mug before I ....
what are you trying to do , tell the whole world about it ?
listen , you &apos;re into this thing and you &apos;re staying in , get me ?
you know too much .
I won &apos;t say anything , honest I won &apos;t . how do I know that ?
I got a notion to plug you .
- Why should I take a chance with you ?
- Trust me , mister . I &apos;ll keep my mouth shut .
Yeah ?
what &apos;s your name ?
Oscar Shapeley .
- Where do you live ?
- Orange , New Jersey .
got a couple of kids ? Yes , sir .
just babies . a little golden-haired girl .
- You love them , don &apos;t you ?
- Yes , I do .
you &apos;re not thinking of--
- You keep your trap shut , all right ?
- Sure . - If you don &apos;t ....
- I &apos;ll keep my trap shut .
you ever hear of Bugs Dooley ?
Bugs Dooley ? no .
he was a nice guy , just like you . and he made a big mistake one day .
got a little too talkative .
- You know what happened to his kid ? - No .
I can &apos;t tell you .
but when Bugs heard about it he blew his brains out .
that &apos;s terrible .
he had it coming to him . he talked too much . I never talk .
I never say a word . word of honour .
I wouldn &apos;t want anything to happen to my kids . okay .
just remember that .
now beat it . sure , mister .
thanks . I always knew you guys were--
come on , scram . and stay away from that bus . sure .
anything you say .
- You wouldn &apos;t shoot me in the back ?
- If you don &apos;t beat it ....
I &apos;m going .
why do we have to leave the bus ? come on .
don &apos;t ask so many questions .
why ?
poor old Shapeley . you shouldn &apos;t have frightened him like that .
at the rate he &apos;s going , he &apos;s probably crossed two state lines by this time .
why did we have to leave the bus ?
when Shapeley stops running , he &apos;s going to start thinking , isn &apos;t he ?
I &apos;ve been doing a little thinking myself .
the next town we come to , you better wire your father .
what &apos;s the matter , are you weakening ? no .
I was just thinking of you . a starvation diet may not agree with you .
did you give that child all your money ?
I gave him nothing . you were the big-hearted gal .
all the money I had was that ten spot .
so I &apos;ve been thinking you better wire your father . no , sir .
I started out for New York and I &apos;m going to get there if I have to starve all the way .
okay .
what is this strange power this man Westley has over you women ?
here , take these .
- Hold on to them . get up on that log .
- That ?
get up on the log .
I wish you &apos;d stop being playful . so sorry .
you know , this is the first time in years I &apos;ve ridden piggyback .
this isn &apos;t piggyback .
- Of course it is .
- You &apos;re crazy .
I remember distinctly my father taking me for a piggyback ride .
- And he carried you like this ?
- Yes .
your father didn &apos;t know beans about piggyback riding .
my uncle has four children .
I &apos;ve seen them ride piggyback .
I &apos;ll bet there isn &apos;t a good piggyback rider in your family .
I never knew a rich man who could piggyback ride .
you &apos;re prejudiced .
show me a good piggy backer . I &apos;ll show you a real human .
take Abraham Lincoln for instance . a natural born piggy backer .
where do you get off with that stuffed-shirt family of yours ?
my father was a great piggy backer .
here , hold this a minute .
thank you .
how long does this keep up ? my feet are killing me .
this looks like the best spot .
we &apos;re not going to sleep out here , are we ?
I don &apos;t know about you , but I &apos;m going to give a good imitation of it .
Peter ?
what ?
I &apos;m awfully hungry .
it &apos;s just your imagination .
no it isn &apos;t .
I &apos;m hungry and scared .
you can &apos;t be hungry and scared both at the same time .
well , I am .
if you &apos;re scared , it scares the hunger out of you .
not if you &apos;re more hungry than scared .
all right , you win . let &apos;s forget about it .
I can &apos;t forget it . I &apos;m still hungry .
holy smoke ! why did I ever get mixed up with you ?
if I had any sense , I &apos;d be in New York by this time .
what about your story ?
taking a married woman back to her husband .
I turned out to be the prize sucker .
all right , come on . your bed &apos;s all ready .
I &apos;ll get my clothes all wrinkled .
- Then take them off .
- What ?
all right , don &apos;t take them off . do what you please , but shut up about it .
you &apos;re becoming awfully disagreeable lately .
you just snap my head off every time I open my mouth .
if being with me is so distasteful to you , you can leave .
you can leave any time you see fit .
nobody &apos;s holding you here .
I can get along .
Peter ?
Peter !
- What &apos;s the matter ?
- I was so scared ! what &apos;s got into you ?
I left for a minute to find you something to eat .
I know but ....
here , eat your head off .
I don &apos;t want it now .
- I thought you said you were hungry .
- I was , but--
but what ?
I was so scared , it scared the hunger--
holy jumping catfish . you drive a guy crazy .
it &apos;s liable to get chilly before morning .
better use this .
what are you thinking about ?
by a strange coincidence , I was thinking of you .
- Really ?
- Yeah .
I was just wondering what makes dames like you so dizzy .
what did you say we &apos;re supposed to be doing ?
hitchhiking .
you &apos;ve given me a very good example of the hiking .
where does the hitching come in ?
it &apos;s a little early yet . no cars out .
if it &apos;s the same to you I &apos;m going to sit right here and wait until they come .
you got a toothpick ?
- What &apos;s the matter ?
- I got hay in my teeth .
no , I haven &apos;t got a toothpick . here , I got a penknife , though .
now hold still .
- Be careful .
- All right . where is it ?
all right , now hold still .
here . get it ?
thanks .
you should have swallowed that .
you won &apos;t have any breakfast , you know ?
you needn &apos;t rub it in .
- What are you eating ?
- Carrots .
- Raw ?
- Want one ? no .
why didn &apos;t you get me something I could eat ?
that &apos;s right , I forgot . the idea of offering a raw carrot to an Andrews .
you don &apos;t think I &apos;m going around panhandling for you , do you ?
have one of these . best thing for you , carrots .
I hate the horrid things .
I wish you wouldn &apos;t talk so much . now we let a car get away .
and suppose nobody stops for us ?
they &apos;ll stop all right . it &apos;s a matter of knowing how to handle them .
and you &apos;re an expert I suppose . expert .
and I &apos;ll write a book about it . call it &quot; The Hitchhiker &apos;s Hail . &quot;
there &apos;s no end to your accomplishments , is there ?
- You think it &apos;s simple ? - No .
well , it is simple .
it &apos;s all in that old thumb , see ?
some people do it like this . or like this .
all wrong . never get anywhere .
the poor things .
but that old thumb never fails . it &apos;s all a matter of how you do it , though .
now you take No. 1 , for instance .
that &apos;s a short jerky movement , like this . that shows independence .
you don &apos;t care if they stop or not .
- Clever .
- No. 2 , that &apos;s a little wider movement .
smile goes with this one , like this .
that means you got a brand-new story about the farmer &apos;s daughter .
you figured that out all by yourself ?
that &apos;s nothing . No. 3 , that &apos;s a pip . that &apos;s the pitiful one .
when you &apos;re broke and hungry , everything looks black .
it &apos;s a long sweeping movement like this . gotta follow through , though .
that &apos;s amazing .
but it &apos;s no good , if you haven &apos;t got a long face to go with it .
here comes a car . okay .
now watch me . I &apos;m gonna use No. 1 .
keep your eye on that thumb , baby , and see what happens .
I still got my eye on the thumb .
something must have gone wrong . I &apos;ll try No. 2 .
when you get to 100 , wake me up .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ll write that book after all .
think of all the fun you had , though .
you mind if I try ?
you ?
don &apos;t make me laugh .
you &apos;re such a smart aleck . nobody knows anything but you .
I &apos;ll stop a car and I won &apos;t use my thumb .
what are you gonna do ?
it &apos;s a system all my own .
aren &apos;t you going to give me a little credit ?
what for ?
I proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb .
why didn &apos;t you take off all your clothes ? you could have stopped 40 cars .
I &apos;ll remember that when we need 40 cars .
so , you &apos;re just married ? that &apos;s pretty good .
but if I was young , that &apos;s the way I &apos;d spend my honeymoon . hitchhiking .
Yes , sir . &quot; hitchhiking down the highway
&quot; of love on a honeymoon
&quot; hitchhiking down the highway , down &quot; Aren &apos;t you afraid you &apos;ll burn out a tonsil ?
tonsil ?
me ? no .
me burn a tonsil ? &quot; my tonsils won &apos;t burn &quot;
all right , let it go .
&quot; turn &quot;
how about a bite to eat ?
- That would be lovely .
- No thanks , we &apos;re not hungry .
young people in love are never hungry . no .
&quot; young people in love
&quot; are very seldom hungry
&quot; people in love are very seldom hungry &quot;
what were you going to do ? gold dig that guy for a meal ?
sure , I was . no fooling , I &apos;m hungry .
eat a carrot .
no .
I &apos;m going in to ask him .
you do and I &apos;ll break your neck .
come on , let &apos;s get out of here . stretch our legs .
I &apos;m sorry ....
that &apos;s all right .
Hey ! come here !
you &apos;ve got my suitcase !
what happened to you ? I was worried . - Get in .
- Look at your face !
you &apos;ve got a cut ! well , what happened ?
a road thief .
picks people up , runs off with their things . what a racket .
how &apos;d you get the car ?
I gave him a black eye for it and had to tie him up to a tree .
can &apos;t be much gas left in this thing .
gotta start promoting some .
better take the things out of the pocket of that coat .
that &apos;ll be good for ten gallons .
I haven &apos;t changed my mind , Westley . I want you to understand that .
I don &apos;t like you . never have . never will .
now that &apos;s clear enough , isn &apos;t it ?
you &apos;ve made it evident by your threats of annulment .
it hasn &apos;t worried me for a minute .
Ellie and I got married because we love each other .
she &apos;s proving it .
as far as I &apos;m concerned , there &apos;s going to be no annulment .
I see . you &apos;ve got hold of a good thing and you &apos;re going to hang on to it ?
all right , you win . I &apos;ll just have to get used to you .
I admit , I &apos;m licked . but it &apos;s only because I &apos;m worried .
if I don &apos;t find her soon , I &apos;ll go crazy .
I could have helped if it hadn &apos;t been for you .
I &apos;ve been watched so closely--
I know . well , you can help now . I &apos;ve got a room full of reporters in there .
now , I want you to make a statement .
say that we &apos;ve talked things over and come to an understanding .
and that if she returns I won &apos;t interfere with your marriage .
- All right ? - Yeah , that &apos;s quite all right .
okay .
I hope you and your wife spend a pleasant week with us .
so do I. Thank you . Goodnight . Goodnight .
- All right , brat .
- Any luck ? Yeah .
he finally agreed to let us have a cabin .
what about the money ?
I talked him out of that idea . he thinks we &apos;re staying a week .
- I must think something up before morning . - That &apos;s swell .
Yeah ?
I &apos;m glad you think so . if you ask me , I think it &apos;s foolish .
I told you there &apos;s no use in staying here .
we can make New York in three hours .
I thought you were in a hurry to get back .
whoever heard of getting in at 3 : 00 in the morning ?
everybody will be asleep .
okay . cottage no . 6 .
there you go , trusting people again . how many times did I tell you--
but he looked like a nice , upright young fellow , Ma .
we &apos;re on the last lap .
tomorrow morning , you &apos;ll be in the arms of your husband .
Yeah .
you &apos;ll have a great story , won &apos;t you ? Yeah .
swell .
thanks .
we certainly outsmarted your father .
I guess you ought to be happy .
am I going to see you in New York ?
Nope .
why not ?
I don &apos;t make it a policy to run around with married women .
there &apos;s no harm in your coming to see us .
not interested .
won &apos;t I ever see you again ?
what for ? I &apos;ve served my purpose !
I brought you back to King Westley .
that &apos;s what you wanted , wasn &apos;t it ?
have you ever been in love , Peter ?
me ?
Yes .
haven &apos;t you ever thought about it at all ?
it seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy .
sure , I &apos;ve thought about it . who hasn &apos;t ?
if I could ever meet the right sort of girl .
where are you gonna find her ?
somebody that &apos;s real . somebody that &apos;s alive .
they don &apos;t come that way anymore .
have I ever thought about it ?
I &apos;ve even been sucker enough to make plans .
I saw an island in the Pacific once .
never been able to forget it .
that &apos;s where I &apos;d like to take her .
she &apos;d have to be the sort of a girl who &apos;d jump in the surf with me and love it as much as I did .
nights when you , the moon and the water all become one .
you feel you &apos;re part of something big and marvellous .
that &apos;s the only place to live .
the stars are so close overhead you feel you could reach up and stir them around .
I &apos;ve been thinking about it .
boy , if I could ever find a girl who was hungry for those things .
take me with you , Peter . take me to your island .
I want to do all those things you talked about .
you better go back to your bed .
I love you . nothing else matters . but we can run away .
everything will take care of itself .
please , Peter I can &apos;t let you out of my life now .
I couldn &apos;t live without you .
you &apos;d better go back to your bed .
I &apos;m sorry .
did you mean that ? would you really go ?
all I &apos;m asking is enough gas to get me to New York .
that bag &apos;s worth $ 25 .
I got a bag . I got one for Christmas--
here &apos;s what I &apos;ll do .
I &apos;ll come back in the morning and buy it back from you with a $ 10 profit .
- What do you say ?
- I ain &apos;t got a hat . - What ?
- I ain &apos;t got a hat .
well , you got one now . come on , fill her up .
where you been all this time ? everybody &apos;s been asking about you .
get me one drink .
nobody disturbs me for the next half hour .
sure , boss .
Hello , Agnes .
- Don &apos;t . he &apos;ll shoot you on sight .
- Haven &apos;t been shot at in days .
- Get out of here ! get out !
- Now listen , Joe . don &apos;t &quot; Joe &quot; me .
all right , Joe .
you know I &apos;ve always liked you .
anytime I could help you , ran across a good story I came running to you with it .
I got one now .
the wires were on the level . the biggest scoop ever .
- It &apos;s yours . - About the Andrews kid ?
I &apos;ve got it all written up , ready to go .
a $ 1,000 ? get out of here before--
don &apos;t get sore . you gotta do this for me .
I need a $ 1,000 and I need it quick . I &apos;m in a jam .
what &apos;s the $ 1,000 for ?
to tear down the walls of Jericho .
never mind .
if I told you that Ellen Andrews will annul her marriage ?
- She &apos;ll marry somebody else .
- You &apos;re drunk .
would such a story be worth $ 1,000 to you ?
- If it was on the level .
- I got it , Joe .
- Who &apos;s the guy she &apos;s gonna marry ?
- I am .
- You ?
- Yes .
now I know you &apos;re drunk . I &apos;m going home . don &apos;t annoy me anymore .
for heaven sakes ! stop being an editor for a minute .
we know each other . you ought to know when I &apos;m serious .
this is on the level . I met her on a bus from Miami .
I &apos;ve been with her every minute . I &apos;m in love with her .
you gotta get me this money now , quick . minutes count .
she &apos;s waiting for me outside Philadelphia .
I gotta get right back . she doesn &apos;t even know I &apos;m gone .
a guy can &apos;t propose to a gal without a cent in the world , can he ?
what a story . on her way to join husband , Ellen Andrews--
that &apos;s it .
let me see that a minute .
Zeke ! I told you , you couldn &apos;t trust him .
he &apos;s gone .
who ?
the fella who was gonna stay a week .
he skipped and took the car with him , too .
we wouldn &apos;t have known till morning if I hadn &apos;t took that magnesia .
get up , don &apos;t lay there . let &apos;s do something about it .
there ain &apos;t nothing we can do if he &apos;s gone .
see that ? they &apos;re gone .
looks like it , don &apos;t it ? what &apos;s this ?
ma ! here &apos;s the woman .
- What &apos;s the matter ?
- Where &apos;s your husband ?
- Husband ?
- Yes , if he is your husband .
- Isn &apos;t he here ? - No , he ain &apos;t .
the car &apos;s gone , too .
you got any money ?
- Then you &apos;ll have to git !
Yeah . you &apos;ll have to git .
please , may I use your phone ? I &apos;ve got to call New York .
you ain &apos;t gonna stick me for no phone call .
go to the sheriff &apos;s office , a quarter mile down the road .
and listen , next time you better not come back here .
I run a respectable place .
- Thanks , you saved my life . - Okay .
so long kid and good luck .
Goodbye . you &apos;re beautiful . all women are beautiful .
for my dough , he &apos;s still the best newspaper man in the business .
get Hank , quick . boy , what a yarn .
hold up the morning edition .

I want a cartoon and I want it quick .
Westley &apos;s in it . he &apos;s waiting at the church with tears on his face .
the bride didn &apos;t show up .
old Man Andrews is laughing his head off .
everything exaggerated .
snap into it . what is it ?
Ellen Andrews ? you &apos;re crazy . I &apos;m not .
she phoned her father from an auto camp asking him to come .
he &apos;s getting a police escort and Westley &apos;s going along .
Yes , she &apos;s been travelling by bus .
when she found out her father and Westley made up , she phoned .
okay , grab a car and stay with them . get Hank again .
Agnes , get me a doctor , I &apos;m gonna have a nervous breakdown .
Hank , forget what I told you . I &apos;m having a nightmare .
Agnes , you call the police department . tell them to find Peter Warne .
send out a general alarm . I want that dirty crook pinched .
you want us ?
change the front page !
Ellen Andrews just phoned her father .
she &apos;s going home . she found out Dad withdrew his objections .
she gave herself up . spread it all over the place !
play it up big ! Major league ! &quot; love Triumphant . &quot; go on , hop to it .
okay .

&quot; young people in love are never hungry &quot;
come on , baby . we &apos;ve got a police escort .
come on , baby . they can &apos;t make a sucker out of us .
all right , come on . step back . give them room .
come on , step back .
how about a picture for the paper , Mr. Andrews ?
wait till she gets home . later , boys . later .
&quot; he floats through the air with the greatest of ease
&quot; the daring young man on the flying trapeze &quot;
get that thing out of the way !
keep your britches on , we &apos;ll get it out .
Hey , you darn fool !
Ellen Andrews is going to marry that Westley guy again .
Gordon &apos;s out back some place .
when he comes in , give him this . tell him I was just kidding .
- You can &apos;t get a thing done around here .
- Peter was just in . - What ?
- He left this money .
- He said he was just kidding .
- Where is he ?
- There he goes .
- Hey , Pete !
I &apos;m sorry , it was just a little gag . I thought I &apos;d have some fun with you .
Yeah , sure you had me going for a little while , too .
- It wouldn &apos;t have made a bad story at that . - No , great .
but that &apos;s the way things go .
you think you &apos;ve got a great yarn and then something comes along and messes up the finish .
and there you are . Yeah .
where am I ?
when you sober up , come in and talk to me .
thanks .
Ellie ?
Hello , Dad .
I knocked several times .
I &apos;m sorry . I must have been daydreaming .
everything &apos;s set . creating quite a furore , too .
great stunt King is going to pull .
stunt ?
Yeah , he &apos;s landing on the lawn in an autogyro .
Yes , I heard .
personally , I think it &apos;s silly , too .
you look lovely , child .
are you pleased with the gown ?
Ellie ?
the gown . Yes , it &apos;s nice , isn &apos;t it ?
what &apos;s the matter , child ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing .
you haven &apos;t changed your mind about King have you ?
no .
because if you have , it isn &apos;t too late . you know how I feel about him .
well , you gave me such a scare when I couldn &apos;t find you .
you know , the old pump isn &apos;t what it used to be .
I &apos;m sorry , Father .
I wouldn &apos;t hurt you for anything in the world .
aren &apos;t you happy ?
I thought so .
I knew there was something on your mind . there , now .
what &apos;s the matter ?
you haven &apos;t fallen in love with someone else , have you ?
have you ?
I haven &apos;t seen you cry since you were a baby .
this must be serious .
where &apos;d you meet him ?
on the road .
now don &apos;t tell me you &apos;ve fallen in love with a bus driver ?
Oh , no . who is he ?
I don &apos;t know very much about him .
except that I love him .
if it &apos;s as serious as all that , we &apos;ll move heaven and earth to--
no , it &apos;s no use . he despises me .
come now .
Yes , he does . he despises everything about me .
he says that I &apos;m spoiled and selfish and pampered and thoroughly insincere .
ridiculous .
he doesn &apos;t think so much of you , either .
well , I--
and he blames you for everything that &apos;s wrong with me .
he says you raised me stupidly .
and now that &apos;s a fine man to fall in love with .
he &apos;s marvellous .
what are we going to do about it ? where is he ?
- I don &apos;t know .
- I &apos;d like to have a talk with him .
it wouldn &apos;t do any good . I practically threw myself at him .
under the circumstances , don &apos;t you think we &apos;d better call this thing off ?
no , I &apos;ll go through with it .
but that &apos;s silly . seeing the way you feel about him .
no , it doesn &apos;t matter . I don &apos;t want to stir up any more trouble .
I &apos;ve done it all my life .
I &apos;ve made your life miserable . and mine , too .
I &apos;m tired , father . I &apos;m tired of running around in circles .
he &apos;s right , that &apos;s what I &apos;ve been doing ever since I can remember .
I &apos;ve got to settle down .
it doesn &apos;t matter how , where , or with whom .
you &apos;ve changed , Ellie .
I can &apos;t walk out on King now . it would make us all look so ridiculous .
anyway , what difference does it make ?
I &apos;ll never see Peter again .
is that his name ?
Peter Warne .
Peter Warne .
why , do you know him ?
why , no .
father , you haven &apos;t heard from him , have you ?
- Don &apos;t be silly , of course .
- Please , what &apos;s that ?
I guess that was his only interest in me , wasn &apos;t it ?
- The reward .
- I &apos;m sorry you read it .
- Are you going to see him ?
- I suppose so .
certainly . pay him off . he &apos;s entitled to it .
he kept me thoroughly entertained . it &apos;s worth every penny he gets .
thank you , Mary . that &apos;s just what I needed .
Mr. Westley &apos;s on his way up .
fine , have him come in .
I &apos;ll be going .
if it isn &apos;t the bridegroom himself . you &apos;re just in time , King .
how are you , Ellie ?
you happy ?
happy ? why shouldn &apos;t I be happy ?
here we are , let &apos;s drink .
it &apos;s up to you now . I want our life to be full of excitement .
we &apos;ll never let up , will we ? never a dull moment .
we &apos;ll get on a merry-go-round and never get off .
- Promise you &apos;ll never let me get off .
- Whatever you say , darling . it &apos;s a promise .
Yeah . who ?
why can &apos;t I see you at your office ?
I &apos;m leaving for Washington tonight . I may be gone several weeks .
I thought , perhaps , you &apos;d like to get this thing settled .
but I don &apos;t like the idea of butting in on your jamboree .
between you and me , those things give me a stiff pain .
you don &apos;t have to see anybody . you can come directly to my study . no .
why do I wanna--
Hey , wait a minute . maybe I will come over . Yeah .
I &apos;d like to get a load of that three ring circus you &apos;re pulling .
I wanna see what love looks like when it &apos;s triumphant .
I haven &apos;t had a good laugh in a week .
Mr. Warne ?
Yeah .
- Sit down .
- Thanks .
I was surprised to get your note . my daughter hadn &apos;t told me anything about you . about your helping her .
that &apos;s typical of your daughter .
takes those things for granted .
why did she think I lugged her from Miami ?
she thinks you &apos;re entitled to anything you can get .
she does ? isn &apos;t that sweet of her ? you don &apos;t , I suppose .
well , I don &apos;t know . I &apos;ll have to see on what you base your claim .
I presume you feel justified .
if I didn &apos;t , I wouldn &apos;t be here . I got it all itemised .
&quot; cash outlay , $ 8.60 . top coat , $ 15 .
&quot; suitcase , $ 7.50 . hat , $ 4 .
&quot; three shirts , $ 4.50 . Total , $ 39.60 .
&quot; all of the above items had to be sold to buy gasoline . &quot;
and I sold some shorts and socks , too . I &apos;m throwing those in .
- Yes , I know .
- What &apos;s the matter ? isn &apos;t it cheap enough ?
trip like that &apos;d cost you a $ 1,000 , maybe more .
now , let me get this straight .
you want $ 39.60 in addition to the $ 10,000 ?
what 10,000 ?
the reward .
who said anything about a reward ?
I &apos;m afraid I &apos;m a little bit confused . I assumed--
all I want is $ 39.60 .
if you give me a check for it , I &apos;ll get out of this joint .
it gives me the jitters .
- You &apos;re a peculiar chap .
- We &apos;ll go into that some other time .
the average man would go after the reward .
did anybody ever make a sucker out of you ?
it &apos;s a matter of principle . you probably wouldn &apos;t understand .
when anybody takes me for a buggy ride , I don &apos;t like paying for the privilege .
were you taken for a buggy ride ?
Yes . with all the trimmings . so how about the check , do I get it ?
- Certainly .
- Thanks .
here you are .
thank you .
do you mind if I ask you a question , frankly ?
do you love my daughter ?
any guy in love with your daughter should be examined .
now that &apos;s an evasion .
she picked herself a perfect running mate , King Westley .
the pill of the century .
she needs a guy that &apos;d sock her once a day whether it &apos;s coming to her or not .
if you were wiser , you &apos;d have done it yourself long ago .
do you love her ?
a normal man couldn &apos;t live with her without going nutty .
she &apos;s my idea of nothing .
I asked you a simple question ! do you love her ? Yes !
now don &apos;t hold that against me ! I &apos;m a little screwy myself !
here &apos;s to the merry-go-round .
perfect . now you look natural .
- I hope you got your money .
- You bet I did .
- Congratulations .
- Thanks . same to you .
stay around and watch the fun . you &apos;ll enjoy it immensely .
I would , but I &apos;ve got a weak stomach .
- I just had a long talk with him .
- I &apos;m not interested .
now just a minute , Ellie .
I don &apos;t want to hear another word about him .
come on , folks . King Westley has arrived .
here they come , boys . turn them over .
you &apos;re a sucker to go through with this .
that guy , Warne , is okay .
he didn &apos;t want the reward . all he asked for was $ 39.60 .
it &apos;s what he spent on you . said it was a matter of principle .
you took him for a ride .
he loves you , Ellie . he told me so .
you don &apos;t want to be married to a mug like Westley .
I can buy him off for a pot of gold .
and you can make an old man happy .
and you won &apos;t do so bad for yourself .
if you change your mind , your car &apos;s waiting at the back gate .
dearly beloved , we are gathered together here in the sight of God and in the face of this company , to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony .
if any man can show just cause why they may not lawfully be joined together , let him now speak or else , hereafter forever , hold his peace .
King , will thou have this woman to thy wedded wife so long as you both shall live ?
I will .
Ellen , will thou have this man to thy wedded husband so long as you both shall live ?
Ellen !
Ellie !
what happened ?
I haven &apos;t the slightest idea .
don &apos;t want to talk to you . don &apos;t want to talk to anybody .
don &apos;t want to see anybody .
but it &apos;s King Westley on the phone .
Hello , my would be ex-son-in-law .
I &apos;ve sent you a check for $ 100,000 .
that &apos;s the smartest thing you ever did , Westley , not to contest that annulment .
that &apos;s satisfactory , isn &apos;t it ? it ought to be .
I &apos;m not complaining . not complaining . it was dirt-cheap .
don &apos;t fall out of any windows !
there &apos;s another wire from Peter . they &apos;re in Glen Falls , Michigan .
&quot; what &apos;s holding up the annulment , you slowpoke .
&quot; the walls of Jericho are toppling . &quot;
send him a telegram right away . just say , &quot; Let them topple . &quot;
- Funny couple , ain &apos;t they ?
- Yeah .
if you ask me , I don &apos;t believe they &apos;re married .
they &apos;re married , all right . I just seen the license .
they made me get them a rope and a blanket , on a night like this .
what do you reckon that &apos;s for ?
blamed if I know . I just brought them a trumpet .
a trumpet ?
they sent me to the store to get it .
what in the world do they want a trumpet for ?
don &apos;t know .
how often do I have to tell you ... that Sophia Frederica is no longer to play with toys .
she &apos;s almost seven now .
don &apos;t smoke in here .
the child is sick .
I work day and night to arrange an advantageous marriage someday , and you undo everything .
how am I to make it clear to you that Sophia might one day become a queen ?
I don &apos;t want to be a queen , Mother .
I want to be a toe dancer .
be quiet , Sophia .
you &apos;re going to marry a king if I have anything to do with it .
stick out your tongue , Your Highness , and say &quot; ahh . &quot;
ahh .
not as bad as I thought .
we &apos;ll build her a nice harness ... and she &apos;ll have to wear it for about a year .
put those toys away .
I don &apos;t want to see them again !
you &apos;ll grow up to be a tall and beautiful woman .
I must be off on one of my operations .
don &apos;t let them frighten you , darling .
&quot; a nice harness &quot; !
what is he , a horse doctor ?
you fatter him .
our learned medico is going to perform one of his operations with an axe .
- He &apos;s the public hangman .
- Hangman ?
what &apos;s a hangman ?
can I become a hangman someday ?
a hangman is an executioner , the man who takes heads off skilfully .
sometimes that profession becomes the sport of titles .
I was about to read to you ... of Peter the Great and Ivan the Terrible ... and other Russian tsars and tsarinas who were hangmen .
stop walking , August .
you make me nervous .
&#91; girl &#93; Your Highness !
your Highness !
your Highness !
your Highness , a letter from the king .
your father wishes to see you at once .
sit down , my child .
we have been honoured with a communication from His Majesty ... which concerns you principally .
&quot; we , by Divine Grace Frederick , king of Prussia ...
&quot; have , after a series of negotiations ...
&quot; decided to honour your family by selecting your daughter ...
&quot; Sophia Frederica to forthwith set out for Russia ...
&quot; and there to become the bride of His Serene Highness , Peter Feodorovich ...
&quot; Grandson of Peter the Great , nephew of Her Imperial Majesty ...
&quot; and heir presumptive to the throne .
&quot; within the week , an emissary will arrive ...
&quot; to escort your daughter and her mother ...
&quot; Princess Johanna Elizabeth , to the court at Moscow
&quot; please inform her that she is to follow dutifully ...
&quot; the advice of Her Majesty &apos;s ambassador ...
&quot; and extend to her , as well as to your entire family ... my fond greetings and affections .
Fredericus Rex . &quot;
grand duchess of Russia !
not bad for this family .
I wonder what he looks like .
that unimportant detail can be settled when the ambassador gets here .
come , August , we shall reply to the king at once .
one must strike while the iron &apos;s hot .
come with me .
this is the Countess Cecilia , a cousin on my mother &apos;s side .
and this is her sister , Maria , and this-
your Highness may now come down .
this is Count Alexei , field marshal of the Russian Army ... grand master of the hunt ... lord of the chamber and ambassador extraordinary ... from Her Divine Majesty , Elizabeth of Russia .
this is my daughter Sophia .
although for a long time we &apos;ve heard about your beauty , Your Highness ...
I must confess , I was not prepared to see such a vision of loveliness .
her Majesty instructed me to present a few gifts as evidence of her graciousness
come here .
this pipe is for you , Prince August .
these sables are to keep your shoulders warm .
these gloves are to keep your hands warm .
this robe is to keep your feet warm .
these hot-water bottles ... to keep Mother warm .
is it then still so cold in Russia , Your Excellency ?
indeed , Your Highness , the rivers are still frozen ... and will be until some time after we &apos;ve arrived .
her Majesty also asked me to give you this token of her esteem .
convey to her my profoundest thanks .
isn &apos;t Her Majesty beautiful !
how long will the journey take ?
if weather permits , we should reach Moscow in seven weeks ... where Her Majesty is impatiently awaiting us .
- And when does Your Excellency require the journey be begun ?
- The day after tomorrow ... unless it is the desire of this charming young lady ... to leave at once to meet her anxious bridegroom .
- Did you bring me a portrait of the grand duke ?
- I &apos;m sorry , I did not .
- Would you like him to be handsome ?
- Isn &apos;t he ? would you like him to be better looking than all men , tall and gracious ?
- Yes , I think I would .
- Well , he is all that and more .
he &apos;s the handsomest man in the Russian court , tall and formed like a Greek god ... a model in fashion and deportment which all of us strive to follow .
- Are you eager to see him ?
- Yes .
his eyes are like the blue sky ... his hair the colour of ebony .
he is stronger than a team of oxen ... and sleepless because of his desire to receive you in his arms .
and he can also read and write .
so can my daughter .
she can cook and sew and make her own bed if she has to .
- Can &apos;t you , Sophia ?
- But I don &apos;t like to make my own bed , Mother .
- Don &apos;t speak unless you &apos;re questioned .
- You did question me , Mother .
say goodnight , and go back to your room and go to sleep .
Goodnight , Father .
Goodnight , Sophia .
Goodnight , Your Excellency .
Goodnight , my little princess .
- Goodnight , Mother .
- Goodnight .
- Goodnight , Auntie .
- Goodnight .
- Goodnight .
- Goodnight .
- Goodnight .
- Goodnight .
- Goodnight .
- Goodnight .
this is unexpected .
your daughter is extremely charming ... and will be by far the most beautiful woman at Her Majesty &apos;s court .
I &apos;d be grateful if you were not to turn her head .
she &apos;s been brought up carefully , is unspoilt ... and I &apos;ve taught her not to flirt .
you &apos;re going on a far journey , and I may never see you again .
remember what I &apos;ve taught you .
always to be honest and truthful , to be a faithful wife and a loyal subject of your new country .
be kind to those who are in your service ... and obedient to your husband and superiors ... and strive at all times to be worthy of your glorious destiny .
another day like this , and I &apos;ll fall apart .
when I return , I &apos;ll complain to the king about the state of his roads .
the roads are bad , aren &apos;t they ?
when we reach the border , there will be snow and we shall change to sleds .
your rooms are ready , Your Royal Highness .
can I show them to you ?
Yes , you may .
I &apos;m prepared for the worst .
journey proving too much for you too ?
it could go on forever ... if Mother didn &apos;t mind .
be careful with that knife .
you &apos;ll cut your beautiful hand .
your hand is beautiful , isn &apos;t it ?
- Why did you do that ?
- Because I &apos;ve fallen in love with you .
now you may punish me for my effrontery .
I deserve punishment far more than you do .
we must never do this again .
it &apos;s disloyal to my future husband .
disloyal ?
it &apos;s treason , and I must be careful in the future ... but you must help me by not exciting me with your beautiful eyes .
I told you not to look at me .
what are you two doing ?
don &apos;t answer me . I don &apos;t want to know .
Sophia , you ought to be ashamed of yourself .
you will instantly follow me to our rooms .
Incidentally , our rooms are beneath all contempt , Your Excellency .
the stables are probably better than the quarters assigned to us .
I &apos;m sorry , Your Highness .
if you prefer the stables ...
I can arrange to have the horses quartered in your bedroom .
Barbarian !
you &apos;re going to sleep in my room tonight .
it is cold .
at least you have something to warm you when you get to Moscow ,
that is , if your husband isn &apos;t completely made of ice .
a basket of fruit with Her Majesty &apos;s compliments ... and these flowers from the grand duke ... who instructed me to ride day and night for a week to be here in time .
welcome home , Your Excellency .
we &apos;ve missed you .
so , this is Little Sophie , Sophia Frederica .
hardly a name for a future empress .
- You don &apos;t like your name , do you ?
- I do , Your Majesty .
you will be called Catherine Alekseyevna , a good Russian name .
we &apos;ve arranged a special ceremony to receive you into our church .
- Haven &apos;t we , Simeon ?
- Yes , little mother , we &apos;ve arranged a ceremony .
come here .
so , this is the mother .
you &apos;ve raised a pretty child .
your Majesty , I &apos;ve come to lay at your feet feelings of the deepest gratitude ... for the benefactions which your bounty .
has heaped upon my house ... and of which many instances are given me at every step I take into your realms .
&#91; empress &#93; Tush , tush !
a pretty speech .
what I have done is nothing in comparison with what I shall do .
- My own blood is no more dear to me than yours - Is that the grand duke ?
this is the order of St Catherine .
may you both wear it in good health .
be careful it doesn &apos;t scratch you .
pin this on Catherine .
what do you think of Catherine ?
I can only admire your judgement , Your Majesty .
that &apos;s the chancellor .
steals more money in a week than I collect in taxes in a year .
doctor , come here .
what do you think of my taste in women ?
looks healthy , doesn &apos;t she ?
just what we need to breed sons for Russia .
with your permission , Your Highness .
- How was the journey ?
comfortable ?
- Yes , Your Majesty .
are you happy to be here ?
Yes , Your Majesty .
- Are you going to love your new country ?
- Yes , Your Majesty .
- Do you promise to be a loyal subject ?
- Yes , Your Majesty .
don &apos;t make too many new friends , and no intrigue and gossip . I have my hands full now .
perfect , Your Majesty .
she will give us no trouble .
your Highness .
someday I &apos;ll have every doctor thrown out of the country .
Catherine , before you go to your rooms , is there any wish I can grant you ?
I would like to see the grand duke .
his Imperial Highness , Grand Duke Peter .
that &apos;s a fine way to receive your bride !
I suppose you had more important things to do .
I told you to be on time .
go on , kiss each other .
remember , Catherine , the first child must be a boy .
that &apos;s why we had you brought here , to provide Russia with an heir to the throne .
a fine , bouncing , healthy heir .
you understand me , Catherine ?
&#91; Alexei &#93; These are your ladies-in-waiting
they represent illustrious houses of our most important domains .
step forward , Natacha .
she is the daughter of Prince Dolgoruki .
Natacha , come here .
this is your mistress of the wardrobe .
she has charge of the beds and laces .
I must show her my new invention .
I &apos;m in a hurry .
I must witness an execution .
&#91; Alexei &#93; I suggest that you wait in the next room .
perhaps I shouldn &apos;t have lied to you .
forgive me , won &apos;t you ?
his Imperial Highness sent me for his soldiers .
I hope I haven &apos;t disturbed you .
that &apos;s Countess Vorontsov .
she &apos;s always picking up the grand duke &apos;s soldiers ... which I &apos;m beginning to suspect he leaves intentionally .
don &apos;t bother .
don &apos;t bother .
go on with your work .
doesn &apos;t Sophia , I mean , Catherine , look beautiful ?
I always forget the new name .
just see what &apos;s being done to her hair !
that &apos;s exactly what I &apos;m looking at .
how &apos;s she going to wear the headdress ?
where is the headdress ?
- Where is the headdress ?
- Where &apos;s the headdress ?
we must make you very beautiful , Catherine , very , very beautiful ... so that my nephew will fall in love with you .
I expect you two to behave like love birds so Russia will have an heir to the throne .
remember , I want a boy , not a girl .
nothing less than a boy will do .
we don &apos;t want any more women on the throne .
but Your Majesty , what would we have done if you had been born a boy ?
I would have had less trouble in Russia if I &apos;d been born a man instead of woman .
we women are too much creatures of the heart , aren &apos;t we , Catherine ?
Yes , Your Majesty .
&quot; grant them of the fruit of their bodies fair children ...
&quot; concord of soul and body .
&quot; Exalt them like the cedars of Lebanon .
&quot; like a luxuriant vine , give them seed in number like full ears of grain ...
&quot; that they may abound in every work that is good and acceptable unto Thee ,
&quot; and let them behold their children &apos;s children like a newly planted olive orchard ...
&quot; round about their table that obtaining favour in Thy sight ... they may shine like the stars of heaven . &quot;
blessed be this bed .
your Imperial Majesty ... before the bridal pair retire , I wish to propose a toast ... to Her Imperial Highness , the grand duchess Catherine .
may our new bride from far away be forever happy ... and learn to know the love we have in our Russian hearts for her ... and the hope this vast , imperishable empire has ... for an heir to the throne .
you have made me very happy today , Catherine ... and I hope you will continue to make me happy .
now , I &apos;m going to bed .
I &apos;m very tired .
and I know that most of you ... are-
are also very tired .
may I enquire how Her Imperial Highness deigns to feel this morning ?
&#91; Panting &#93; Her Highness feels as well as can be expected ... after her romantic marriage .
and how is His Excellency ?
his Excellency is distressed because you &apos;ve been avoiding him for an eternity .
- I haven &apos;t been avoiding you . - You have .
I &apos;ve tried again and again to see you alone ...
- and you &apos;ve made it impossible .
- If you must know ...
I haven &apos;t had enough time to recover from the shock ... of finding my husband a trife different than you described him .
I had a duty to my country and a loyalty to my sovereign .
had I described the grand duke correctly ... you might not have come here .
I would have obeyed my mother even if you had told the truth .
how could I have known of such a degree of filial respect ?
anyway , I would have taken no chances , because from the moment I saw you ...
- I wanted you to come to Russia .
- Please , be careful .
- My husband will be told .
- Your husband doesn &apos;t mean a thing to you .
he does .
I &apos;ll always be faithful to him .
those ideas are old-fashioned .
this is the eighteenth century .
but I &apos;m not a Russian .
I &apos;m going now .
I told you I wanted to see you alone .
I won &apos;t wait any longer .
I &apos;ll be at the stables tomorrow when you go for your ride .
maybe I won &apos;t care to ride any more .
- I &apos;ll be there , and you &apos;d better be there too .
- I will not !
furthermore , I &apos;m going to tell my mother all about you .
one moment more , Your Imperial Highness
on the reverse side of this miniature is a diamond .
don &apos;t lose the diamond .
what are you doing here sneaking around like a ghost ?
- I hate my wife .
- You hate your wife ?
you &apos;ve only been married for a week .
why ?
you &apos;ll make a fine emperor someday , you idiot !
you can &apos;t force a woman to be sweet to you .
she &apos;s only a child !
be patient with her .
you know our people are waiting for you to raise a family .
- They don &apos;t care whether you like her .
- I don &apos;t want her .
I picked her for your wife , and your wife she will remain as long as I live .
get that into your skull .
I don &apos;t want to hear anymore about it .
do you understand me ?
her Majesty is waiting for you in the council chamber .
- War with Finland ?
- Yes , Your Excellency .
- How is Her Majesty ?
- The last few days she &apos;s turned sour ... like milk that &apos;s been standing too long .
your Highness is so happy this morning .
- You can &apos;t be going to see your husband .
- Dear me , my husband !
I &apos;d forgotten I have a husband .
no , I &apos;m not going to see my husband .
if Your Highness were not so new to our court , I &apos;d suspect you were going to see your lover .
lover ?
and what may a lover be ?
a lover &apos;s a man , not a husband , who loves you with all his heart and whom you love in return .
but , Marie , that &apos;s wicked .
don &apos;t tell me that you have a lover !
I wish I had Here , everyone has a lover , everyone but me .
Oh , Marie , not everyone .
her Exalted Majesty can &apos;t possibly have a lover .
what about the young man who &apos;s always with her ?
why do you suppose she leans on him so heavily ?
because she &apos;s weak in the knees ?
Oh , how shocking ! if anyone should hear us ! go on , get my dress .
your highness won &apos;t tell anyone .
the empress is a devil when she &apos;s angry .
of course I won &apos;t tell anyone , nor do I believe such nonsense .
neither have I a lover . I &apos;m happy because I &apos;m going to see my mother .
- Your mother ?
I thought you knew . - Knew what ?
your mother left for Germany .
her carriage set out at midnight .
- You must be joking . - I &apos;m not joking .
her Majesty ordered her to return immediately .
but she didn &apos;t say goodbye .
that &apos;s not possible .
her Majesty &apos;s in council . no one &apos;s allowed to enter .
no order in this palace is intended for me .
why did you send my mother away ?
what wrong had she done ?
I don &apos;t remember sending for you .
I want to know why you sent my mother away .
&#91; empress &#93; You presume to question me ?
who do you think you are ... bursting into a conference as though the palace were on fire ?
you want to know why I sent your mother away .
well , I &apos;ll tell you why .
I sent your mother away because she didn &apos;t bring you up properly .
I was told you were an obedient , respectful child .
you &apos;re nothing of the sort !
why do you think I had you brought from Germany ?
to give you these pearls ?
or to make you a grand duchess of the Holy Russian Empire ?
I had you brought here to be an obedient wife ... and to supply my country with a much-needed heir to the throne .
take Her Imperial Highness , the grand duchess ... and turn her over to my mistress of the robes ... with instructions that from this minute on she &apos;s to be attached to my personal staff ... where I can keep her under my eye , where I can educate her and teach her ... what it means to be a Russian wife and how to accept the embraces of a husband ... like a Russian wife !
now , get out , both of you .
I have a war on my hands
looking for someone ?
Oh , you frightened me .
&#91; whispering &#93; I &apos;ve only a minute .
I ran away .
I came down to tell you not to wait .
I must go now .
is that all you came to tell me ?
what else is there to tell ?
if you come closer , I &apos;ll scream .
it will be easier for you to scream without a straw in your mouth .
get up !
get up !
why are there six places ?
what &apos;s the occasion ?
you asked me to arrange a dinner for the French and Austrian ambassadors and their wives .
tell them to come for breakfast .
I never did like these diplomatic functions .
- They lead to nothing .
- I quite agree , Your Majesty .
&#91; chair Scratching Floor &#93; Don &apos;t any of you think I &apos;m going to eat with a lot of dried-up mummies every night .
Boris , sit down there .
Alexander , sit over there .
you , sit there .
Michael !
- Your Majesty .
- Catherine .
take his toys .
Michael , sit there .
- Your Majesty .
- Oh , go on .
sit down .
now , the rest of you get out .
get out !
get out !
- The pig , Your Majesty .
- Put it down and don &apos;t make so much fuss about it .
the way you handle that pig , you &apos;d think it was the only one in Russia .
- The wine , Your Majesty .
- Fill the glasses and get out .
what are you pouting for ?
you &apos;re not jealous of Paul , are you ?
he isn &apos;t jealous of you .
you look exhausted , Paul .
what &apos;s the matter ?
I &apos;m tired .
my wife gave birth to a child yesterday .
- Boy or girl ?
- A boy beloved empress
what the wife of a guard can do should certainly be easy for a grand duchess
remind me to give you a purse of gold tomorrow Those of you who have boys ... raise your hands Exactly what I thought !
a few more like you , and Russia need never worry about her enemies .
what &apos;s this , Alexei ?
sending notes to the grand duchess ?
do you want me to send you into exile ?
or shall I tell the grand duchess that you &apos;re a notorious heartbreaker ... and have broken every woman &apos;s heart in this court , including mine ?
you &apos;re very flattering , Imperial Majesty , but the note contains nothing of importance .
then suppose you read it .
&quot; we are all very much disturbed over your conduct ... and wish you would change your behaviour so that Her Majesty might forgive you . &quot;
who else can read here ?
you read it , Catherine .
I know you can read ... because my reports say you foolishly spend your time in bed reading books !
&quot; we are all very much upset at , uh , uh-
&quot; at- and hope ...
you will behave better ... so that you may be forgiven by the empress . &quot;
send for the chancellor !
- Your Imperial Majesty ?
- Read this for me .
&quot; you must help me to see you alone again .
&quot; you are being watched so closely that all my efforts to meet you ... for a few precious seconds are in vain . &quot;
so , you &apos;re up to your old tricks again !
right under my nose too .
well , forget about her .
she &apos;s reserved for my nephew and being taught how to earn his love first ... before wasting her favours on others .
go back to your dinner .
it &apos;s the first time you &apos;ve been of use to me in a year .
as for you , look after my friends and see that they &apos;re fed well .
did you hear what I said ?
&#91; empress &#93; Sit down , you fools , or I &apos;ll send you to Siberia .
she maybe a grand duchess to the rest of the world ... but in here she &apos;s being taught how to be a Russian wife !
Catherine , where are you ?
take off my boots !
go outside and send the others away .
everybody !
I want to be alone tonight .
her Majesty wishes to be alone tonight .
you wouldn &apos;t think that once I had skin like velvet .
empress , bah !
I haven &apos;t even the power to iron out a single wrinkle .
what are you looking at ?
that must be Peter .
go see if it is , and tell him to come here at once .
your Imperial Highness , Her Majesty wishes to see you at once .
what the devil do you mean poking holes in my bedroom ?
I wanted to watch my wife .
watching your wife won &apos;t give you an heir to the throne .
the next time I catch you providing my rooms with needless ventilation ...
I &apos;ll have you fogged .
I &apos;ll catch my death of a draught someday !
go back to your rooms and wait for your wife .
this is your fault .
I had hoped by bringing you to Russia to make a man of that half-wit !
sorry to intrude , Your Majesty .
I think the grand duke dropped one of his soldiers in here .
thank you .
Goodnight .
wait a minute .
come here .
how long have you been at this court picking up soldiers ?
two years and a half , Your Majesty .
I fail to recall your exact duties here , Countess Elizabeth .
I &apos;m in charge of entertainment for His Imperial Highness , the grand duke .
exactly how far is it to your home , Lizzie ?
my ancestral home is in the province of Astrakhan ... about two weeks &apos; journey from Moscow .
not as far as I had hoped .
his Imperial Highness has been entertained long enough .
do you understand me ?
I don &apos;t want to see you around again .
get out .
she won &apos;t snoop around here any more .
I should have thrown her out before I had you brought here .
come here , Catherine .
sit down .
haven &apos;t you given me trouble enough ?
are you going to behave like an obedient wife ... or must I continue to treat you like a stubborn child ?
I don &apos;t care what you do with me .
you might change your mind about that .
you &apos;re in love with His Excellency , Count Alexei , aren &apos;t you ?
no , Your Majesty , I &apos;m not .
I &apos;m not .
it &apos;s a good thing you &apos;re not .
I wouldn &apos;t advise you to become my rival .
rival ?
what does Your Majesty mean ?
you will find out soon .
in the meantime , you can blow out the candles .
&#91; empress &#93; Before you retire ... you can be of one more service .
behind my mirror , a concealed passage will lead you down ... a flight of stairs to another door .
behind that door you will find someone waiting to come up .
I don &apos;t want him to see you , so be careful .
- Goodnight , Your Majesty .
- Goodnight , Catherine .
and you don &apos;t need to report for duty until late tomorrow .
Halt !
who goes there ?
- Nobody .
- Just a minute , my little hen .
that &apos;s not the password .
you &apos;d better think up another one .
come to the guardhouse , and we &apos;ll find out who you are .
you &apos;re entirely too good-looking to be running around like this .
what are you hiding back there ?
take your hands off me , you insolent fool !
I &apos;m Catherine , grand duchess of Russia .
don &apos;t take advantage of me .
this is my first night on duty .
the grand duchess isn &apos;t permitted out at night .
tell me who you are .
I told you who I am .
Oh , come now .
stop joking .
if you &apos;re the grand duchess , then I &apos;m the grand duke .
I wish you were !
if I were the grand duke and you were the grand duchess ...
I wouldn &apos;t let you prowl through the night like this ... like a pretty little kitten .
suppose I didn &apos;t want to tell you who I really am . what would happen ?
on a night like this , anything might happen ... if I &apos;m fortunate .
well , Lieutenant , you are fortunate ... very ... fortunate .
Twenty !
Twenty-one .
it &apos;s a boy !
have you noticed , Your Majesty ... how the imperial duckling resembles his father ?
hush , hush , enough of this .
now , you keep an eye on him .
I don &apos;t want anyone near him unless I know about it , not even his mother .
I had enough trouble getting him .
if he catches cold or sniff es just once ...
I &apos;ll have you hung by the ears !
if he coughs , I &apos;ll have you cut in half !
and if anyone touches him , I &apos;ll have you shot !
your Majesty , I beg of you not to become excited .
you &apos;ve been ill for weeks .
this turmoil will weaken you .
don &apos;t any of you think I &apos;ll give you the pleasure of seeing me die !
I &apos;ll outlive all of you , you sinister buzzards . all of you !
- We &apos;ve been glad with rejoicing .
- Your Imperial Highness !
I suppose you , too , want to congratulate me ... as the father of the heir to the throne of Russia .
that was my intention , Your Imperial Highness .
and I bring you the felicitations of my nation ... and my own personal congratulations on so glorious an event .
tell me about it some other time .
I want to be alone , do you hear ?
get out , all of you !
I &apos;m crammed up to my neck with congratulations ! get out !
and if you must congratulate someone , congratulate my wife !
&#91; whispering &#93; May I speak with Her Highness ?
the empress joins her people in congratulating Your Highness ... on the birth of a male heir to the throne of Russia .
we all hope you will recover quickly ... so you may wear this jewel ... which Her Majesty is pleased to present to you as a sign ... of her most extraordinary joy and satisfaction .
sit down , ladies . sit down .
your Excellency , what can I do for you ?
please ask Her Highness once more ...
- if she will grant me an audience ?
- I &apos;m sorry , Your Excellency ... we have orders from Her Highness not even to mention your name to her .
then perhaps you will convey to Her Highness ... that I &apos;ve been waiting for some time now to congratulate her ... on the great historic event of providing our country with a much-needed heir to the throne .
I &apos;m certain that history was far from her mind at the time , Your Excellency .
her Majesty is very ill , and her days are numbered .
soon she will be no more , poor soul ... and another maniac will become our emperor .
it will be a bad day for Russia , and for me if I live that long .
why are you telling this to me ?
you know that the grand duke isn &apos;t exactly pleased with the present state of affairs .
state of affairs ?
what affairs ?
I haven &apos;t had an affair for some time .
I know that the grand duke plans to remove you from court ... or worse , as soon as he is in power .
you need have no fear for me .
now that I &apos;ve learned how Russia expects me to behave ...
I like it here .
and I intend to stay ... grand duke or no grand duke !
we all hope you will stay ... and I for one , at the risk of my neck , would like to help you .
how could you be of help ?
I control enough of the political machine to carry some weight in a crisis .
I have no wish to share in any petty conspiracy .
should it become unavoidable , I think I have weapons ... that are far more powerful than any political machine .
I &apos;m afraid you don &apos;t know Russians , my child .
that &apos;s possible , father , But I &apos;m taking lessons as fast as I can .
right here , gentlemen .
what a lovely target .
you &apos;re looking quite well , Catherine ... since you provided me with an unexpected addition to the family .
thank you , Peter . it &apos;s nice to see you again .
come to think of it , I &apos;d like you to meet someone ... who &apos;s come for an extended visit .
what are you doing here ? back to the barracks !
get out !
come along , Catherine .
what do you think of this decapitation ?
it would be more amusing if it were real .
where &apos;s your visitor ?
Oh , it &apos;s Lizzie .
is she in charge of your entertainment again ? what will Her Majesty say ?
her Majesty doesn &apos;t know anything about it ... and I wouldn &apos;t advise you to tell her .
I wouldn &apos;t dream of telling the empress .
she has her own system of spies .
not for the world would I interfere with your pleasures ... as long as you don &apos;t interfere with mine .
how is Astrakhan , Lizzie ? or was it Afghanistan ?
if you &apos;re wise , you &apos;ll find out for yourself before it &apos;s too late !
there are comfortable convents along the way .
all you have to do to gain admission ... is shave your head It &apos;s good for the scalp , anyway !
entirely too many men love my hair ... and I have no intention of changing my residence .
- Anyway , this country will soon need a new empress .
- You mayas well know ..
Peter &apos;s going to marry me when the old bat dies ... and as soon as he gets rid of his present wife !
there you are , you old crow .
dead as a doornail at last .
what have you got to say about it ?
open your mouth if you can .
in another week , it &apos;ll be full of ice .
in another month , not a soul will mourn for you .
in another year , you &apos;ll be forgotten .
where is all your power ?
it &apos;s mine now !
do you hear me ?
take it away from me if you can !
it &apos;s my turn now !
&#91; yelling &#93;
♪ ♪ &#91; Drum Roll &#93;
- Who is this officer ? - Orloff , Your Majesty ...
Captain in charge of the barracks .
your Majesty , your visit here is the greatest honour in my life .
I &apos;ve heard a good deal about you , Captain ... from the ladies .
I didn &apos;t expect to see you here , Your Excellency .
why not , Your Majesty ?
this is my pet regiment .
you look ravishing .
now , there &apos;s another good-looking soldier .
come here , Lieutenant .
what &apos;s your name ?
Dmitri , Your Majesty .
and your duties , Dmitri ?
in charge of the night watch , Your Majesty .
it must be cold at night ...
sometimes .
sometimes , Your Majesty .
anyway , I &apos;m certain you &apos;re very efficient , Lieutenant . is he , Captain ?
tell me something about him .
he &apos;s very efficient , Your Majesty .
he joined our regiment from the Swedish front ... where he fought bravely for about two years .
he &apos;s also distinguished himself by exemplary bravery on the Turkish border .
this should have been brought to our attention .
I can &apos;t understand why such a brave man hasn &apos;t been decorated .
his Excellency doesn &apos;t mind .
not if Her Majesty will tell me why she continues to avoid me .
her Majesty will tell you tonight ...
if you will call on her .
with pleasure , Your Majesty .
for bravery in action .
see that you do justice to it in future emergencies .
and now , Captain , tell me something about yourself .
your Majesty , I &apos;m distressed at my neglect at not having rewarded Lieut . Dmitri before .
with your permission , Your Majesty .
rich too , huh ?
her Majesty will see you now , Your Excellency .
at last , Your Majesty , I &apos;ve achieved ... the enviable privilege of entering these rooms .
I seem to have a faint recollection that you had that privilege before .
not since the days of Her Late Majesty ... whom I often visited in the capacity of a trusted advisor .
tell the others I &apos;ve retired .
send them away , and come back in here .
her Majesty wishes to be alone tonight .
you may retire .
tell me , Alexei , are you still fond of me ?
Yes , Your Majesty , I love you .
but I &apos;m completely bewildered by your attitude towards me .
however , I &apos;ve become accustomed to regard you ... as one of those extraordinary women ... who create their own laws and logic .
and now I &apos;m concerned only with your safety .
is it my safety that concerns you ... or the safety of an empress ?
I would give my life if the woman I adore were not so far removed from me in station .
the woman you adore is quite close to you , isn &apos;t she ?
Catherine , I love you , worship you .
I asked you here tonight because I want you to do something for me .
I can trust you , can &apos;t I ?
we &apos;ll always be friends , won &apos;t we ?
Yes , Your Majesty .
what is it you require ?
blow out the candles .
behind the mirror , as you know , there &apos;s a fight of stairs .
down below , someone is waiting to come up .
will His Excellency be kind enough to open the door for him carefully ... so that he can sneak in ?
her Majesty is waiting for you , Captain . Yes , sir .
thank you , sir .
will you deliver a message for me , Captain ?
I would be very glad to , sir .
tell Her Majesty that I quite understand now . no , never mind .
don &apos;t tell her anything .
- She &apos;ll know . - Yes , sir .
something for the poor , Your Majesty ?
for the poor , Captain ?
Excellency ?
quite a haul tonight , father .
chancellor ?
Elizabeth ?
your Imperial Majesty , something for the poor ?
that was for me .
now what have you got for the poor ?
there are no poor in Russia ! get out !
I &apos;ve had enough of this sanctimonious talk .
let us drink .
why doesn &apos;t he take up his collections in church ?
to the most charming woman in my empire ... my friend , the countess Elizabeth .
go ask Her Majesty , my wife , why she doesn &apos;t join our toast .
his Majesty , the emperor of Russia , wishes me to ask ... why Her Majesty refuses to join the toast .
tell His Majesty that my thirst is not as great as his tonight .
her Majesty wishes me to convey that her thirst is not as great as his tonight .
go tell my wife she &apos;s a fool .
his Majesty wishes me to inform Her Majesty ... that she is a fool .
what is your rank , Orloff ?
Captain , Your Majesty .
well , you &apos;re nothing now .
now get out , both of you , and stay out !
sit down !
my wife is not to leave the palace .
she &apos;s under arrest until further orders .
am I the emperor of Russia , or am I not ?
we &apos;ll issue a proclamation that she died ... and ask the people to pray for her .
&#91; clock Chiming &#93;
hurry , Your Majesty .
everything is ready .
what are you doing here ?
Halt !
exit Peter III .
enter Catherine II .
we , soldiers in the service of the Holy Russian Empire ... do hereby solemnly swear to acknowledge ... and to defend with our lives , the authority of Catherine our empress ... and to destroy her enemies !
&#91; soldiers &#93; Hooray !
Hooray !
Hooray !
your Majesty , we &apos;re sorry to trouble you ... but Her Majesty isn &apos;t in here , is she ?
she &apos;s no longer in her rooms .
you infernal blockhead !
this is the last place in the world she would come to .
double the guard !
surround the palace !
find her and bring her here to me !
God grant you victory , Catherine .
all Russia is waiting for the sound of our bell .
what are those bells ringing ?
- What are those bells ringing ?
- I don &apos;t know , Peter .
how dare you address me like that ! who are you ?
my name is Orloff , and I &apos;m on duty as guard .
I &apos;ll have your head for this insolence !
you &apos;re addressing the emperor !
there is no emperor .
there is only an empress .
stall , please .
ladies and gentlemen ... with your kind attention and permission ...
I have the honor of presenting to you ... one of the most remarkable men in the world .
- How remarkable ?
- He &apos;s sweating .
can you be surprised at that , gentlemen ?
every day he commits to memory 50 new facts ... and remembers every one of them .
facts from history , from geography , from newspapers ... from scientific books , millions and millions of them .
think of the strain involved by his prodigious feat .
his feet ain &apos;t half as big as yours , cully .
I &apos;m referring to his feats of memory .
test him , please .
ladies and gentlemen , ask him your questions ... and he will answer you , fully and freely .
Mr. Memory .
I also add , ladies and gentlemen , before retiring ... that Mr. Memory has left his brain to the British Museum .
Hurray !

I haven &apos;t decorated . wait till I find the switch .

Mr. Hannay , would you be kind and turn that mirror to the wall ?
you &apos;d be happier if there were curtains over those windows .
- Yes .
- I &apos;m sorry .
there &apos;s the telephone . just a minute .
- Don &apos;t answer the telephone .
- Why not ?
because I think it &apos;s for me . please don &apos;t answer .
just as you say .
- Won &apos;t you sit down ?
- Would you kick that footstool to me ?
you needed that .
I did . thank you .
- I owe you an explanation .
- Don &apos;t bother about me .
- I &apos;m nobody .
- We cannot talk here .

- Okay ? - Mm-hmm .
- Cigarette ?
- No , thank you .

Hello . Nervy ? upset by those shots tonight ?
I fired those shots .
- You what ?
- Yes , to create a diversion .
I had to get away from that theater quickly .
there were two men there who wanted to kill me .
you should be more careful in choosing your gentlemen friends .
- You don &apos;t understand .
- You don &apos;t make it easy for me .
beautiful , mysterious woman pursued by gunmen .
sounds like a spy story .
that &apos;s exactly what it is .
- Only I prefer the word agent better .
- &quot; Agent &quot; ?
- For what country ?
- Any country that pays me .
- What is your country ?
- I have no country .
born in a balloon ? we &apos;ll let that go .
I suppose you &apos;ve come here ... to dig up some great big state secret .
I am here to save a secret from being divulged .
a very important secret for this country .
not because I love England , but because it will pay me better .
- Thank you .
- The very brilliant agent ... of a certain foreign power ... is on the point of obtaining a secret vital to your air defense .
I tracked two of his men to that music hall .
unfortunately , they recognized me .
- That &apos;s why they &apos;re after me now .
- That was too bad .
you ever heard of a thing called &quot; persecution mania &quot; ?
- You don &apos;t believe me ?
- Frankly , I don &apos;t .
go and look down into the street then .
you win .
- Are they there ?
- Yes .
I &apos;d hoped I &apos;d shaken them off .
I &apos;m going to tell you something which is not very healthy to know .
but now that they have followed me here ... you are in it as much as I am .
how do you mean ?
- Have you ever heard of the 39 Steps ? - No .
what &apos;s that , a pub ?
never mind .
but what you were laughing at is true .
these men will stop at nothing .
I &apos;m the only person who can stop them .
if they are not stopped , it &apos;s only a matter of days , perhaps hours ...
- before the secret is out .
- Why don &apos;t you phone the police ?
because they wouldn &apos;t believe me any more than you did .
if they did , how long do you think it would take to get them going ?
these men act quickly .
you don &apos;t know how clever their chief is .
- Clever and ruthless .
- Who is he ? what &apos;s his name ?
he has a dozen names , and he can look like a hundred people .
but one thing he cannot disguise : this .
part of his little finger is missing .
if ever you should meet a man with no top joint there ...
- be very careful , my friend .
- Thanks . I &apos;ll make a note of it .
Meanwhile , what are you going to do ?
first , I &apos;ll eat my haddock ... then , if you are not going to turn me out onto the street ...
- have a good night &apos;s rest .
- You &apos;re welcome to my bed .
I &apos;ll get a shakedown on the couch .
anything else I can get you ?
- A map of Scotland .
- Why Scotland ?
there &apos;s a man in Scotland whom I must visit next if anything is to be done .
are the 39 Steps in Scotland , by any chance ?
perhaps I &apos;ll tell you tomorrow .
clear out , Hannay . they &apos;ll get you next .
what you were laughing at just now is true .
these men will stop at nothing .
there &apos;s a man in Scotland ... whom I must visit next if anything is to be done .
it is only a matter of days , perhaps hours ... before the secret is out of the country .
the police will not believe me any more than you did .
I tell you , these men act quickly .
quickly . quickly .
good morning , sir . you &apos;re up bright and early this morning .
could you use a pound note , brother ?
- What &apos;s the catch ?
- I want to borrow your cap and coat .
- What &apos;s all this ? what &apos;s the big idea ?
- I want to make a getaway .
- To a bunk ?
- Yes .
- What have you been up to ?
- I &apos;ll have to trust you .
there &apos;s been a murder up on the first floor .
- By you ?
- No , by those two men out there .
I see .
I suppose they &apos;re waiting there for a copper to come and arrest them .
it &apos;s quite true . they &apos;re spies , foreigners .
they &apos;ve murdered a woman in my flat , and now they &apos;re waiting for me .
come off it . funny jokes at 5 : 00 in the morning .
all right . I &apos;ll tell you the truth .
- Are you married ?
- Yes , but don &apos;t rub it in .
- What &apos;s the idea now ?
- I &apos;m not . I &apos;m a bachelor .
a married woman lives on the first floor .
- Does she ?
- Yes . I &apos;ve just been paying her a call .
- Now I want to go home .
- What &apos;s preventing you ?
one of those men is her brother , the other &apos;s her husband .
why didn &apos;t you tell me before ? I only wanted to be told .
trying to keep me with tales about murders and foreigners .
here , put this on . put on my hat . there you are .
- Take the pound .
- No , sir , you &apos;re welcome to it .
you &apos;d do the same for me one day .
lead the pony around the corner .
- So long , old sport .
- Good-bye . thank you .
Oy ! the empties !
papers , magazines , chocolates , cigarettes .
there he is .
for one thing , they &apos;re much prettier than they were 20 years ago .
- More free . free and easy .
- You &apos;re right there .
I could never understand how people used to put up with the old-fashioned sort .
all bones and no bend .
- The old-fashioned did last longer .
- I don &apos;t know .
mine last about a year . here , I &apos;ll show you .
big demand for these now .
- The old-fashioned sort .
- Brrr ! my wife .
now look at these .
- Our new Streamline Model Number 1 .
- Anything go with it ?
I should say so . this .
put a pretty girl inside those , and she needn &apos;t be ashamed of herself .
- Bring it back to me when it &apos;s filled .
- I will . what &apos;s this ? Edinburgh , Waverley .
we &apos;re getting on . - Pardon us for talking business , sir .
- Certainly .
- Good day .
- Good day , sir .
good day .
- Good day .
- Broad-minded old geezer .
bet he &apos;s very good at charades .
- I wonder what won the 2 : 00 at Windsor .
- I don &apos;t know . let &apos;s get a paper .
- Paper .
- Say , son , speak the English ?
dispatch .
- Hello .
- What won it ?
there &apos;s been another woman murdered in a West End flat .
- What ?
- &quot; Woman murdered in West End flat . &quot;
these sex dramas don &apos;t appeal to me . what won ?
- Bachelor Bud . seven to four odds .
- Good . not so good .
Portland Mansions , Portland Place .
by the BBC .
that &apos;s a nice , quiet place to put someone to sleep .
- &quot; Good night , everybody . &quot;
- That &apos;s a good one .
what was she like ? one of the usual ?
&quot; a well-dressed woman of about 35 with a knife in her back .
the tenant , Richard Hannay , is missing . &quot;
you surprise me .
&quot; at 7 : 00 this morning , the charwoman , Elizabeth Briggs ... &quot;
if that isn &apos;t the blasted limit .
- What &apos;s the matter now ?
- Is there no honesty in this world ?
I ask you . &quot; the new Bodyline rubber panty corset .
on sale today . McCutcheon Brothers , Princess Street .
price : 17 and 9 .
Brassiere to match :
4 and 11 . &quot; you get that ?
the Bodyline . one and three cheaper than our Streamline .
no use going to Aberdeen now .
- Might I have a look at your paper ?
- Certainly .
- Thank you .
- Quite all right .
there &apos;s enough evidence there to hang any man .
what can I do for you , sir ?
can you tell me what station the train stops at next ?
do you think I &apos;m a railway porter ? go find out for yourself .
- I can tell a better one than that .
- You couldn &apos;t . that was very funny .
you liked it ?
have you heard the one about the young lady of Bulgar ?
- I can &apos;t remember them all .
- You must hear that .
- There was a young lady of Bulgar .
- Yes , we ...
- Taking tea , sir ?
- Yes . thank you .
darling , how lovely to see you !
young man having a free meal in there .
I was desperate . I &apos;m terribly sorry . I had to do it .
my name &apos;s Hannay . they &apos;re after me .
I swear I &apos;m innocent .
you &apos;ve got to help me .
I &apos;ve got to keep free for the next few days .
have you seen a man pass in the last few minutes ?
this is the man you want , I think .
- But when we passed just now ...
- He told me his name was Hannay .
- Is your name Hannay ?
- Are you coming into tea , sir ?
I &apos;ll be right along .
pull that cord !
stay away . go on , men . go down there .
get on with it .
heel ! why did you pull the communication cord ?
- To stop the train , you old fool .
- It &apos;s against all the regulations ...
- to stop the train on the bridge .
- A man jumped out .
he &apos;s a murderer . we &apos;ve got to take him .
- Which way did he go ?
- He must have jumped off here .
- I can &apos;t see him .
- Are you sure he jumped ?
- I cannot wait here any longer !
- There he is , getting on the train .
- No , that &apos;s a passenger .
- It &apos;s him , I tell you !
come on , then .
- Hannay escapes ! paper !
- Hannay escapes ! paper !
extra special ! Hannay escapes from police !
paper !
extra , extra ! paper !
correct . height : about five foot ten .
small moustache .
last seen wearing a dark suit ... but he may have obtained a change of clothing .
- Good day .
- And to you .
- What &apos;ll your business be ?
- I &apos;m a motor mechanic looking for a job .
- You &apos;ll find no work here .
- Are there no big houses around here ?
only Sir Andrews . he won &apos;t be wanting you .
he &apos;s had the same chauffeur for 40 years .
I didn &apos;t know there had been cars that long .
he was coachman besides when he was a boy .
I see . what &apos;s that ?
that &apos;s the manse . but the minister has no motorcar .
are there no newcomers ?
Aye . there &apos;s an Englishman , a professor .
- A professor ?
- He lives in Alt-na-Shellach .
- Where ?
- On the other side of the loch .
- Would that be near that village ?
- It would . thanks . I &apos;ll try there .
- You won &apos;t try tonight . it &apos;s 14 miles .
- Could I get a lift in that van ?
no , it &apos;s going the other way .
I guess you &apos;re right . could you put me up for the night ?
- Free ?
- No , I &apos;ll pay .
- All right . can you eat herring ?
- I could eat a half dozen right now .
- Can you sleep in a box bed ?
- I can try . - Two and six .
- Take it now . thank you .
go in with the gentleman .
he &apos;ll stay with us till tomorrow morning .
- Your daughter ?
- My wife .
- Will you now come in ?
- Thank you .
here &apos;s your bed .
I &apos;ll lift these things .
- Could you sleep there ?
- You try and stop me .
you &apos;ll be tired .
I &apos;ll say I am .
I &apos;m on the tramp , looking for a job .
won &apos;t you sit down while I go on with our supper ?
thank you .
- Have you been in these parts long ?
- No , I &apos;m from Glasgow .
- Did you ever see it ?
- No .
you should see Sauchiohall Street with all its fine shops ... and Argyll Street on a Saturday night ... with the trams and the lights ... and the cinema palaces and their crowds .
and it &apos;s Saturday night tonight .
you certainly don &apos;t get those things out here .
no .
you miss them ?
sometimes .
I &apos;ve never been to Glasgow , but I &apos;ve been to Edinburgh ... and Montreal and London .
I &apos;ll tell you all about London at supper .
- John wouldn &apos;t approve of that .
- Why not ?
he says it &apos;s best not to think of such places and the wickedness there .
why not listen now before he comes back ?
what do you want to know ?
is it true that all the ladies paint their toenails ?
some of them .
- Do London ladies look beautiful ?
- They do .
but they wouldn &apos;t if you were beside them .
- You ought not say that .
- What ought he not to say ?
I was saying I prefer living in town than the country .
God made the country .
- Is the supper ready , woman ?
- Aye . - Do you mind if I look at your paper ?
- I don &apos;t mind .
thank you .
- You did not tell me your name .
- Hammond .
well , Mr. Hammond , if you &apos;ll put down that paper , I &apos;ll say a blessing .
of course .
Sanctify these bounteous masses to us miserable sinners .
O Lord , make us truly thankful ... for them and for all Thy manifold blessings .
Continually turn our hearts ... from wickedness ... and from worldly things ... unto Thee .
amen .
I forgot to lock the barn .
there are cars coming .
it &apos;ll be the police . you best be going .
- Thank you . I was having a grand sleep .
- Don &apos;t let them catch you .
all right . I &apos;ll never forget you for doing this for me .
- Which way do I go ?
- I &apos;ll show you .
Aye . I might have known .
making love behind my back .
- Get out . you too .
- Just a minute ...
- Get out of my house before I ...
- Aye .
go . - And leave you like this ?
- It &apos;s your chance at liberty .
you don &apos;t understand .
you &apos;re all wrong about this . she was only trying to help me .
Aye , to bring shame and disgrace upon my house .
she was helping me to escape from the police .
- The police ?
- Yes , they &apos;re after me for murder .
- What ?
- They &apos;re here .
she was only warning me . I had to tell her last night .
don &apos;t let them in . say I &apos;m not here .
I &apos;ll make it worth your while .
- How much ?
- Five pounds .
have you got that much ? give it to me .
after they &apos;ve gone .
get back into bed . shut him in . hide him .
- Not there . I do not trust him .
- But he took the money .
he could not resist it . here .
have you seen a stranger about here ?
what kind of a stranger ?
I was right .
he &apos;s asking if there &apos;s a reward if you get catched .
he &apos;ll argue about it for a moment longer before he lets them in .
now &apos;s your time . your jacket &apos;s terrible light-colored .
I &apos;m a-feared they &apos;ll see you .
- You best take this one .
- Is this your husband &apos;s coat ?
his Sunday best one , but never mind . they must not see you .
- What will happen to you ?
- I &apos;ll say I couldn &apos;t stop you .
- He &apos;ll not ill treat you ?
- He &apos;ll pray at me , but no more .
- What &apos;s your name ?
- Margaret .
Good-bye , Margaret . I &apos;ll never forget you for this .
there he goes !
spread out in a line .
- Is the master in ?
- What name should I say , sir ?
he wouldn &apos;t know my name .
ask if he knows Miss Annabella Smith .
- Would you wait here while I inquire ?
- Yes . go on .
we &apos;d better make inquiries here .
somebody may have seen him through the windows .
- There &apos;s been a couple motorcars here .
- Aye . murderers do not make calls in motorcars .
- Good day , dear .
- The same to you .
have you seen any strangers this morning ?
there &apos;s a few callers upstairs now , but they &apos;re not strangers .
you haven &apos;t seen any suspicious-looking bodies outside the windows ...
- or calling at the house ?
- No , sir .
there hasn &apos;t been anybody near here for the last half hour .
- You &apos;re from Annabella Smith ?
- Yes .
we &apos;re just having a few drinks to celebrate my daughter &apos;s birthday .
give me five minutes , then we can talk .
- Of course .
- Come meet my wife . Louisa , my dear .
I &apos;ve another guest for you . this is Mr ...
- I forgot to ask your name .
- Hammond .
he &apos;s come to see me on business , all the way from London .
there &apos;s a police inspector at the door .
he wants to speak to you .
at the door ?
all right . I &apos;ll deal with it .
- Take him in , my dear .
- Come and meet my daughters .
- This is Patricia .
- How do you do ?
Mrs. Bailey . Mrs. Hutchins .
Hilary , my dear , this is Mr. Hammond .
- He just arrived from London .
- How do you do ?
forgive the orgy .
we &apos;ve been to church and the sermon lasted 45 minutes .
- This is Captain and Mrs. Ogilvey .
- How do you do ?
- Have a drink ?
- Thank you .
this is Derek Stewart .
and this is Sheriff Watson . you &apos;ve got to be polite to him .
he &apos;s our Sheriff Substitute . Scotch for a local beat .
he &apos;ll give you six months hard as soon as look at you .
it &apos;s all right . don &apos;t worry . I &apos;ve sent them away .
come and look at the view from this window .
we &apos;re rather proud of it .
- When will you catch that murderer ?
- What murderer ?
the man that stuck a carving knife into that woman last week .
- He &apos;s here in the district .
- How exciting . where ?
somewhere about . he &apos;s been on the moors .
sheriff Ames , why don &apos;t you catch him ?
you wouldn &apos;t like me to be stuck in the back with a carving knife .
it &apos;s no business of mine to catch him .
you catch him , and I &apos;ll convict him .
- Is there a reward ?
- It &apos;s nearly 1 : 00 . we must leave .
- The professor wants his lunch .
- There &apos;s no hurry , my dear .
still , if you must go ... Pat , ring for Captain Ogilvey &apos;s car .
Yes , sir .
are you coming out ?
come show us your new car .
- Come again another time .
- Good-bye . we &apos;d love to .
whenever you catch him , you &apos;ll find me at the Sherif Court every morning .
- Bring him along .
- Good-bye .
Louisa , if you &apos;ll excuse us ...
Mr. Hammond and I want to have a chat before lunch .
now , Mr. Hannay ...
I suppose it &apos;s safe to call you by your real name now .
what about our mutual friend , Annabella ?
- She &apos;s been murdered .
- &quot; Murdered &quot; ?
the Portland Mansions affair .
why our friends outside are looking for you .
- I didn &apos;t do it .
- Of course you didn &apos;t .
but why come all this way to Scotland to tell me ?
I believe she was coming to see you about some Air Ministry secret .
she was killed by a foreign agent who was interested too .
- Did she tell you what he looked like ?
- There wasn &apos;t time .
one thing : part of his little finger was missing .
- Which one ?
- This one , I think .
sure it wasn &apos;t this one ?
- Lunch is ready , dear .
- I &apos;m coming right away .
I &apos;ve been guilty of leading you down the garden path .
or should it be up ? I never can remember .
it seems to be the wrong garden , all right .
well .
- What are we going to do ?
- That &apos;s just the point .
what are we going to do about it ?
I live here as a respectable citizen .
you must realize that my whole existence would be jeopardized ... if it became known that I &apos;m not what I seem .
Mr. Hannay , why have you come here ?
why have you forced me into this difficult position ?
I can &apos;t lock you up in a room or anything like that .
there &apos;s my wife and daughters to think of .
I don &apos;t know what to think . really , I don &apos;t .
making it doubly important that I shouldn &apos;t let you go is ...
I &apos;m about to convey some very vital information out of the country .
Yes , I &apos;ve got it .
poor Annabella would have been too late .
- That &apos;s fair .
- Yes . what about it ?
- What about what ?
- Yourself .
- It seems there &apos;s only one way out .
- What &apos;s that ?
supposing I left you alone with this revolver ?
tomorrow &apos;s newspapers would announce that the Portland Place murderer ...
- had taken his own life .
- I thought you were coming directly .
we &apos;ve all been waiting .
- Will Mr. Hammond be staying ?
- I don &apos;t think so , dear .
well , what do you think , Mr. Hannay ?
I &apos;m afraid you leave me no alternative .
I cannot find my hymn book .
- Where did you leave it ?
- In the breast pocket of my overcoat .
it was hanging here .
I &apos;m afraid I gave it to that gentleman who was staying here that night .
cigarette cases , yes , but I &apos;ve never seen it happen to a hymn book before .
and this bullet stuck among the hymns , eh ?
I &apos;m not surprised .
some of those hymns are terrible hard to get through .
I &apos;ve stuck in them myself before now .
I &apos;m not complaining , Sheriff . &quot; hymns that have helped me . &quot;
that &apos;s a good one ! that &apos;s fine .
and to think I was drinking his champagne only half an hour before .
it &apos;s a lesson to us all : not to mix with doubtful company on the Sabbath .
and how did you escape ?
if you look through the window , you &apos;ll see .
they put the body in the dressing room .
when I came to , I borrowed this suit and pinched his car .
I don &apos;t want to hurry you , but shouldn &apos;t we take steps ?
this is serious .
otherwise , I wouldn &apos;t put myself in your hands ...
- with a murder charge hanging over me .
- Never heed the murder .
you &apos;ll be able to convince Scotland Yard of your innocence ... as easily as you &apos;ve convinced me .
I &apos;ll need a short statement I can forward to the proper authority .
I have someone coming from the police station to take it down .
thank you .
- Are you wishing to see me ?
- Indeed , I am .
do you think I enjoy playing for time with a murderer ?
- &quot; Murderer &quot; ?
- Certainly .
you &apos;re under arrest on the charge of willful murder ... of a woman unknown in Portland Mansions , London on Tuesday last .
- Take him over to the county jail .
- Every word of my story is true .
we are not so daft in Scotland as some smart Londoners may think .
do you think I believed your cock-and-bull story about the professor ?
he &apos;s my best friend in the district .
get me Professor Jordan .
if the professor didn &apos;t shoot me , where did that bullet come from ?
that &apos;s easy . from one of your pursuers on the moor .
- Isn &apos;t that so , inspector ?
- I had a shot at him myself .
I demand you allow me to telephone the High Commissioner for Canada in London .
you better do that from London .
you &apos;ll be there soon enough .
it &apos;ll save you the cost of a trunk call .
that &apos;s the professor &apos;s car .
Hannay must be inside spilling the beans .
- Stop him !
- My God !
how do you do ? we &apos;re all waiting for you .
Pamela &apos;s gone to meet you at the station . this way .
leader and standard-bearer himself .
I welcome this opportunity of discussing with you ... another question vital to the import of our country ... at this critical and momentous hour .
but first of all , as a preliminary to this ...
- I shall occupy your time ...
- You &apos;ve occupied too much time already !
we &apos;ve had enough of you !
ladies and gentlemen , I &apos;m now going to call upon the speaker of the evening .
- Speak up !
- There &apos;s no need to say who he is ... or to speak of his brilliant record as a soldier and a statesman .
he &apos;s a son of Scotland who has crossed the border and conquered England .
he is now one of the foremost figures ... in the diplomatic political world in the great city of London .
I &apos;m , therefore , going to ask him to tell you something ...
- It &apos;s about time too .
- How important it is ... to this constituency that at this crucial by-election ... our candidate should be returned by an adequate majority .
I now ask for Captain Fraser .
ladies and gentlemen , I apologize for my hesitation in rising just now ... but I &apos;d entirely failed while listening ... to the chairman &apos;s flattering description of the next speaker ... to realize he was talking about me .
as for you , may I say from the bottom of my heart ... and with the utmost sincerity ... how delighted and relieved I am to find myself ... in your presence at this moment .
delighted because of your friendly reception ... relieved because so long as I stand on this platform ...
I am delivered from the cares and anxieties ... which must always be the lot of a man in my position .
when I journeyed up to Scotland a few days ago ... traveling on the Highland Express over that magnificent Forth Bridge ... that monument to Scottish engineering and Scottish muscle ...
that is to say , on that journey I had no idea that in a few days time ...
I should find myself addressing an important political meeting .
I had planned a very different program for myself .
a very different program .
you &apos;d be for the moors to shoot something .
or somebody . I &apos;m a rotten shot .
anyhow , I little thought I should be speaking tonight ... in support of that brilliant , young statesman .
that rising ...
the gentleman on my right ... already known among you as one destined to make ... no uncertain mark in politics .
in other words , your future member of Parliament ... your candidate , Mr ...
McCrocodile .
he doesn &apos;t know the candidate &apos;s name .
I know your candidate will forgive my referring to him ... by the friendly nickname by which he &apos;s already known ... in anticipation , mark you ... at Westminster .
now , ladies and gentlemen , we &apos;ll discuss some topic .
what shall it be ?
- The herring fisheries !
- Unemployment !
- What about the idle rich ?
- That &apos;s an old-fashioned topic ... especially for me because I &apos;m not rich and I &apos;ve never been idle .
I &apos;ve been pretty busy all my life , and I expect to be much busier soon .
have you ever worked with your hands ?
indeed I have .
I &apos;ve known what it is to feel lonely and helpless ... and have the whole world against me .
those are things that no man or woman ought to feel .
I ask your candidate ... and all those who love their fellowmen ... to set themselves resolutely to make this world a happier place to live in .
a world where no nation plots against nation ... where no neighbor plots against neighbor ... where there is no persecution or hunting down ... where everybody gets a square deal and a sporting chance ... and where people try to help and not to hinder .
a world from which suspicion and cruelty ... and fear have been forever banished .
that is the sort of world I want !
is that the sort of world you want ?
fine !
that &apos;s all I have to say . good night !
- I kept them going as long as I could .
- You &apos;re a difficult man to follow .
I suppose you think you &apos;ve been damn clever .
- Tell your prisoner not to insult me .
- Try and stop me .
- Come along with me .
- I was speaking the truth .
you must have seen I was genuine .
whether you believe me or not , will you put a telephone call through ... to High Commissioner for Canada in London ?
- Tell him an important secret ...
- That will do now .
an important secret is being taken out of this country by a foreign agent .
I can &apos;t do anything myself because of this fool of a detective .
- Has that penetrated ?
- Right to the funny bone .
- Now tell me another one .
- Haven &apos;t you any sense at all ?
put that call through ! I beg of you ! refer them to me .
- Will you do this ?
- No . good night .
I beg pardon , miss , but we should like you to come too .
- Whatever for ?
- To identify the prisoner formally .
- Will you come to the police station ?
- What ?
- It &apos;s only for a few minutes .
- If it &apos;s necessary , let &apos;s get it over .
now you .
- Must I sit next to this man ?
- It &apos;s only for a short time .
be as quick as you can .
all right .
isn &apos;t that the police station ? we &apos;re running past it .
- Tell the man .
- You must have misunderstood me .
we &apos;re not exactly going to this police station .
- Where are we going ?
- To Inverary .
- Inverary ?
- Yes , miss .
this man is to be questioned by the Sheriff Principal .
- We have orders to take him there .
- You have no orders to take me .
no , miss , but I &apos;m afraid you must go .
I &apos;ll see you &apos;re sent back as early as possible .
- How far is it to Inverary ?
- Forty miles .
- Keep quiet .
- Sorry .
- We &apos;ll be there in less than two hours .
- I &apos;m spending half the night with you ?
it looks like it .
isn &apos;t the man going the wrong way ?
surely that &apos;s the way to Inverary .
there &apos;s a bridge fallen down on that road .
we shall have to go around . the man knows the way .
- Might I see your warrant ? - Shut your mouth .
you &apos;ll see it soon .
would you like to have a small bet with me , Pamela ?
all right , I &apos;ll have it with you , Sherlock .
I &apos;ll lay you 100 to 1 that your Sheriff Principal ... has the top joint of his little finger missing .
what about it ?
I win .
what are we stopping for ?
it &apos;s a whole flock of detectives .
they &apos;re all over the road . get out and clear them away .
- What about him ?
- I &apos;ll soon fix that .
there , miss . now you &apos;re a Special Constable .
- What &apos;s the idea ?
- As long as you stay , he stays .
Yes , and as long as I go , you go . come on .
stop them ! they got away !
- Come on .
- I won &apos;t !
won &apos;t you ?
- You &apos;re hurting me .
- Shut up .
see if they &apos;ve gone down that way .
where could they have gone ?
help !
let me go !
one yip out of you , and I &apos;ll shoot you first and myself after .
there &apos;s nobody down here , I tell you .
come up here , blast you , and don &apos;t waste any more time .
spread out and find them .
they must be a mile away by now .
don &apos;t do that .
do stop whistling .
you can &apos;t possibly escape .
what chance have you got tied to me ?
that question &apos;s for your husband .
I &apos;ll admit you &apos;re the white man &apos;s burden .
I know , and I can &apos;t tell you what comfort that thought gives me .
what &apos;s the use of this ?
those policemen will get you as soon as it &apos;s daylight .
they may get me , but they &apos;re not policemen .
- When did you find that out ?
- You found that out yourself .
I should never have known that was the wrong road to Inverary .
they were taking us to their boss , and God help us if they ever catch us again .
I see .
you &apos;re still sticking to your penny novelette spy story .
Oh !
there are 20 million women in this island , and I &apos;m chained to you .
listen , once more . I &apos;m telling you the truth .
I told you once in the train .
I tried to tell you after the election meeting .
I &apos;m telling you now for the third time .
there &apos;s a conspiracy against this island and we &apos;re the only ones who can stop it .
think what you &apos;ve seen happen right under your very nose .
the gallant knight to the rescue .
all right , then I &apos;m just a plain , common murderer ... who stabbed an innocent , defenseless woman in the back not four days ago .
how do you come out over that ?
I don &apos;t know how innocent you may be ... but you &apos;re a woman , you &apos;re defenseless , and you &apos;re alone ... on a desolate moor in the dark , manacled to a murderer ... who &apos;d stop at nothing to get you off his hands .
if that &apos;s the situation you prefer , have it , my lovely , and welcome .
I &apos;m not afraid of ...
for all you know , I may murder a woman a week .
so listen to a bit of advice .
do every single thing I tell you to do , and do it quick .
you big bully .
I like your pluck . come on .
- We &apos;re going in there .
- What for ?
that &apos;s my business . remember what I said : the civil tongue or else .
we &apos;re going in there , and you &apos;ll back me up on everything I say or do .
- Has that penetrated the ivory dome ?
- Only just .
pull yourself together .
put your hand in my pocket and look in a hurry .
come along .
come in . the young lady &apos;s terrible wet .
we had an accident with our car a few miles back .
- You &apos;ll be staying the night ?
- Yes .
we &apos;ve just the one room left with the one bed in it .
- But you &apos;ll not be minding that .
- No , quite the reverse .
- You &apos;re man and wife , I suppose ?
- Yes .
uh , yes .
- Have you any luggage ?
- We left that behind in the car .
maybe I could lend the young lady a nightgown .
will you please to register ? James , the book .
- Aye .
- I &apos;ll light the fire for you .
- Will you be needing supper ?
- No , thank you .
just a whiskey and soda and a few sandwiches .
- And a glass of milk .
- Very well , sir .
can &apos;t write with my left hand , but I can shoot with it .
you can guess what &apos;s in this pocket .
you sign , darling .
the sooner you get used to your new name , the better .
off we go . &quot; Mr. and Mrs. Henry Hopkinson , The Hollyhocks , Hammersmith . &quot;
I &apos;ll be back in a minute , chaps .
off with that wet skirt , and I &apos;ll have it dried in the kitchen .
don &apos;t bother. it &apos;ll dry in front of the fire just as well .
thanks all the same .
no doubt the gentleman will take care of you .
good night , sir . good night , ma &apos;am .
good night .
good night .
- Is he married to her , do you think ?
- I do not care .
they are so terrible in love with each other .
I &apos;m going to tell them the whole story .
you want to hang me for a murder I never committed ?
as long as they hang you , I don &apos;t care whether you committed it or not .
do you think I &apos;m going to spend the night with you ?
- Of course . what else can you do ?
- Can I come in ?
come here .
come in .
we were just getting warm before the fire .
I can see that . I thought you &apos;d like this in your bed .
thank you very much .
you &apos;d like a hot water bottle , wouldn &apos;t you ?
say yes , darling .
- Yes , darling .
- Very well .
- Please don &apos;t go .
- Why not ?
is anything wrong ?
of course there &apos;s nothing wrong .
she just wants to tell you something .
- We &apos;re a runaway couple .
- I knew it . they &apos;re after you ?
you won &apos;t give us away , will you ? please .
of course we will not give you up .
a good night to you both .
- You &apos;ll not be disturbed .
- But ...
thank God for a bite to eat . come along .
there you are .
what &apos;s the next item on the program ?
- Get these things off .
- Right . how will we set about it ?
anything in that bag of yours that will help ?
- A pair of scissors or a hairpin ?
- Do you think a nail file would help ?
Easily. it &apos;ll take about ten years , but we can try it .
let &apos;s make ourselves comfortable .
what about that skirt of yours ? it &apos;s still pretty damp .
I don &apos;t want to be tied to a pneumonia case on top of everything else .
- Take it off . I don &apos;t mind .
- I &apos;ll keep it on , thank you .
and that is that .
my shoes and stockings are soaked .
I think I &apos;ll take them off .
that &apos;s the first sensible thing I &apos;ve heard you say .
- Can I be of any assistance ?
- No , thank you .
sorry .
- Hold this .
- Yeah .
half a minute .
- Thank you .
- Don &apos;t mention it .
- Do you like your milk now ?
- No , thank you . I &apos;ll wait a little .
all right .
Cheerio .
that &apos;s better .
- Are your feet quite warm again ?
- Yes , thanks .
come on .
will you kindly place yourself on the operating table ?
nobody &apos;s gonna hurt you . this is Armistice Day .
- Let &apos;s get some rest while we can .
- I &apos;m not going to lie on this bed .
so long as you &apos;re chained to me , you &apos;ll lie wherever I lie .
- We &apos;re the Siamese twins .
- Don &apos;t gloat .
do you think I &apos;m looking forward to waking up in the morning ... and seeing your face beside me , unwashed and shiny ?
what a sight you &apos;ll be .
give me that nail file . let &apos;s have a go at this .
thank you .
there I go again .
I wish I could get that damn tune out of my head .
I wonder where I heard it .
- You sound very sleepy .
- Sleepy ? I &apos;ll say so .
do you know when I last slept in a bed ?
Saturday night , whenever that was .
then I only got a couple of hours .
- What made you wake so soon ? dreams ?
- What do you mean &quot; dreams &quot; ?
I &apos;ve always been told murderers have terrible dreams .
but only at the first . got over that a long time ago .
when I first took to crime , I was quite squeamish about it .
- I was a most sensitive child .
- You surprise me .
used to wake screaming , thinking the police were after me .
but one gets hardened .
- How did you start ?
- Quite a small way , like most of us .
Pilfering pennies from other children &apos;s lockers at school ... then a little pocket picking , then a spot of car pinching ... then smash and grab and so on to plain burglary .
killed my first man when I was 19 .
in years to come , you &apos;ll be able to take your grandchildren ... to Madame Tussaud &apos;s and point me out .
- Which section ?
- It &apos;s early to say . I &apos;m still young .
but I &apos;ll be there , all right , in one department or another .
you &apos;ll point me out and say , &quot; Chicks , if I were to tell you ... how matey I once was with that gentleman , you &apos;d be ... &quot;
- What &apos;s the matter ?
- This handcuff is pinching my wrist .
sorry .
talking of Madame Tussaud &apos;s , that &apos;s how it all began .
- What began ?
- My career of crime .
all hereditary . great Uncle Penruddock .
- Who was he ?
- My girl , where were you brought up ?
never heard of my Great Uncle Penruddock , the Cornish Bluebeard ?
- Got it all from him .
- I thought your family came from Canada .
no , that &apos;s where they went after the Penruddock incident .
he murdered three wives and got away with it .
his third mother-in-law got the goods on him and tried to have him arrested .
did she succeed ?
no , he was too quick for her .
took her for a walk to Land &apos;s End and shoved her into the Atlantic Ocean .
he &apos;s in Madame Tussaud &apos;s .
there &apos;s no doubt about his department .
you must go down and see him sometime .
can &apos;t mistake him . third on the left as you go in .
red whiskers and a harelip .
that , lady , is the sad story of my life .
poor orphan boy who never had a chance .
are you still set on giving me up to the police ?
you &apos;re sure everything &apos;s going to be all right ?
bound to be . he can &apos;t have much time .
as soon as I &apos;ve picked up you know what , I &apos;ll clear out of the country .
be careful .
wire to me .
- Good-bye , my dear .
- Good-bye .
is that Professor Jordan &apos;s house ?
can I speak to Mrs. Jordan then ?
is that Mrs. Jordan ?
he &apos;s gone to London already ?
- If you manage , I &apos;d like hot whiskey .
- I &apos;ll get the hot water .
no , he ducked down a side street , the police went the wrong way .
the girl handed him over to us , thinking we were detectives .
we had to take her as well because he told her everything .
very good , ma &apos;am . I see . Yes , ma &apos;am .
- Well ?
- The old man &apos;s got the wind up .
- He &apos;s cleared out already .
- Whatever for ?
he thought it too dangerous with Hannay on the loose .
he &apos;s warning the whole 39 Steps .
- Has he got the ... you know ?
- Yes .
he &apos;s picking up our friend at the London Palladium on the way out .
here &apos;s toddy . that will be half a crown .
- And the phone call ?
- We &apos;ll say a schilling .
- Is this a hotel as well ?
- Aye .
- Do you have people staying here ?
- Aye .
- You get a few this time of year ?
- Aye .
- Did you have anyone in tonight ? - Aye .
they weren &apos;t by any chance a young couple ?
James , do not finish !
what kind of a silly creature am I married to ?
do you want to get us all jailed ?
- How much did you take for these ?
- Half a crown .
out , the pair of you !
do not let on to anybody that you got a drink here after hours .
Ohh !
you old fool . would you give away a young couple ?
good morning .
what &apos;s the idea ? how did we get out of these ?
you didn &apos;t .
I slipped out of mine last night and camped out here .
- Why didn &apos;t you run away ?
- I did , but just as I was going ...
I discovered that you &apos;ve been speaking the truth .
I decided to stay .
may I ask what earthquake caused your brain to work at last ?
those two men were in here last night .
I overheard them telephoning .
- What did they say ?
- A lot of stuff about the 39 Steps .
- You ... Go on .
- What ?
someone &apos;s going to warn them . how can you warn steps ?
- Never mind . go on .
- Yes , and there was another thing .
someone got scared and is clearing out and ...
Yes , I know .
and is picking up someone at the London Palladium .
London Palladium ? what the devil ?
is that the professor with half of the little finger missing ?
what does he want to go there for ?
I feel such a fool , not having believed you .
that &apos;s all right .
we ought to get a move on .
- What room are those two men in ?
- No room .
they went as soon as they telephoned .
- They what ?
- Didn &apos;t I tell you ?
you let them go after hearing what they said ?
- You button-headed little idiot .
- Don &apos;t talk to me like that !
four or five precious hours wasted !
why didn &apos;t you wake me up at once ?
even you might have realized what they said was important .
why not leave well enough alone ?
let well alone ? good girl , I &apos;m accused of murder !
can &apos;t you realize the only way I can clear myself is to expose these spies ?
you still can . the man &apos;s going to the London Palladium . really ?
first or second house ?
I &apos;ll get there five hours late ! - Fine !
the show will suit you . - What &apos;s that ?
crazy Month !
you &apos;re quite right , madame .
the Air Ministry has got a new thing a lot of people are interested in .
but they are positive that no papers are missing about it ... that would be of any use to a spy .
I &apos;m certain about it .
a man is leaving the country tonight with something .
since you phoned us from Scotland this morning ... we &apos;ve made the minutest inquiries .
it &apos;s obvious I &apos;m wasting my time here .
just a moment , miss , please .
there &apos;s one thing you haven &apos;t told us .
where &apos;s Richard Hannay ?
I haven &apos;t the faintest idea .
look here , miss , you can &apos;t ...
- You &apos;re in the telephone book ?
- Yes .
if anything crops up , we &apos;ll give you a ring .
that will be all now . thank you .
tell Archer and Seagrave to get another taxi and follow that girl .
she &apos;ll lead us to Hannay .
love is a flower that blooms
cover every exit , and on no account let anyone leave the building .
you two men go in the orchestra pit .
ladies and gentlemen , we shall now sing .
come on . move along there , please . come on , sir .
- No one &apos;s allowed to leave the theater .
- Can &apos;t a mate go out and have a drink ?
- Ticket , please .
- I &apos;m just looking for someone .
- Can I go through , please ?
- Very good .
she &apos;s seen him . she &apos;s on her way down to the stalls .
may I borrow your opera glasses , please ?
excuse me . may I take your place , please ?
what are you doing here ?
I found him . he &apos;s up in that box .
you can &apos;t do anything about it . I &apos;ve been to Scotland Yard .
nothing has been stolen from the Air Ministry .
they &apos;re certain about it .
you heard those men say he got in there . there he is .
shall we take him now or wait till the interval ?
what you going to do ?
there &apos;s nothing missing . there &apos;s an end to it .
hear that tune ?
that &apos;s that damn thing I couldn &apos;t get out of my head .
now I know where I heard it before .
of course , that music hall .
Annabella &apos;s ...
ladies and gentlemen ... with your kind attention and permission ...
I have now the honor to present to you ... one of the most remarkable men in the world .
- That &apos;s the same man .
- Every day he commits to memory ... 50 new facts , and remembers every one of them .
facts from history , from geography ... from newspapers , from scientific textbooks ... millions and millions of them down to the smallest detail .
test him , ladies and gentlemen . ask him any question .
I &apos;ve got it ! of course there are no papers missing .
all the information &apos;s inside Memory &apos;s head .
Mr. Memory .
- I still don &apos;t understand .
- Don &apos;t you see ?
the details of that Air Ministry secret were borrowed , memorized by this man ... and then replaced before anyone could find out .
that &apos;s why he &apos;s here : to take Memory out of the country after the show .
- Surely ...
- Some gentlemen want to speak to you .
question , please . question , please .
- Where &apos;s the boat race ?
- When did Florence Nightingale die ?
- How tall is the Empire State Building ?
- Are you Richard Hannay ?
- There &apos;s something you should know .
- Come along quietly .
- That man on the stage ...
- Don &apos;t cause any trouble ...
- and spoil people &apos;s entertainment .
- What date did General Gordon die ?
what are the 39 Steps ?
come on , answer up ! what are the 39 Steps ?
the 39 Steps is an organization of spies ... collecting information on behalf of the foreign office of ...
keep your seats , please !
there is no need for alarm , no cause for alarm .
- I &apos;m all right .
- Sure you are .
I don &apos;t want a chair . let me rest here .
- I &apos;m all right .
- Take it easy now .
- Take it easy .
- I &apos;m all right .
get the girls on straightaway !
the girls &apos; introduction right away .
Mr. Memory , what was the secret formula ... you were taking out of the country ?
would it be all right , me telling you , sir ?
it was a big job to learn it ... the biggest job I ever tackled ...
- and I don &apos;t want to throw it all away .
- It &apos;ll be quite all right .
the first feature of the new engine is ... its greatly increased ratio of compression ... represented by R minus 1 over R to the power of gamma ... where R represents the ratio of compression and gamma ...
seen in end elevation , the axis of the two lines of cylinders ...
angle of 65 degrees .
dimensions of cylinders as follows ...
this device renders the engine completely silent .
am I right , sir ?
quite right , old chap .
thank you , sir . thank you .
I &apos;m glad it &apos;s off my mind , at last .
* My country , &apos; tis of thee
* Sweet land of liberty
* Of thee I sing
* Land where my fathers died
* Land of the pilgrim &apos;s pride *
* From ev &apos;ry mountainside
* Let freedom ring *
and now , ladies and gentlemen
and members of the graduating class Of the Pacific Night Law School , Whom it has been my duty and pleasure
to guide along the paths of legal learning ,
it is my high privilege and honor
to introduce to you the honorable Rufus Barnswell ,
who will address you on this momentous occasion .
the honorable Rufus Barnswell .
it is my privilege and honor to address you , gentlemen ,
as you step toward the new careers
for which you &apos;ve toiled and suffered and sacrificed .
your fathers and mothers and your friends
may well be proud of your courage , your determination ,
your will to succeed .
your applause must be for these young men ,
not for me ,
for such young men as one whose history I happen to know
and who sits among the graduates
because he had the courage
to lift himself above his environment ,
to overcome handicaps
which threatened to make him a criminal .
I reveal no secrets when I say to you
that this young man was the tough guy
of a tough neighborhood .
at an age when most boys were in high school ,
he was a child problem-
a problem to which his parents had no solution ,
but they didn &apos;t need it .
this boy solved his own problem .
he realized his opportunities and duties
as an American citizen ,
and with that realization came ambition ,
which has led him to toil at
the hardest manual labor by day
so that he might study
and arrive at the point in his career
at which he stands now .
that young man , ladies and gentlemen ,
sits there .
Johnny Ramirez .
Mrs. Ramirez , you should be very proud of your son .
I am , señor . I am very proud of my Juanito .
and excuse me , he was not a bad boy , Excellency .
only one little bit wild , maybe sometimes .
Julius Pasquani .
good luck .
Charlie Plonk .
Johnny Ramirez .
Ijuanito !
Ijuanito !
Ihijo !
Ihijo !
happy , Johnny ?
you bet , father .
Oh , Johnny , I think you going to be the best one .
Ah , she &apos;s the best of all .
that really belongs to you , mamacita .
if it wasn &apos;t for you-
Oh , no , Johnny mio .
and I guess you wouldn &apos;t let him get away with that crack
about me being tough .
but señor judge , she did not understand you .
and the señor police , she never understood me either , huh ?
Juanito , it is not nice
to make a fuss of your mother !
Oh .
behave .
Oh , mamacita !
Atencion .
Atencion .
a toast to you , mi muchacho .
a toast to Johnny , no ?
Isi !
Isi !
success , long life , and happiness
to a young lawyer .
Iviva !
Iviva !
Gracias .
Gracias .
no , Johnny .
with wine .
Nix , Alberto .
you know I ain &apos;t drinking .
you don &apos;t used to be that way .
well , I didn &apos;t used to be a lawyer .
that stuff got me into more trouble .
well , if you can &apos;t handle your liquor .
I can handle it , all right - By letting it alone ,
and that &apos;s just what I &apos;m doing .
Hey , hey , hey !
Johnny , I think you going to make a speech .
well , everybody , thanks .
all I got to say is this .
there was a lot of talk at graduation today
about hard work and study .
sure , it was tough ,
but look at Abraham Lincoln .
he worked hard , didn &apos;t he ?
and he studied nights , too , didn &apos;t he ?
you bet .
all right , I done - I did , I mean , like Lincoln ,
and I &apos;m going to keep on being like Lincoln .
no , Johnny !
Hmm ?
what &apos;s that ?
not with whiskers .
not with what ?
whiskers . I look in those book ,
and señor Lincoln has the whiskers .
now , please , Juanito , no .
all right , mamacita .
no whiskers .
no whiskers .
I promise .
it &apos;s like the judge said ,
&quot; this is a land of opportunity . &quot;
in America , a man can lift himself up by his bootstraps .
all he needs is strength and a pair of boots ,
and I got them .
I &apos;m quitting my job at the service station .
I &apos;m going to open my law office .
I &apos;m going to keep on working hard ,
and someday , I can be judge of the supreme court ,
and I &apos;m going to do it .
Yay !
he was a great man , mamacita .
only not so great like will someday be my Johnny .
Yeah , but none of those whiskers , huh ?
no .
Juanito , you have promised me .
all right .
no whiskers .
no whiskers .
if I only had some law books to put in here .
what for you need law books , Juanito ?
you are a lawyer now .
sure . I just want them for looks .
Juanito !
¿ Que ?
Juanito .
come here .
it is good you have it , no ?
&quot; J. Farada Ramirez . &quot;
mi Juanito .
&quot; attorney at law . &quot;
mi Juanito .
Oh , ma .
ma , that &apos;s-
Aw , gee , that &apos;s swell .
mama mia .
Aw , gee .
&quot; J. Farada Ramirez , attorney at law . &quot;
Oh , &quot; J. &quot; - Ma .
look .
there you are . &quot; J. Farada Ramirez , attorney at law . &quot;
mamacita ... but where did you get the money ?
be a good boy and mind my own business .
your wedding ring .
I &apos;ll make it up to you , mamacita .
someday I &apos;ll be the biggest lawyer in Los Angeles ,
and I &apos;ll buy you diamonds and sealskin coat
and rings on every finger .
Oh , Juanito , could it be a Persian lamb coat ?
sealskin is kind of old-fashioned .
sure , mamacita .
any kind of coat you want .
Juanito .
my poor Juanito .
but don &apos;t you understand , Jose , compadre ?
until the court fees are paid .
I thought for an old amigo ... but listen , Jose .
I don &apos;t get the fees .
I &apos;d be glad to do the work for nothing ,
but the fees must be paid in court .
the judge get a salary ?
sure , he does .
and why I must pay the court
because someone tried to cheat me ?
let me explain again .
now listen , Jose .
when you get the money ,
you come back , and we start action .
you understand now , don &apos;t you ?
I don &apos;t get the money ,
the judge doesn &apos;t get the money .
the state gets the money .
then I &apos;ll pay the money .
Buenos dias , padre .
Buenos dias , señores .
Adios , Jose .
Adios , padre .
Adios , Jose .
it goes slowly , hijo mio .
it doesn &apos;t go at all .
but I hear you have many clients .
plenty clients .
no fees .
I &apos;ve collected just $ 2.00 in the last month .
yet there must be a greater satisfaction than mere money
in helping your own people .
if I only could .
it isn &apos;t the money .
I &apos;m used to doing without that ,
but I &apos;m not getting anywhere .
they &apos;re all petty cases
before the small-claim courts ,
Justices of the Peace .
when a case amounts to something ,
the poor client hasn &apos;t got money enough
to fight it ,
and I don &apos;t get a chance to show what I can do .
at least a guy &apos;s got that coming , hasn &apos;t he ?
don &apos;t grow impatient , my son .
your chance will come .
remember - Patience is one of the virtues of our people .
sometimes it &apos;s hard
to tell the difference , isn &apos;t it ,
between patience and just giving up .
you must not grow bitter , Juanito .
anyway , I &apos;m not giving up .
I &apos;ll get a chance someday .
I &apos;ll get a break someday ,
and when I do , so help me , padre ,
nothing &apos;s going to stop me .
Johnny .
Juanito .
Juanito !
Yes , Manuel ?
you got to help me , please . I got much trouble .
well , who ain &apos;t ?
what &apos;s it this time , Manuel ?
no .
my automobile - She &apos;s no wish to go .
do you want me to sue the old heap or get an injunction ?
no , no , Johnny .
you help me , please .
if the automobile is no wish to start ,
I can &apos;t go into market and get my vegetables .
I can &apos;t deliver them ,
and , Johnny , I &apos;m going to starve , I &apos;m sure .
I &apos;m supposed to be a lawyer , not a mechanic anymore ,
which is probably my mistake .
anyway , I &apos;m coming right down .
we &apos;ll take a look at the menace to the traffic .
come along , padre .
if she won &apos;t listen to legal arguments ,
we may have to try prayer .
there we are .
I think that &apos;ll do it .
get behind the wheel , padre .
we &apos;ll wind her up .
all right , Juanito .
give her the gas , padre .
Ibueno !
there we are .
we certainly won that case , didn &apos;t we ?
thank you too much , Johnny .
you know , Johnny ,
this automobile , she and we ,
we got many years .
someday , she don &apos;t start at all ,
and Manuel stop .
you know , I think I die .
huh , considering my clients ,
I hope my law business runs as long as this truck does . Yay ! well , good night , Carlos .
good night , miss Elwell , Mr. Manville .
I hope you had a pleasant evening .
I did if I feel as well in the morning as I do now .
shall I say whoopee ?
you did yourself proud , Carlos .
Gracias , señor .
we &apos;ll see you soon , won &apos;t we ?
Hmm .
and how &apos;s your health , sweet lady ?
I feel glorious . having fun .
we do manage to have a lot of laughs together , don &apos;t we ?
don &apos;t we just ?
Whoo !
Cactus .
you know , I &apos;ve suddenly become
quite sentimental about you .
that &apos;s the first symptom of a very bad hangover ,
no .
this is not Mexican wine talking .
I really mean it .
let &apos;s us get married , Dale .
brook , darling , I made up my mind
never to marry anybody
at half past 3 : 00 in the morning
on the sidewalk of a Mexican street .
Oh , now , come on .
let &apos;s talk this over calmly and reasonably .
refuse to argue with you . you &apos;re too good a lawyer .
why shouldn &apos;t you marry me ?
now I &apos;ll ask one .
why should I ?
there &apos;s every reason in the world you should .
I &apos;m a very admirable fella .
who speaks very well of himself .
pull in your ears , my lad . we &apos;re off to the races .
look out !
Oh .
Oh .
Miss Dale Elwell , huh ?
Si .
and you say you were coming from the market , eh ?
Si , Johnny , I just going on work .
just going on to work ?
I see .
Oh , Johnny , what I going to do ? my poor automobile .
first , I &apos;m going to have a doctor look at you .
no .
it don &apos;t make no difference about me , Johnny .
you remember I told you-
automobile won &apos;t go , old Manuel won &apos;t go .
don &apos;t you worry .
I &apos;ll see that you get justice .
Si .
Johnny , and you think
you are going make them fix it real good ?
if I can &apos;t , I &apos;ve wasted five years studying law .
Gracias . Gracias al cielo .
Mrs. Ramirez , your favorite son
is going to court today
to fight his first real case and win it .
be careful , Juanito .
they are very rich .
they &apos;ll be poorer by the price of a truck
before I &apos;m through with them .
it &apos;s my first chance , mamacita ,
to show what I can do , and boy , will I show them !
you going to make them fix it pretty good ?
fix nothing .
we &apos;re going to get you a new one .
Oh , I don &apos;t know .
that old automobile , she &apos;s pretty good .
you just wait , compadre .
if I don &apos;t win today ,
you got the rottenest lawyer in town .
no .
I got the best lawyer in the whole world-
even Mexico City .
and what kind of fur coat
was it you wanted , Mrs. Ramirez ?
don &apos;t you never mind about fur coat .
it is too hot to think about even .
* porque no tienes , porque le falta *
Manuel .
¿ Si ?
how can I win this case without you ?
come on .
I going , too . Adios .
Adios .
please , holy mother ,
make it for my Juanito to win his case .
many times I ask you to help him ,
but this time , it would break his heart .
help him , blessed Mary .
I don &apos;t want a fur coat .
I only want him to win .
your honor .
after telling the plain facts about this case ,
I feel it is my duty ,
not only to my client ,
but to the court ,
to make just one more point .
I found out that the defendant
carried no insurance on her machine .
she &apos;s had so many accidents
that no insurance company will accept her as a risk .
I object , your honor .
objection sustained .
what ?
can &apos;t I-
Mr. Ramirez , former charges against the defendant ,
however well-Founded ,
can form no part of the present hearing .
proceed , please .
O.K. , your honor .
then I &apos;ll move on to another point .
it is almost sure that at the time of this accident ,
the defendant had been drinking-
was kind of drunk .
I object .
the allegation so presumptuously advanced
by my , uh , learned opponent ,
is no part of the complaint .
what is more , there are no witnesses to testify
to the condition of my client .
objection sustained .
but , your honor , I &apos;m only trying to prove-
the court realizes what counsel is trying to do .
the counsel should realize that
this court is not a law school
and that he should not come before it
without proper preparation of his case .
how can I present my case when he keeps on objecting ?
I object .
is that your way of being a lawyer-
squawking &quot; I object &quot; like a parrot ?
I object , if your honor please .
counsel &apos;s remarks about my failings
are incompetent , irrelevant , and immaterial .
objection sustained .
don &apos;t you want to hear the truth ?
don &apos;t you want to see justice done ?
this poor old man &apos;s truck was wrecked by a drunk driver .
his living has been taken away by a spoiled dame
who thinks she can get away with murder
because her old man &apos;s rich .
what &apos;s more important to this court-
a lot of legal technicalities or the truth ?
this court is interested in the truth ,
but allow me to point out , sir ,
that you , in failing to prepare your case properly ,
have failed in your duty to your client .
not only that , but you have been in contempt of court ,
for which I fine you the sum of 50-
no , I &apos;d better make it $ 25 .
I haven &apos;t got $ 25 .
I &apos;d like to recommend , your honor ,
that the fine be suspended .
fine suspended on recommendation of the attorney for the defense ,
and the court dismisses the case before it
because of insufficient evidence .
court is adjourned .
well , that &apos;s that . you &apos;re a free woman again ,
and you can thank your lucky stars for a good lawyer
and a bad one .
J
- Johnny , you didn &apos;t make them fix my automobile .
Why-Why , Johnny ?
what do you want ?
well , perhaps you won &apos;t believe it ,
but I &apos;d like to help your client get his truck fixed .
we don &apos;t want your pity .
Oh , that &apos;s not it .
you convinced me , even if the judge was stubborn ,
so please let me .
Aw , please .
well , that &apos;s swell of you to-
after I couldn &apos;t make you do it .
O.K .
don &apos;t be a fool , Dale !
by giving him money , you admit responsibility ,
and he can still bring criminal charges .
would you ?
of course not .
promise ?
I promise .
nonsense .
as your attorney , I forbid it .
it &apos;s the same as an admission of guilt !
but he won &apos;t bring charges .
well , that &apos;s what you think .
but he just promised .
what good is a promise from a cheap shyster ?
he &apos;ll be blackmailing you-
brook !
no . no , no , Juanito .
no pelees . no pelees , Johnny .
all right , Ramirez .
but this is the last time you &apos;ll appear in court
except as a defendant .
I implied in court that you were not a good lawyer .
I say now that you &apos;re no lawyer at all .
if you knew any law , which you don &apos;t ,
you &apos;d still be mentally unfit to practice .
you ain &apos;t bawling me out because I smacked that big windbag .
you don &apos;t want a guy like me who comes from where I do to get a break .
it isn &apos;t where you come from , Ramirez .
it isn &apos;t a question of nationality or creed .
it &apos;s you .
you &apos;re a ruffian at heart-
brutal , cheap , bad-Tempered ,
and you &apos;d be that in any country in the world .
unable to hold your own
in a match of professional intelligence ,
you resort to brute force .
is that all ?
that &apos;s all , except that
as a result of your stupid performance today ,
I think that your legal career is just about ended .
you &apos;re trying to throw a scare into me , huh ?
not at all . I &apos;m merely trying to inform you
that Mr. Manville happens to be
on the grievance committee of the bar association .
why , you
- You don &apos;t think he &apos;d-
he &apos;d try and get me disbarred , do you , your honor ?
I &apos;m not a mind reader , Ramirez .
all I know is that if I were an attorney
Opposed to you
and had won my case because you had prepared your case badly ,
and after the trial , you had assaulted me ,
I certainly would do everything in my power
to have you disbarred .
but , uh , that
- The grievance committee
will ask your opinion before they do anything ,
won &apos;t they , your honor ?
undoubtedly . I &apos;ll have to tell them the truth .
well , I-I admit I sort of lost my temper-
the kindest thing I can do
is be brutally frank with you , Ramirez .
in my humble opinion , you are not a proper person
to practice law in this community .
but , judge , listen , please .
all I did was lose my temper .
it won &apos;t happen again , I ...
I studied for five years .
I worked day and night like a dog .
please , give me another chance .
Not-Not so much for-
you see , my mother , she-
she will-
please , judge .
don &apos;t you understand ?
I &apos;m sorry , Ramirez .
disbarred , huh ?
sure . disbarred ,
you think that &apos;s the way to face her ?
well , I had to do something to keep from thinking .
I &apos;m sorry for you , Johnny .
really sorry .
well , I guess I made a pretty slick job
of messing up my career .
to find oneself - That is to find real contentment .
you &apos;ll understand this , my son ,
when you &apos;re older
- As old as I am .
but I &apos;m not old !
forgive me , padre ,
but life is just starting for me .
I have a right to get ahead .
perhaps you seek to get ahead
in the wrong direction .
you mean trying to be a lawyer .
I mean putting gain and glory
and false ambition
above peace of spirit ,
trying to scale impossible heights
and forgetting the pleasant valley below .
I know , padre .
in a nice way , you &apos;re telling me to go back washing cars
or digging ditches
or being a farm laborer .
surely there is no disgrace
in such occupations . many have found happiness in them . our fathers were of the soil .
they were good men .
and you &apos;re a good man , padre , a good man ,
but I &apos;m only a man-
not even a gentleman , but a man-
and I &apos;m going to take what I want from the world .
patience , my son . patience .
I &apos;ve used patience !
for five years I was patient-
starving , working , studying ,
trying to make a gentleman of myself .
for what ?
so those white little mugs who call themselves gentlemen and aristocrats
could make a fool out of me-
break me , bar me out of court ?
you may get another chance .
you bet you I will ,
but I &apos;ll make the chance myself .
I &apos;m going to climb .
I &apos;m going to get power , money !
you seem so eager for money .
why ?
I &apos;ll tell you .
I lost my first law case
because the other fellow had $ 30,000 worth of education ,
and I had a five-And-Ten-Cent one .
they laughed at me in court
because I didn &apos;t have money enough to pay my fine .
and he thought he could insult me ,
treat me like a servant ,
not because he was a gentleman and I wasn &apos;t ,
but because his old man had a million-Dollar bankroll .
don &apos;t you see , padre ?
money is what made the difference ,
and I &apos;m going to get money .
Juanito , please ... don &apos;t go away .
it is the best thing for me , mamacita .
don &apos;t try to stop me .
here is your home .
here is all the people who know you
and love you .
the people who love me are poor-
dirt , like I am .
they can &apos;t give me what I need , mamacita ,
and I won &apos;t be dirt anymore .
I &apos;m getting out of this town .
Juanito mio .
please , why ?
I don &apos;t understand .
a guy &apos;s entitled to anything he can grab .
I have found that out ,
and I &apos;m for grabbing from now on .
Good-bye , mamacita .
I will write you as soon as I can .
Juanito !
Good-bye .
Juanito !
Good-bye , mama .
Juanito !
Juanito !
hijo mio .
Juanito .
hop in , buddy . where you going ?
where you going ?
way south .
well , that &apos;s just where I &apos;m going-Way south .
O.K. , kid .
boy , that cleans me .
give me another stack of whites , Joe .
sorry , sir . Mr. Ramirez told me not to sell you any more chips . listen , I &apos;m not taking any orders from Johnny Ramirez .
I am !
what do you want ?
say , a guy wants to pay with a check .
is Mr. Ramirez in there ?
Yeah .
he &apos;s in there with the boss .
I would not bother him now if I was you .
whatever made you think that I wanted to sell this place ?
it was sort of our idea .
you see , we thought we &apos;d get together And form a little company , you know , To kind of take care of all the gambling in town .
something like a syndicate .
so we decide , seeing you &apos;re a right guy ,
to give you a run for your money- 35 grand .
that &apos;s smart dough , Charlie .
ha ha ha !
no sale , boys .
why , the slipper &apos;s worth three times that much .
sure .
tonight , Charlie ,
but a month from now , you won &apos;t be able to get 10 gs for it .
boys , I think I heard the boss say no .
you aren &apos;t going to let your strong-Arm manager
talk for you , are you , Roark ?
you heard him .
sorry , boys .
on your way out ,
stop at the bar , and I &apos;ll buy you a drink .
what &apos;s the matter , Roark ?
can &apos;t you run your own business anymore ?
that &apos;s the way I run my business , boys .
I always surround myself with smart fellas .
keen , ain &apos;t he ?
what did he do to get himself in ?
well , I &apos;ll tell you .
a little less than a year ago ,
he blew in here looking down-And-Out
and also looking for a job .
he run into Butch Andrews .
you remember Butch - Used to be my bouncer ?
sure .
plenty tough , too .
so Butch says to him ,
&quot; just what kind of a job do you want ,
you panhandling so-And-So ? &quot; and Johnny says , &quot; your job will do , you big windbag . &quot;
he says that to Butch Andrews ?
and Butch was more surprised than you are .
he let a roar out of him like a lion ,
and he started after Johnny ,
and that &apos;s the last thing Butch remembers , I guess ,
until he come to about an hour later ,
out of a job and with a busted beezer .
ha ha ha !
so you hired Johnny because he flattened Butch .
well , I like a winner , don &apos;t you ?
come on , let &apos;s get those drinks .
give me $ 20 worth of chips .
I can lick any three men in this place .
it &apos;s lucky I feel good , and I want to fight
because , boy , when I want to fight , I &apos;m terrific !
Hello , Harry .
Oh , boy , am I having fun .
everything &apos;s great .
I ought to punch somebody right square in the nose ,
but I &apos;m having so much fun .
you want to fight , but you &apos;re too happy .
is that it ?
you said it , boy .
I love everybody ,
even the people I don &apos;t like so much .
Oh , boy , am I having fun !
you really want fun ?
sure .
what about that fun ?
well , there &apos;s a swell place up the street
- The blue mill .
there &apos;s a dump !
Oh , boy !
Oh , boy , let &apos;s go !
Johnny , you &apos;re my pal , and I love you .
well , that &apos;s great .
you just go up this street to the blue mill
and tell them you &apos;re a friend of mine .
you said it , boy .
you absolutely said it .
put it there !
Hello , Johnny !
Oh , hello , Mrs. Roark .
you saw me . why did you turn away ?
well , how have you been ?
come on , let &apos;s go inside .
sure .
Charlie will be glad to see you .
ha ha ha !
I don &apos;t need a lawyer anymore since he &apos;s working here .
you know , Johnny can draw up A better contract than a real lawyer . for instance , I &apos;ve got a mortgage on a couple of houses here in town ,
and I decides to foreclose and ... why , baby , this is a surprise .
a pleasant one ?
sure . boys , you know the wife-Marie .
Hi . how you doing ?
pardon us a minute . now , listen , baby ,
I don &apos;t like to have you coming into a joint like this .
well , it &apos;s your joint , isn &apos;t it ?
but even that don &apos;t make it a proper place for a lady .
I can &apos;t stick home all day and all night , too .
got to have a little excitement .
only fun I get is feeding the goldfish ,
and they only eat once a day .
Oh , now , be a good kid and run along home , won &apos;t you ?
I won &apos;t be out late .
Johnny , will you take the missus to her car , please ?
sure . a pleasure .
well , all right , just as you say .
be careful with your driving , honey .
and you be careful , too , lapping up the gravy .
about 2 more inches around your belt
and it will take a surveyor To measure you for a suit . ha ha ha !
a surveyor !
did you get that crack ?
that &apos;s what I call a witty dame .
ha ha ha !
she kills me !
ha ha ha !
a surveyor !
$ 693.20 .
$ 693.20 , huh ?
almost 3 grand .
not a bad take for a weeknight .
it could be better .
never satisfied , eh ?
it sure was my lucky day when you blew in here .
your luck may change , Charlie .
I don &apos;t get you .
well , Charlie ,
time for you and me to have a little talk , that &apos;s all .
well , kid , if it &apos;s a matter of me
paying you a few more bucks a week , I &apos;d be glad to .
chicken feed . I want some real dough .
you know I &apos;m worth it .
now , don &apos;t keel over when you hear this .
but I want an interest in this joint .
an interest !
because I &apos;ve got a few other propositions .
now , kid , you &apos;re not going to quit me , are you ?
Charlie , I like you .
I like you a lot ... but business is business .
well , I might be able to figure
where I could cut you in on , say , 5 % of ... still chicken feed .
25 % , or I &apos;m through Saturday .
25 % !
now , listen , boy , I &apos;m your friend .
nobody &apos;s my friend ... when I &apos;m talking money .
25 % !
holy mackerel !
say , let me talk it over with the wife first .
you bet , but I &apos;ve got to have a yes or a no by Saturday .
you can have it tonight .
come on and drive home with me .
don &apos;t forget to tell the fellows to turn the lights off
when they &apos;re through working .
no use us making the electric light company rich .
us ?
here , where are you going ?
well , I &apos;m going to open the garage door for you .
you &apos;re going to open what door ? you sit right here .
you see those two posts ?
Yeah .
keep your eye on the door when we drive between them .
say , that must be magic or something .
how &apos;s it work ?
ha ha !
come out here , and I &apos;ll show it to you .
you see this gadget here on the post ?
there &apos;s an invisible ray that shines between the two posts
and hits an electric eye .
when we drive through , we break the ray , and the door operates .
say , that must have set you back plenty to have those put in .
sure , but there &apos;s nothing too good For the house my Marie lives in . now watch the door close when we go through here .
ha !
has that got them ?
when I get my 25 % , I &apos;m going to buy me one of them gadgets .
you could knock me down with a feather .
kid , you &apos;re in .
not a single squawk from the squawker .
sure , I voted for you .
well , say , much obliged .
shake , partner .
I won &apos;t be a real partner till I &apos;m getting 50 % .
Ooh , did you ever see such a guy ?
watch out , Charlie .
you &apos;ll end up working for him .
well , I wouldn &apos;t make him such a bad boss at that .
ha ha ha !
you know , baby , I think this calls for a celebration .
how about me making us a big stack of flapjacks ?
and , boy , can I make flapjacks !
stop threatening and go and make us some .
won &apos;t take me but a minute .
ha ha ha !
won &apos;t you sit down ?
thanks .
you &apos;re a big shot now , aren &apos;t you ?
I &apos;m getting there .
don &apos;t you think of anything but pushing yourself ahead ?
anything wrong with that ?
no .
I was just trying to make polite conversation .
Oh , thanks , I don &apos;t smoke much .
you don &apos;t drink ... no bad habits at all ?
none I can &apos;t handle .
Doc , you know , I never felt so miserable in my life .
Yeah ? well , just where do you feel bad ?
well , my stomach bothers me .
I get pains across my shoulders
and sometimes in my legs .
Uh-huh . an old story to us in the dental profession-
just what I thought .
just what you thought what ?
teeth .
ha ha ha !
why , doc , what &apos;s teeth got to do with a stomachache ?
my boy , teeth are the most important organ In the entire human body . well , not mine .
I never been to a dentist in my life .
what ?
never to a dentist ?
never .
what ? wait a minute ...
Uh-huh , I was right . come on .
come on in , doc , and pour yourself a snort .
Marie &apos;s asleep , I guess .
boy , will she be tickled when I tell her about this .
now , tiptoe over and kick out one of the windows , will you ?
just to be sure I &apos;m awake .
Oh , I &apos;m sorry , dear , on the level ,
but we &apos;re going to Los Angeles .
who &apos;s we ? why , you and me . we &apos;re driving up there tonight , now .
don &apos;t you want to go and have some fun ?
I &apos;m having fun right here on my ear .

Doc carter &apos;s waiting .
what &apos;s doc carter got to do with it ?
I forgot to tell you .
he &apos;s going to take out all of my teeth
and put in a new swell set of store teeth .
is that your idea of fun for me ?
no , thank you .
Oh , now , dear . I &apos;m doing it just for you ,
so I &apos;ll stay healthy and live longer for you .
thanks too much , darling ,
but if you think I &apos;m going along , well , I &apos;m not .
I thought you &apos;d be tickled to take a little trip .
honest .
I can hardly wait .
no , you and your dentist friend
push off on your little moonlight excursion . Adios , amigo .
and don &apos;t come back with one of those sets that rattle .
Hello , Johnny .
Oh ...
I decided not to go .
well , Charlie gave me the key
and told me to put the money in the safe .
I thought he would .
that &apos;s why I decided not to go .
well , go on with what you &apos;re doing .
don &apos;t let me disturb you .
I won &apos;t .
afraid of the dark , little boy ?
the dark don &apos;t scare me ,
and you don &apos;t scare me .
listen , lady , I go for you .
I could go for you plenty ... but Charlie-
Oh , so that &apos;s the angle .
sure .
Charlie and me are partners .
we &apos;re doing swell .
what a chump I &apos;d be to let a woman-
any woman - Bust us up .
I think you must have an adding machine
where your heart ought to be .
maybe so ... but as long as it keeps adding ,
I don &apos;t kick .
someday you &apos;re going to fall hard .
not me .
I &apos;m always moving too fast .
good night , Mrs. Roark .
ha ha !
all right , boys . just get a close-up of these-
the swellest set of ivories
you ever saw off a piano keyboard-
and give a little hand to the guy that done it-
painless carter !
stand up and take a bow , boy .
tell the folks on the level
- Did it hurt , Charlie ?
did it give you any pain ?
ha ha !
only when I got the bill .
ha ha ha !
comical , huh , babe ? did you get that crack ? sure .
also I got a headache .
now , honey , don &apos;t feel that way .
let &apos;s have some fun . it ain &apos;t every night
you can set up and celebrate a new set of teeth .
is that a promise ?
I feel like a new man .
and I liked the old one so much .
she liked the old one so much !
ha ha !
did you get that , folks ?
is that rich ?
I &apos;ll tell the world I got a frau with a great sense of humor . let &apos;s have another bucket of these old bubbles .
Hey , Johnny !
here &apos;s a great boy !
come on here , Johnny ,
and dip your feet in some of this fizz water .
why , thanks , but I got plenty to do moving round the crowd .
want to look at my teeth again ?
later , later , when I have more time to enjoy them . all right , now , Johnny ,
send over a couple of gallons of champagne , will you ?
it &apos;s on the house .
there &apos;s a swell kid , huh , baby ?
Mm-hmm ... swell .
my little Marie ... my little wife is the best wife I ever had .
my hero !
my lord and master !
I &apos;d swap them both for a pack of cigarettes .
and that &apos;s what I promised to love , honor , and obey .
how &apos;s he doing ?
need you ask ?
Charlie !
I &apos;m sleepy , big boy .
sleepy ... that old wife ...
all right , Charlie .
we go home and take a little snooze .
all right , Johnny . guess I got a little plastered .
I guess you did .
Carlos !
tell him where you want it poured . thanks , Marie .
good night .
all right , lift him .
here we are .
Oh , boy , Johnny .
Whoo !
ha ha ha !
you want me to drive ? no , thanks . not tonight .
I don &apos;t think you &apos;ll be able to handle him alone .
you better let me come along .
Oh , I can handle him all right .
my little wife here will take care Of old Charlie , all right . now , Johnny , you fly away and don &apos;t annoy us .
home , James , and don &apos;t spare the horses !
so long , Johnny .
the old wife will take care of old Charlie !
Aw , Charlie , stop .
come on , let &apos;s get out of here .
come on .
Oh , sit up , you fat , drunken pig !
come on , get up and walk ! do you think I can carry you ?
Oh , stay there .
now , just one more question , please .
where was Mr. Roark when you left the garage ?
asleep in the back seat of the car . very drunk .
there are sufficient witness to that fact .
naturally I couldn &apos;t lift such a heavy man out of the car .
he must have waked up , still drunk ,
turned on the motor , tried to get back in the car ,
and-and then fallen .
thank you , Mrs. Roark .
you need upset yourself no longer . the case is quite clear-
accidental death by carbon monoxide gas .
I regret the necessity
which forced me to question you .
you &apos;ve been very kind , señor .
please accept my deepest sympathy . if there is anything this department can do to help you ,
please command me .
thank you very much .
you &apos;re welcome .
Good-bye .
Good-bye .
we may consider the disposition of the estate settled .
uh , except the insurance checks .
of course .
you want them put through for collection ?
no . the exchange is too high .
you better enter them in the states for deposit .
we &apos;ll wait until the rate goes down .
splendid .
you are fortunate in having such a shrewd adviser .
I know that only too well .
at any rate , your affairs are in excellent shape .
I am certain your worries should never be financial ,
especially if you continue to have such excellent counsel . I &apos;m sure of that .
Good-bye .
Good-bye .
here we are .
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;d have done without you , Johnny , During all this . Aw , forget it .
I &apos;ll be depending on you more .
I &apos;m just a child when it comes to business . well , I &apos;ll take care of everything .
I &apos;ll make you more money than Charlie ever thought of .
you will at that .
I &apos;m going to sell the cafe
and build a new one , real elegant ,
and charge fancy prices and get the best people-
judges , bankers , aristocrats
- And soak them good .
that is , if it &apos;s
- If it &apos;s O.K. With you .
anything you do is O.K. With me .
you know that , Johnny .
it &apos;s going to be the class of bordertown .
you know , they never really had a nice place Around this part of the country . keep it .
Oh , I-I can use the bell .
well , keep it anyway .
you &apos;ll be , uh ... well , you &apos;ll be bringing money into the safe .
I can still use the bell .
... that won &apos;t do .
I &apos;ll never stand for that .
Mr. Ramirez , the lumber- The lumber !
don &apos;t tell me it was the lumber that held you up .
I saw it on the ground two hours before you needed it .
Yes , sir , boss , but-
this job has got to move faster .
I don &apos;t care whether you do it with pick handles or bones .
you want me to kill my men ?
I want this place to open three weeks from today !
if you can &apos;t sweat some work out of these guys ,
I &apos;ll get a foreman that can .
all right , sir .

all right .
when will you have those built ?
the lumber !
he &apos;s always got something to say .

I no creep . I walk the same all the time .
Oh , shut up !
Wong !

Hello ?
Gifaro ?
this is Johnny Ramirez from the La Rueda . I &apos;m coming up to Los Angeles tomorrow
to take a look at those materials
for the interior decorations . all right , good-Bye .
say , Jim , I &apos;ve been thinking .
you know , that bar is a little too big . I want it smaller .
it &apos;s architecturally perfect .
Oh , is that so ?
well , I want it smaller , so make it smaller .
anything you say , Mr. Ramirez .
Oh , hello , Marie . came to take a look at the place ?
no .
to take a look at you .
well , I &apos;ve been meaning to come over to see you ,
but I got to stick around here and push this job , you know .
come on , I &apos;ll show you around .
no , no , let it go .
it &apos;s only a lot of lumber ,
and it doesn &apos;t make much sense to me .
listen , Johnny , how about taking me up to Los Angeles with you ?
you know , just for the ride .
I &apos;d like to , but there &apos;s a lot of work to be done , And you &apos;d only be in my way .
I wasn &apos;t in your way when you needed money to build this place !
stop squawking !
I &apos;m going to make you more dough than you ever had before .
I don &apos;t care about the money , Johnny ,
just as long as I see you once in a while .
that house is giving me the willies .
what do you mean ?
it &apos;s Charlie .
you know , I ...
I sort of hear him walking around in the living room ,
like he used to when he couldn &apos;t sleep . pretty soon he &apos;ll be writing you letters on the Ouija board .
I know it sounds silly , Johnny ,
but just humor me for the night .
take me home , will you ?
you &apos;re talking like somebody &apos;s cracked grandmother . please , Johnny .
all right , come on .
Johnny , stop , stop , will you ?
what &apos;s the matter with you ?
I said stop !
are you crazy or something ?
I &apos;m sorry , Johnny . I just wanted to get out near the door .
I guess you were thinking of something else
and didn &apos;t hear me when I asked .
I thought for a minute you were just doing it to be mean .
Oh , forgive me , Johnny .
uh , you drive the car in the garage ,
and I &apos;ll have some coffee ready for when you come in .
thank you very much .
very nice you &apos;re here .
how do you do ?
glad you &apos;re here .
boy , come here .
take this plant and put it in my office on the desk .
and put water on it every morning .
it &apos;s from my mother .
now , if you don &apos;t take care of it ,
I don &apos;t take care of you .
run along .
Oh , it &apos;s a marvelous orchestra , Johnny .
Oh , you should hear the cash register . beautiful . ha ha ha !

I certainly didn &apos;t expect you here tonight .
you certainly have a magnificent place , Mr. Ramirez .
well , that &apos;s fine .
now , don &apos;t take too much of my money away .
congratulations , Johnny .
a great place for the sucker .
sure . glad you came .
Hey , Mr. Ramirez ?
Yeah ?
there is a party of six out in the foyer
that insist on having a table .
well , they insist ?
tell them to come next week .
these people are real class , sir .
you sure ?
I am positive ,
and they demand to see the proprietor .
Oh , they demand ?
well , all right .
they can see the proprietor .
isn &apos;t this an unusual place ?
Yes , isn &apos;t it ?
my evening is now complete-
a couple of old friends who forgot to make a reservation .
don &apos;t tell me you &apos;re the proprietor .
it is the truth , nothing but the truth ,
so help me .
I suppose we can get a table .
I suppose so ... as a special favor to old friends .
Hererra ... get me the best table in the house-
but the best-
and seat these people .
he will seat you .
this way , please .
I like personal service , savage .
savage ?
aren &apos;t you afraid that I will pull the chair out From under you ? I &apos;ll take a chance .
come along , savage .
Hello ? this La Rueda ?
I want to speak to Johnny Ramirez .
this is Mrs. Roark .
I don &apos;t want to talk to the headwaiter .
I want to talk to Johnny .
one moment , please .
Mrs. Roark .
how do you do , Mrs. Roark ?
this is Herrera .
listen , you fathead , I want to talk to Johnny .
put him on and stop stalling .
he &apos;s very busy , Mrs. Roark .
it may take a few minutes to locate him .
I &apos;ll have him call you back .
like dancing ?
with you ?
very much .
you dance this well with everybody ?
well , only with dame-
with ladies like you .
and you are really the first lady I &apos;ve ever met .
is that a compliment ?
I don &apos;t insult customers .
Oh !
so I &apos;m nothing but a customer to you . no , no .
you are sort of mascot .
the first time I saw you ,
I took a poke at your boyfriend ,
and that threw me into this business
where I am making a lot of money .
and now you are here on the opening night of my place .
you must be good luck .
better not lose track of me , then .
I won &apos;t .
I wonder where in the world Dale ever met him .
Oh , he sued her once .
used to be a shyster lawyer in Los Angeles .
frightful boor .
well , he may be a boor ,
but I &apos;ll take even money he &apos;d never be a bore . he looks like something out of Carmen ,
doesn &apos;t he ?
Uh-huh . the bull .
well , thanks for the dance , miss Elwell . where are you going ?
I &apos;ve got to keep shop .
you can sit down a minute . brook , get that chair .
nobody &apos;s using it .
this is Mrs. Garner , miss martin ,
Mr. Cole , Mr. Garner .
Johnny Ramirez .
happy to know you .
there you are , Mr. Ramirez .
thank you , uh , Mr. Mandillo .
I think your place Is perfectly exquisite , Mr. Ramirez . it will do .
well , here &apos;s success .
to what ?
to you , me , us , we , them ... anything you like .
my pick ?
Uh-huh .
well , here &apos;s to ... us .
you &apos;ve done admirably since I last saw you , Mr. Ramirez . Yes . the last time ,
although you weren &apos;t admiring me ,
at least you were looking up to me .
you know , I was thinking
of putting in a perfume shop here .
there is no duty .
what do you think of the idea ?
I think it &apos;s grand .
would you get me some chalon ?
it &apos;s my favorite perfume .
like it ?
well , there are only two kinds of smells to me-
good and bad .
I think your headwaiter wants you .
Yes , Herrera ?
Oh , yes .
uh , I have something to attend .
you will excuse me , please ?
you promise to come back and dance with me again ?
aren &apos;t you afraid you will make his honor jealous ?
not at all .
I will be back .
very happy to have met you .
out of what cave
did you lure that fascinating brute ? it &apos;s the prehistoric in me .
amusing , isn &apos;t it ?
that type of hood may not be so amusing if he gets serious .
Oh , I &apos;d love to see him serious .
well , if she keeps on going the way she is now ,
you will .
I imagine he could be very dangerous .
but if he couldn &apos;t ,
he &apos;ll be a great disappointment to me .
Hi-Ho , everybody .
Hello , Wong ?
Yeah . I want to talk to Mrs. Roark .
who is it ?
Mr. Johnny said hello .
I thought you were going to call for me .
what do you mean keeping me waiting two hours ?
well , I ...
I &apos;m sorry , Marie ,
but to tell you the truth ,
I &apos;ve been so busy , that ... well , I just forgot .
Oh , you forgot , did you ?
well , who do you think you are ?
what are you snooping around here for ?
I suppose you think it &apos;s funny .
well , he can &apos;t stand me up , see ?
see ?
see ?
get out of here !
as far as the eye can see-
hundreds and hundreds of miles ... nothing but desert .
it &apos;s heavenly .
I don &apos;t see how you could have accomplished so much
in such a short time .
Oh , just lucky .
Ah , no .
I imagine you get what you go after .
most of the time .
and that makes you very happy ?
that &apos;s right .
your , uh , wife must be very proud of you .
no , she isn &apos;t . why ?
because I &apos;m not married .
what ?
a successful , bright young man like you
not grabbed off yet ?
quit riding me , will you ?
I &apos;m not riding you .
Aw , don &apos;t be so self-Conscious .
I &apos;ve never been this way before .
you make me feel kind of dumb .
you &apos;re anything but dumb , Johnny . the trouble with you is
you work too hard all your life .
you don &apos;t know how to play .
I could learn .
like me to teach you ?
sure I would . all right .
now ... now , don &apos;t be so tense .
it &apos;s a lovely night .
there &apos;s a moon , soft music ... this is really romantic , my boy .
drink it all in . enjoy it .
Dale , you ... you &apos;re swell .
of course I am ,
and we &apos;re going to have lots of fun together .
are we ?
suits me .
see ? you &apos;re improving already .
now , don &apos;t you feel nice and calm ?
no .
I &apos;ll tell you a little secret .
neither do I .
Oh , we have company .
Hello , Johnny .
Miss Elwell , meet Mrs. Roark . how do you do , miss Elwell ?
how do you do , Mrs. Roark ?
lovely patio , isn &apos;t it ? so glad you like it .
Johnny and I have planned it for so long , that ... well now it &apos;s really finished , we &apos;re just tickled to death .
Oh .
we .
haven &apos;t you told her about us ?
Johnny and I have been partners For some time now .
he does most of the work ,
and I furnish most of the money .
that seems fair enough .
Yes , it &apos;s worked into a very pleasant partnership
in every way .
that reminds me . there &apos;s a very important business I &apos;d like to talk to you right now .
excuse us , will you ?
I &apos;m so sorry I interrupted your little chat .
come on . excuse us .
of course .
what are you trying to do ,
make a sap out of me ? you seem to be doing very well by yourself
without any help from me . sneaking down here , huh ? spying on me .
so I &apos;m spying on you .
one look at her and you , and I got the whole setup .
what do you mean horning in ... when I &apos;m talking to a lady ?
what thinks he &apos;s a gentleman . you &apos;re nothing but a barroom bouncer !
you &apos;ll always be one !
Marie ...
I &apos;m advising you to keep quiet .
if it wasn &apos;t for me ,
you &apos;d still be rolling drunks at the silver slipper .
I made you rich , put swell clothes on your back ! now just because you got your neck washed
you think you &apos;re a gentleman !
nobody can make you that !
you &apos;re riffraff , and so am I !
you belong to me !
you &apos;re going to stay with me ,
&apos;Cause I &apos;m holding on to you !
why , I committed murder to get you ! you committed what ?
sure ! sure !
me !
I killed Charlie Roark to get you !
you ... so that &apos;s what ... why it ... makes me sick even to look at you .
Marie , I &apos;m warning you .
from now on , you stay away from this place ... and stay away from me ... or you will end up with Charlie .
Yes , sir ?
I &apos;d like to see miss Elwell .
she &apos;s not receiving , sir .
she &apos;s not what , sir ?
Miss Elwell is not receiving anyone , sir .
well , you tell her I &apos;m here ,
and see what she says , sir .
I don &apos;t think I know your name , sir .
well , I don &apos;t know yours , either .
mine &apos;s Ramirez-
John f .
Ramirez .
I &apos;ll see that miss Elwell receives your card , sir . I will help you .
please be seated . go on . go on .
run along . I &apos;m right behind you .
it &apos;s the custom of the house
to announce all guests ,
if you don &apos;t mind , sir .
Miss Dale ? Yes , Roberts ?
there &apos;s a person to see you , miss .
tell him to go away .
I did , miss , but he paid no attention .
who is he ? um , a Mr. Ra-
here &apos;s his card , miss .
here .
Oh , Johnny Ramirez .
tell him I won &apos;t be able to see him now .
why not ?
because I haven &apos;t any clothes on ,
because I &apos;m taking a sunbath ,
because I have a thousand things
to do this afternoon . what are you doing here anyway ? well , I just bought a swell new car
and came down here to take you for a ride .
boy , upstairs and get miss Elwell some clothes . Oh , Johnny , I can &apos;t .
now , either you say you &apos;ll go with me ,
or I &apos;ll tear this thing down and pull you out .
now make up your mind .
Roberts , does Mr. Ramirez appear to be kidding ?
no , miss .
Roberts , my clothes .
how do you do ?
say , boy , get my drink . it &apos;s in the car .
how do you do , ladies ?
well , here you are again .
fine . I &apos;m always glad to see you .

winning ?
that &apos;s fine .
Hello , Herrera .
how are you ?
fine , thank you , Mr. Ramirez .
how was the take last night ?
700 over the night before .
not bad .
if we don &apos;t run out of suckers
and the suckers don &apos;t run out of money ,
we &apos;ll pay off the mortgage on the old homestead .
what are you doing here ? just looking after my interests .
I thought I told you to stay away from me . somebody has to stay here
while you play Casanova in Los Angeles .
you can stay here some more because I &apos;m going back .
you &apos;re going to go up there to see her ?
what about it ?
well , I ...
I hope you enjoyed yourself . you bet I did .
I had the best time of my life .
and as soon as I sign this payroll ,
I &apos;m going back to have a better time .
she &apos;s taking me to a house party with her ,
and after that , we &apos;re going to be engaged .
well ... well , as long as that &apos;s the way it is ,
I might just as well be a good sport about it . best of luck .
thanks .
you don &apos;t believe me , do you , Johnny ?
no , I don &apos;t .
well , it &apos;s the truth , Johnny . I want to see you happy .
I want to see you get places .
Yeah .
I &apos;ve got to hurry and pack my golf clothes and dress suit .
see you later .
Yes , Johnny ...
I &apos;ll be seeing you .
are you sure of that , Mrs. Roark ?
Yes , he made me kill him .
he said he &apos;d kill me if I didn &apos;t .
I was afraid of him . I had to do it .
Johnny wanted the money I could get .
Oh !
just a moment .
Inspector , will you issue a warrant For the arrest of Johnny Ramirez ? get him and bring him here right away .
in other words , you are trying to tell me
you were coerced , forced by Johnny Ramirez , Into murdering Charlie Roark ?
Yes , that &apos;s it .
Hmm .
I &apos;m going to dictate for your signature
the confession you have just made to me , Mrs. Roark . kindly correct me when I &apos;m wrong .
&quot; I , Marie Roark ...
did in effect of Johnny Ramirez ... &quot;
Hello , Louis !
how are you , Francisco ?
could I talk to you
for a minute , Mr. Ramirez ?
not now . I &apos;m in a hurry . later .
I &apos;m awfully sorry , sir , but- But ! but !
what &apos;s the matter ?
you clocked me doing 70 miles an hour coming down ?
all right . give me the ticket and hurry up . no .
that &apos;s not it , Mr. Ramirez .
we have a warrant for your arrest .
what are you talking about ? a warrant for my arrest for what ?
murder .
¿ Comida ? no . no quiero .
never mind , Guillermo .
I &apos;m getting my food sent over from the La Rueda .
Muy bien .
Comida , muchacho .
Jorges ? Guillermo ?
Guillermo ?
¿ Si , señor ?

you got visitors .
who ?
a lady
- Young , beautiful ?
all I know is you got visitors .
Abre la puerta .
¡ Madre mia !
Juanito. tell me .
no , padre . I didn &apos;t .
no , padre . he no do it .
sometimes he &apos;s bad ,
but never my Juanito lie .
and furthermore , not a natural crime
prompted by overwrought emotions ,
but a hideous crime of murder for gain-
the most vicious , contemptible act
that man can commit against society .
and now , your honor and gentlemen of the jury ,
the prosecution will prove that Ramirez ,
by reason of duress and threats
employed the wife of the murdered man
as ruthless as ever a man employed a dagger or a gun
to commit for profit
a brutal , cold-Blooded , preconceived murder !
and now with your honor &apos;s permission ,
I will call my first witness , Marie Roark .
Ahem .
raise your right hand , please .
your right hand , Mrs. Roark .
do you swear on your solemn oath before god
to give complete and honest testimony
to the utmost of your remembrance ?
do you ?
I do .
be seated , please .
state your name , please .
m
- Marie .
Marie Roark .
a little louder , please .
Marie Roark .
you were , at the time of his death ,
the legal wife of Charles Roark ?
Yes .
how long before the death of Charles Roark
were you acquainted with the defendant Johnny Ramirez ?
answer the question , please .
I ask , Mrs. Roark ,
how long before your husband &apos;s death
were you acquainted with the defendant Johnny Ramirez ?
he had so much to live for .
he was fat . he &apos;s still fat .
I can see him .
I can see him . Johnny wants me to see him .
he told Wong everything
at night when I &apos;m asleep .
Wong would never have known .
that &apos;s why Wong let me be-
Mrs. Roark-
Yes !
Yes !
Mrs. Roark .
I &apos;m Charlie Roark &apos;s wife . that &apos;s me .
remove the witness immediately .
Yes !
Charlie Roark &apos;s wife .
that &apos;s me .
order !
order in the court !
Eduardo !
your honor , I move to dismiss this case
on the grounds that the sole witness For the prosecution Is obviously insane .
Yes , Mr. Ramirez ?
now that you got my name memorized ,
go in and tell it to miss Elwell .
I &apos;m sorry , sir .
Miss Elwell isn &apos;t in . I &apos;m sorry , too , sir , but I don &apos;t believe you .
now , melt yourself down , And go in and tell her I &apos;m here .
Miss Elwell is just going out , sir .
Yeah , and I &apos;m just going in .
Johnny Ramirez , no doubt .
boy , you look swell !
Johnny , I &apos;m so glad to see you .
they gave you a pretty bad time , didn &apos;t they ?
Nah . the only tough thing about it
was I couldn &apos;t keep my date with you .
I wanted to come to the trial
to lend my , uh , moral support ,
but the family would have made it awfully messy .
that &apos;s all right . I understand .
just forget it .
I brought you something .
thank you !
what a beautiful corsage !
corsage , my hat . that &apos;s a genuine orchid .
now pin it on you , and let &apos;s get going .
let &apos;s get going ?
you and me are having dinner .
I &apos;m sorry . I can &apos;t . I was just leaving .
well , sure , with me .
no , really I can &apos;t .
I was just on my way to a dinner party .
late at that . the family already left .
horn me in . we &apos;ll sneak out early .
no , I couldn &apos;t do that .
it &apos;s one of those very stiff formal affairs-
older people , friends of the family .
tomorrow night , huh ?
I was hoping to see you
and talk an ear off you tonight .
I promise to save you my very best ear .
I &apos;ve got to run now .
let me take you .
no , Johnny . it &apos;s too far .
it &apos;s in Bel Air , beyond Beverly Hills .
fine . the further , the better .
O.K .
a genuine orchid .
is this all the fast this Model T will go ?
with you in it , yeah .
but , Johnny , I &apos;m 45 minutes late already .
but , Dale , you &apos;re going to be later .
what now ?
I want to talk to you .
my mother always told me to stay out of parked cars ,
especially when I was keeping her waiting for dinner .
I &apos;m going to hail a taxi .
Aw , now , Dale ... wait a minute .
listen .
just a minute . please .
Dale ...
I just want to tell you something .
I can &apos;t keep it any longer .
Johnny , I &apos;m not kidding .
I must get to that dinner party . I know .
I &apos;ll take you , But just listen what I &apos;ve got to say first .
it &apos;s more important than a dinner party .
all right . what ?
well , I ...
I love you .
Johnny !
the first time I saw you in court ,
I wouldn &apos;t have had the right to say it .
I was busted . I didn &apos;t amount to nothing .
now I &apos;ve got dough , and lots of it ,
and plans to make more . I &apos;m somebody .
all the work and everything was worth it
just to be able to tell you this .
that &apos;s a very nice compliment .
you &apos;re class , real class-
something a guy can love and look up to and respect ,
and I do , Dale .
I want to ...
I want to marry you .
Oh , but , Johnny , you &apos;re being romantic ,
and that &apos;s out of character .
now , listen , now , I &apos;m serious .
but you can &apos;t be .
marriage isn &apos;t for us , not even to talk about .
why , it &apos;s for me to talk about .
I love you .
I &apos;m asking you to marry me .
but that &apos;s out of the question .
you must understand that , Johnny .
no , I don &apos;t understand .
why ?
well ... because ... because you belong to a different tribe , savage .
a different tribe ?
you mean ...
I mean , there &apos;s such a thing as equality .
now please don &apos;t be annoying ! equality ?
why didn &apos;t you say that
the first time I kissed you ?
you treated me plenty like an equal
the night we went for a ride .
you made a play for me .
because I thought you were decent and swell ,
I believed it meant you loved me !
you &apos;re hurting me !
hurting you ?
you can &apos;t feel nothing
compared to the way you &apos;re hurting me !
you think you can wash yourself up
by saying you &apos;re better than other people .
I don &apos;t stand for that !
let go , you filthy brute !
brute !
savage !
I &apos;ll show you !
Dale , come back here !
come back here !
look out !
no , gentlemen , the price is $ 250,000 .
Nope . 225 is as high as we &apos;ll go , Mr. Chase .
get Ramirez on the phone .
tell him not to be a chump .
we &apos;re offering cash on the line .
my client insists that the price is 250,000 .
you know Ramirez .
either you want to buy the La Rueda ,
or you don &apos;t .
all right , then . it &apos;s a deal .
well , Ramirez is worth 250,000 more in cash .
you gentlemen have made a smart move .
say , Mr. Chase ... it &apos;s none of my business ,
but just why is Johnny selling
a gold mine like La Rueda ?
well , I ...
I understand he wants the money
to help endow a law school .
that guy giving anything to anybody ?
I &apos;m just telling you what he told me .
and I detest all my sins
because I dread the loss of heaven
and the pains of hell .
but most of all , because they offend thee , my god .
we &apos;re all good and deserving of thy love .
I firmly resolve , with the help of thy grace ,
to confess my sins and do penance
and to amend my life .
go , my boy , and pray ... for me .
thank you , padre .
well , Juanito , where to now ?
back where I belong , padre ... with my own people .
gentlemen , 1949 marks the 25th anniversary of the FBI as it exists today .
like many another success story , this one had humble beginnings .
the first G-men worked under staggering disadvantages .
do you realize that not many years ago , a fleeing kidnapper or bank robber could take one step across a state line and thumb his nose at us ?
often when we made an arrest we had to walk into a rain of hoodlum machine-gun fire though we were forbidden by law to carry a revolver .
but , gentlemen , the bureau did have as weapons truth , drive and vitality .
even before the government armed us with guns and laws G- men became a dreaded underworld whisper .
I &apos;m going to take you back to those days and show you a motion picture about a man named &quot; Brick &quot; Davis .
it &apos;s the daddy of all FBI pictures .
it &apos;s the first one that called us G-men .
the cars are old , you won &apos;t see women wearing the new look but you will see something that the bureau has never forgotten .
that while times change and habits change and styles change one thing is constant :
the man who want to get more out of life than he puts into it the hoodlum he &apos;s the same today as he was then .
he is still a public enemy .
all right , Vince .
now , ladies and gentlemen of the jury , you must know what justice can mean to a man who is defenseless because he is poor .
how would you feel if a huge corporation bulldozed you into selling your life &apos;s work an invention that has made them millions , and selling it for what ?
a paltry $ 5000 .
I ask you , ladies and gentlemen , to look upon my client .
a man who has stood silently at a workbench for years planning , working , striving to create ...
- Are you Davis ?
- Yeah , come in .
glad to meet you . my name is Joseph Kratz .
- Oh , yes . sixth Ward .
- Oh , you know me , eh ?
- Heard of you . sit down .
- Thanks .
got a good case for you , Davis . one that &apos;ll make you a lot of friends if you take it .
that &apos;s fine . what do you get out of it ?
me ? nothing . a friend of mine &apos;s in jail on a bum rap .
- I want you to defend him .
- What &apos;d he do ?
why , he got drunk last night and beat up his old lady .
- His mother ?
- Yeah .
- Nice fella .
- Well , you know how things like that are .
- They book him on assault and battery ?
- They &apos;re gonna hook him on the Sullivan Act .
the sap was carrying a gun and beat her with the butt of it .
- Accidentally ?
- Yeah , accidental .
but if she kicks off , he &apos;s up for murder .
do you think I &apos;d defend a guy like that ?
- Why not ?
- I &apos;d rather beat his brains out .
I don &apos;t want the case , Kratz . it smells .
now , wait a minute , just a minute , Davis , before you turn this down .
there are a lot of boys around my ward who &apos;ll play ball with you if you take it .
you don &apos;t want a lawyer , Kratz , you want a crook .
take your dirty work to somebody else .
now , don &apos;t pull any of that honest lawyer stuff on me .
&quot; big Shot &quot; McKay didn &apos;t pick you out of the gutter and send you through college for nothing .
- Out .
- All right , all right .
when you change your mind , let me know .
call me up . you &apos;ll never get anywhere playing shyster for that rat .
Hey !
- Eddie !
- Yeah , Eddie .
that &apos;s a swell way to treat a customer .
just a greaseball !
well , if it isn &apos;t old man Department of Justice himself .
- When &apos;d you get here ?
- Flew up this morning .
- Business ?
- Yeah .
sit down . park yourself .
well , well . what , no brass button , no badge ? what is this ?
nobody has any time to polish them .
too busy going around with a big badge frightening people .
what a lawyer . a year out of school , you &apos;re using the same argument .
and it &apos;s still good .
what &apos;s the use of going to law school if you &apos;re gonna throw it over and play cops and robbers .
if you had gone into practice , you &apos;d be at the top now instead of flatfooting around .
maybe so . but you sure look funny sitting behind a desk .
I suppose I have to entertain while you &apos;re here .
not for a couple of days . I have an appointment with a chap named Durfee .
- After that , okay .
- That &apos;s swell .
I &apos;ll try to clean up most of my work . I think I can get a whole day off .
are you getting much business ?
business is terrific . I have to throw half of it out .
what &apos;s the use of kidding , Brick ?
kidding ?
you ought to keep your law books dusted off .
old eagle-eye .
- Things are pretty tough , aren &apos;t they ?
but only because I don &apos;t wanna be a shyster .
which means blackmailing and ambulance chasing .
I &apos;ve been in too many back alleys as a kid to wanna go back .
you &apos;ve gotta have a West Side office to get decent business .
and I &apos;ve got the East Side and ...
the elevated .
I wish you were in the department . you &apos;d make a good G-man .
- You starting that again ?
- Yeah . what &apos;s more , you &apos;d like it .
you &apos;d be out seeing some action instead of sitting in a law office getting fat between the ears .
it &apos;s a great department , Brick . a great bunch of fellas .
when they tackle a job , they stick to it till it &apos;s finished and no fat-faced politician standing around telling them what to do .
I brought a department report along and an application I want you to read .
now , think it over , mule . I have to shove along . I &apos;ll see you Thursday .
all right , Eddie , I &apos;ll be here .
- Well , I &apos;m out .
- Same here .
- Let you two guys fight it out .
- Check .
well , 200 .
- Two more .
- You &apos;re called .
ace full .
the guy &apos;s right , the gardenia does bring him luck .
this keeps up , I &apos;ll believe it .
- Who is it ?
- Durfee .
Hello , Leggett .
- Hello , fellas .
- Hello . what &apos;s eating you ?
the heat &apos;s on me . will you lend me some dough ?
- Dough ? you wouldn &apos;t try to rib us ?
- No , on the level .
how about that counterfeit you been printing ?
- I haven &apos;t got any .
- What ?
a government guy tailing me for the post-office job wrecked the plant .
- I &apos;ve gotta get across the state line .
- Tough break .
- Okay , Dan ?
- Yeah .
- Let us know when you &apos;re light .
- Thanks .
- I &apos;ll pay you back , double . so long .
- Don &apos;t forget that .
- No , I won &apos;t .
- Deal me out .
it &apos;s a tough break .
he ought to get himself an arsenal and stick around .
why , those government guys don &apos;t even carry rods .
you &apos;re under arrest , Durfee .
kill the lights .
give me a reacher .
- What &apos;s the matter ?
- Copper &apos;s got him .
Louie .
- How are you , Mr. Davis ?
- Is Mr. McKay in ?
- He &apos;s in his office , sir .
- Thank you .
Yeah , come in .
Oh , hello , Brick .
- Busy , Mac ?
- No , come on in .
well , sit down .
- Have a cigar ?
- No , thanks .
where have you been keeping yourself ?
I &apos;ve been sticking pretty close to the office .
- Much business ?
- No , no .
well , come on , kid , spill it . what &apos;s on your chest ?
- I wanna talk some things over with you .
- Go ahead , shoot .
tell me , Mac , how much did you spend on me ?
- I mean , education and everything ?
- About 20 grand . why ?
that &apos;s an awful lot of dough .
chicken feed when you like a guy .
was that the only reason ?
well , maybe I wanted to see a kid that had the same start in life that I had make a real success .
haven &apos;t had much success .
nobody gets ahead fast when they play the game on the level .
- That &apos;s the way you want me to play it ?
- That &apos;s the only way to play it .
I been in rackets all my life , Brick . they don &apos;t pay off . except in dough .
well , Mac , it looks like I &apos;m gonna cross you .
- You wouldn &apos;t turn crook ?
- No , no .
but I am giving up the law business . I &apos;ve tried to make a go of it , but it &apos;s no use .
guess I wasn &apos;t cut out to warm a desk chair .
well , maybe that &apos;s right . what are you gonna do ?
I &apos;ve joined the Department of Justice .
they accepted my application yesterday .
how &apos;d you happen to do this ?
Buchanan .
I got you .
they want you in Washington .
Yeah , I &apos;m leaving tomorrow morning .
that puts me on the other side of the fence from you .
that &apos;s where you ought to be .
but they &apos;re out to get you . you and everybody else in your racket .
if they assign me to go after you , I &apos;ve gotta use everything I know .
you got to play ball with them , Brick .
go to it .
now , Mac ...
you won &apos;t get me , Brick . I &apos;m going to quit .
I &apos;ve been thinking about it for a long time .
but what about Collins and Leggett and all the rest ? will they let you quit ?
they still take orders from me whether they know it or not .
- Hi , Louie .
- Gentlemen . Hi , boys .
Hi , Ruby .
Yeah , you can put them both on one .
- May I check your hat , sir ?
- No , thanks .
- Want a drink ?
- No , thanks .
- Come on , hurry up .
- Okay .
- Are you ready , Jean ?
- Okay .
- Hello , Brad .
- How are you , Louise ?
Hello , baby , how are you ?
- Busy . ever think of knocking ?
- I never knock .
it does save getting splinters in your knuckles .
- Someday someone &apos;s gonna knock you flat .
- What are you doing tonight ?
- I think I &apos;ve got a date .
- With me ?
- Nope . Brick Davis .
- Oh , is he here ?
Yes .
- See you sometime .
- So long , Mac .
don &apos;t hit any foul balls .
I &apos;ll try not to .
how are you ?
- I heard something about you , lawyer .
- You did ? what ?
- That you &apos;re gonna be a big G-man .
- That &apos;s right .
- You ought to be dumped in a ditch .
- Keep your tin badge in Washington .
if you stick your puss in our affairs , you &apos;ll get a bellyful of this . now beat it .
you made up your mind about that plant in Brooklyn ?
Yep . I &apos;m gonna sell it .
- Sell it ?
- What do you mean ?
- I &apos;m gonna retire .
- What &apos;s gonna happen to us ?
that &apos;s your affair .
you can take over and keep going if you want to , but you &apos;d be suckers .
- This game is washed up .
- Yeah , maybe .
we &apos;re not gonna let the Mob bust up . there are plenty of rackets we can move into .
not for me . I &apos;m selling out .
- What if we don &apos;t want you to sell out ?
- I sell out anyway .
I &apos;ve spent all the time I want to trying to keep you guys in line .
from now on , you can run things to suit yourself .
if they catch up with you , it &apos;s your grief . I &apos;m selling out .
- Does that make sense to you guys ?
- Yeah , that makes sense .
- Hello , stranger .
- Oh , how are you , Jean ?
well , I feel fine . I was beginning to think I had the measles the way you &apos;ve been staying away .
- I &apos;ve been awfully busy .
Yeah , I know . that &apos;s the way it always happens .
Mac puts my name up in lights , and the only person I wanna see gets tangled up .
don &apos;t you get eye strain reading law books ?
Yeah , that &apos;s why I &apos;m giving it all up . I &apos;m leaving for Washington tomorrow .
I just stopped in to see you .
- Got a law case down there ?
- No , I &apos;m closing the office .
I &apos;ve joined the Department of Justice .
- Then you &apos;ll be staying there ?
- Yeah , for a while anyway .
well , that makes things different , doesn &apos;t it ?
Yeah , a whole lot different .
you could almost call it a flying broad jump , couldn &apos;t you ?
I just told Mac about it .
- What did he say ?
- He thought it was a grand idea .
well , I think it &apos;s swell , Brick , getting into work like that .
you &apos;ll like it a lot better than a law office .
Yeah , that &apos;s the way I feel about it . I &apos;ve gotta get going .
- Sorry you can &apos;t see the show .
- Yeah , so am I , but you understand .
Yeah . Goodbyes are sort of silly , aren &apos;t they ?
- Yeah .
- Well , we can send you a bulletproof vest for Christmas .
- Yeah . so long , kid .
say , there &apos;s no rule that a G-man can &apos;t kiss an old friend goodbye , is there ?
get a comparison on those test bullets yet ?
just checking them .
you &apos;re out of luck , Jeff . they don &apos;t match .
- Which one killed Buchanan ?
- The one on the left .
I &apos;ll tell the chief .
- Morning .
- Morning .
the rifle we found isn &apos;t the one . the slugs don &apos;t check .
the fingerprints on the handcuff match Durfee &apos;s .
Buchanan had him collared when he was killed .
put that in your wire to the New York division .
- Report back here at 3 : 00 .
- Yes , sir .
let me go up to New York , chief . I &apos;d like a crack at this case .
no , I &apos;m sending Smith up . I need you here in charge of training these new men .
- More law-school graduates ?
- Three of them .
Oh , have a heart , chief . give this grief to somebody else . I &apos;ve been doing it for a year .
I made a decent record in the field for nine years .
do I have to spend the rest of my life combing these kids out of my hair ?
you &apos;re familiar with the work . and there aren &apos;t enough old hands to go around .
I &apos;m the one should be yelling , not you . we need those men . lots of them .
I know . but why can &apos;t we get more guys with police experience ?
guys that know the underworld , not just how to spout law .
these kids have as much chance of pulling through a dangerous assignment as Buchanan had .
that depends on how well you train them , Jeff .
that &apos;s your assignment . go to it .
Yes , sir .
Mr. Davis is here , Mr. Gregory . Yes , sir .
he says you &apos;re to report to Mr. McCord , the man who just left .
thank you .
- Hello .
- Well , you look like you &apos;re not going to New York .
- I &apos;m not going .
I &apos;m gonna keep on pounding the ABC &apos;s of crime into the skulls of these babes-in-arms .
law-school graduate . law-school graduate . law-school graduate .
listen : Mr. James Davis , doctor of law , doctor of philosophy , Phi Beta Kappa .
now , isn &apos;t that sweet ?
- Phi Beta Kappa .
- What &apos;s yours , &quot; Flatfooter Copper &quot; ?
who said that ? who are you ?
I &apos;m Davis . but don &apos;t let that spoil your fun . go right ahead .
so you &apos;re Mr. Davis .
- And you &apos;re McCord .
- That &apos;s right .
- And this is Mr. Farrell .
- Hiya .
- Hello .
- And we &apos;re not Phi Beta Kappas .
- No , I gathered that .
- A very funny remark .
lay off him , Jeff . he seems to be all right .
sure , a perfect legal specimen .
but I don &apos;t think I like you , Mr. Davis .
and I can &apos;t work up much of a sweat over that kisser of yours either .
however , my personal attitude will have no bearing on your advancement .
I think I &apos;ll take charge of your training personally .
there you go .
I don &apos;t want you to think I &apos;m taking advantage of you in this but the first requirement is an excellent physical condition .
second , to know how to take care of yourself in a fight .
I &apos;ve noticed that you lawyers talk most of your fights in court .
now , the first is the balance .
keep your feet wide apart so that you won &apos;t be bowled over if somebody says &quot; boo . &quot;
like this .
so ?
very good . now , the left lead .
keep your right well up and guard my lead .
well , keep it cocked . keep it up there . keep the right hand high .
that &apos;s very , very good . now we &apos;ll trade rights .
you mean , like this .
nice going , Brick .
Hey , he &apos;s a darn good lawyer .
- Yeah . how was that , better ?
- That &apos;s fine , Davis . fine .
your leverages are practically the same as in wrestling .
- Hello , Jeff .
- Hi .
jujitsu isn &apos;t hard to learn once you get used to the uses of the shifting balance .
now , try those last two attacks I showed you .
watch out for yourself . I &apos;m gonna give you the works on defense .
- All right . here we go .
- All right .
- I wasn &apos;t expecting that one .
- You &apos;ll get on to it .
- Now , try the second one .
- Second one ?
well I &apos;d like to try that one again . come ahead .
gee , I &apos;m sorry , Davis . I didn &apos;t mean to throw you off the mat .
Oh , that &apos;s all right .
are you okay ?
listen , maybe you &apos;d better call it a day and go and wash up .
- Yeah .
that &apos;s kind of a good idea .
well thanks for the workout .
- Not at all .
Hey , that kid can take it , Jeff .
Oh , yeah . Yeah .
very good .
Mr. Davis you &apos;re next .
the noise may frighten you , but we want you to get used to it .
in case they change the laws so that government agents can carry guns .
keep a stiff wrist .
the idea is to look along the barrel and try and put the bullet somewhere near the dummies over there .
I see .
like this ?
that &apos;s it .
would you mind reloading that ? I get a bit frightened .
where did you learn to shoot ?
I used to be marble champion of the Bronx .
what &apos;s the .. ?
- I &apos;m awfully sorry .
- You should be .
no , I ... I really am . so sorry .
- Are you waiting for someone ?
- Obviously .
- Perhaps I can help you .
- No , thank you .
you &apos;re very welcome .
are you waiting to see somebody ?
Oh , pardon me for staring . I &apos;m studying character in faces and I find yours interesting .
- So it appears .
chin type number two .
&quot; does not make friends easily and resents strangers . &quot;
Yeah , that &apos;s right .
&quot; eyes far apart indicates cruelty to animals .
the tendency of the skin to get purple with anger indicates high blood pressure ...
what does it say about rifles and ammunition ?
- &quot; Most effective when used on offensive . &quot;
- Does it say how offensive ?
well , we ... We all look at things differently .
Jeff !
Hello , Kay .
- How are you ?
- Just fine .
- Have a good trip down ?
- Wonderful .
- I &apos;m so glad to see you .
- Same here . where &apos;s Hugh ?
- He went to look for you .
- He met you at the station ?
- I wanted to come myself .
- I know . Hugh told me .
where have you been keeping yourself ?
I &apos;m sorry to keep you waiting but this brother of yours jumps around like a grasshopper .
- Have you seen the apartment ?
- I left my bags there . it &apos;s grand .
- Pretty good-looking for a graduate nurse .
- Oh , not bad .
and they advanced you to night supervisor ?
I &apos;m getting this vacation on full salary .
- Swell . you can buy our lunch . come on .
- Well , I should say .
extra ! federal bank truck robbed ! half a million dollars !
read all about the big robbery ! two murdered by bank bandits !
hop on these . they &apos;re the bullets that killed the bank truck guards .
check them against all the gun-marking records .
okay , Jeff .
where did you get this ?
from the right-hand front door of the car they did the shooting from .
pull me the file on Twin Loops , B-6 .
fat chance those guards had .
guy next to the driver had a shotgun and a rifle and two guys in the back blazing at them with machine guns .
twin Loops , B-6 .
- Were there any marks on that car ?
- Not one .
we traced the license , but it was stolen . Oh , yes , there was one clue :
a mashed flower on the floor of the front seat , a gardenia .
a gardenia ?
- Yes , a gardenia .
- On the side where the man with the shotgun was sitting ?
- That &apos;s right , hawkshaw .
see if you have prints on Danny Leggett , a New York gangster . please , a hunch .
they might check up with this one .
find out if we got any prints on Danny Leggett , a New York gangster .
- Yes , let me have them .
- You &apos;re marvelous .
all you have to do is hear about a gardenia , and out of 4 million prints you pick the right one , just like that .
so nice to have you realize it .
prints on Leggett . new York record .
thanks , Joe . well , we &apos;ll see how good you are .
it &apos;s a long shot .
four million to one . ought to be a cinch . I &apos;m dying .
almost too good to be true .
he &apos;s right , Jeff . Leggett &apos;s your man .
don &apos;t you think you better run along and tell Gregory , Mr. McCord ?
wait a minute , Davis .
how do you know so much about this Leggett ?
we were raised together on the East Side in the same neighborhood .
- An East Side mug with a gardenia ?
- Yeah .
- What ?
- He always wears one . it &apos;s a superstition .
- Did you find anything ?
- I &apos;ll say I did .
this rifle bullet is the same as the one that killed Buchanan .
- Yeah ?
- Positive check , same rifle .
that means Leggett . he used it in the bank robbery .
Yeah , but that &apos;s no proof he &apos;s the one who used it on Buchanan .
no , but I know how to get him and find out .
- Let me go to New York .
- Forget it . you haven &apos;t finished your course .
- But you can recommend me .
- Well , I &apos;m not going to . you &apos;re not ready .
then you won &apos;t do it because you don &apos;t like me . you never have .
but you &apos;re not man enough to say so . if Leggett killed Buchanan , I want him .
I &apos;m going over your head , McCord .
I &apos;m going to ask Gregory myself .
McCord is right , Davis , and personal differences have nothing to do with it .
we have definite rules governing procedure here , and we stick to them .
- Yes , sir .
- I wouldn &apos;t send you or any other new man .
Farrell has this assignment . you &apos;ll have your chance when you &apos;re ready for it .
that &apos;s all , Davis .
thank you , sir .
I &apos;m not going to assign you to New York .
that would tie you up in case Leggett gets across any state lines .
you &apos;ll be assigned to the district where you find him .
I want only one thing :
- Get him .
- Yes , sir .
- Good luck .
- Thank you , sir .
- See you at the airport , Jeff .
- Right .
- Well , I hope you get him , Farrell .
- Thanks .
you wanted this assignment bad , didn &apos;t you ?
Yeah . Buchanan and I were close friends .
I &apos;ll remember that .
you might keep an eye on the flower shops . Leggett buys a gardenia every day .
- Thanks , Davis .
- Oh , and watch that derby of his .
he doesn &apos;t wear a hard hat for nothing .
- I &apos;ll remember that too .
- Good luck .
- Well , how do you do , Miss McCord ?
- Oh , it &apos;s you .
Yeah . my name &apos;s Davis .
so you &apos;re Mr. Davis .
- You &apos;ve heard of me ?
- My brother mentioned you .
- Oh , yes . we &apos;re good friends .
- Didn &apos;t sound like that to me .
you mustn &apos;t mind him , he &apos;s a great kidder . you know , you &apos;re looking better today .
- You &apos;ve lost that purple angry look .
- I &apos;m glad to hear it .
- I was worried about you .
- About me ? why ?
well , we can &apos;t discuss that here .
- Couldn &apos;t I see you this evening ?
- No , I &apos;m leaving for Chicago tonight .
well , that &apos;s too bad .
just what did you want to talk to me about ?
why , I might like to have a picture of you .
- Did you think I &apos;d give you one ?
- Wouldn &apos;t you ?
- No .
- Well , I just thought I &apos;d ask .
- Are you as nice to everybody you hate ? - Yes .
and they don &apos;t get pictures .
well , thanks for letting me have it .
- I said I wouldn &apos;t give you one .
- But you have .
Hey , Davis , telegram for you .
Oh , thanks .
- Mac !
- Brick , come on in .
well , gee , I &apos;m glad to see you .
- I &apos;m glad to see you . - Come on .
sit down .
what a surprise . tell me , what are you doing here ?
me ? I &apos;m heading west .
&quot; Joseph Lynch &quot; and &quot; heading west &quot; ? what .. ?
I didn &apos;t want anybody to connect you with me , get you in a jam .
- Oh , yeah .
- Well , how you getting along ?
fine , fine . I just finished my training course .
- Never mind about me , what are you doing ?
- I &apos;m in the hotel business .
- You , in the hotel business ?
- Yeah .
- Thanks .
- I bought a summer place up in Wisconsin .
it &apos;s called Pinecrest . fishing , tourists ...
- And mosquitoes .
- Yeah , mosquitoes . all that kind of thing .
- Well , what about New York ?
- I sold everything out . I &apos;m gonna forget it .
- And you threw the Mob overboard ?
- Yep .
well , I &apos;m still looking for Leggett .
- Wanna tell me anything ?
- You wouldn &apos;t want me to , would you ?
no . forget it .
you know , I can &apos;t play ball with either side . I &apos;m kind of sitting on top of the fence .
swell place to spend a nice quiet life , but rather dull .
- Yeah .
- What about Jean ?
I don &apos;t know . she kind of dropped out of sight after I closed the cabaret .
- I haven &apos;t seen her in months .
- I &apos;d like to see her . a swell kid .
- Yeah .
- Board !
well , that &apos;s me . guess I &apos;ve gotta shove off .
I just wanted to tell you , if you get out west , come look the place over .
- I &apos;ll give you a real blowout .
- Sold .
it &apos;s a date . I &apos;m glad you let me know you were passing through .
I just wanted to check on how you &apos;re getting on .
- I &apos;ll see you sometime . - You bet you will .
I &apos;ll see to that .
- Bye , Mac .
- Goodbye .
- You send for me ?
- Yes . just making out a report on you .
before I send it to Gregory , I want the right answers to some questions .
- Riding me again ?
- If I am , it &apos;s for the last time .
you &apos;ve been making a few slips , I &apos;ve been checking up on you .
- What are you trying to get away with ?
- Nothing .
then why did you falsify your personal history in your entrance papers ?
I didn &apos;t . there &apos;s not one false statement in those papers .
they &apos;ve been checked and passed . you can &apos;t nail me on that , McCord .
I &apos;ve told them everything .
runaway from the orphanage , arrests for vagrancy and fighting , law school , all of it .
all but the one thing you knew would keep you out of here and I &apos;ve just uncovered it .
you &apos;ve been hooked up with a big bootleg outfit in New York .
the leader paid your way through law school , undercover .
set you up in law business . a very smart way for a Mob to get a stool pigeon in the Department of Justice .
- That &apos;s a lie .
- The same Mob that Leggett &apos;s in .
no wonder you could tell us all you knew about him .
it didn &apos;t hurt McKay , and it got you in here solid .
McKay had absolutely nothing to do with my coming here .
and once more , I &apos;ve never worked for him !
I haven &apos;t seen him or been in contact with him for months !
well , until ...
go on .
until you reported to him on the 3 : 45 train , drawing room A .
you &apos;ve been under observation for a week , Davis .
well , I guess that takes care of everything .
you can break me out of the service with that .
Yeah .
that seems to be what you want .
you &apos;ve been riding me for a long time but I &apos;ll give you some straight answers .
- Go ahead .
- I &apos;ll tell you about McKay .
I was a gutter rat when he found me and would probably still be one if it hadn &apos;t been for him .
he gave me a chance to go straight , do the right thing . I took it .
but he &apos;s never asked anything of me .
- Why did you join the department ?
- Because of Buchanan .
Buchanan was my friend . he was my roommate at college .
and I wanted to get the guy who killed him .
McCord , I studied law because I wanted to work for the law and for no other reason .
now , I &apos;ve taken an awful lot from you since I &apos;ve been here and you &apos;re the last man I &apos;d ask anything of unless it meant a great deal to me .
the service does .
please don &apos;t kick me out .
- Thanks .
- Thanks , nothing !
make one more fake pass , and out you go for good !
- You know the ropes around here , huh ?
- Yeah , I made some contacts .
- Collins come out with you ?
- No , he &apos;ll join us in about a month .
- Any of the rest of the Mob come out ?
- Six of them .
they got a hideout in Kansas City .
- I got one here in case you need it .
- Probably will .
we figured on staying around for a while .
thinking of opening up a bank . maybe a couple of them .
- Nice country around here .
- Yeah , I was thinking that myself .
calling all cars .
attention , all cars .
be on the lookout for a man identified as Leggett heading west on Highway 66 .
you sure this is the place ?
the second cabin . he buy gardenia from me ...
Yeah , yeah , sure . I know all about that . come on , boys .
- Tony , you stay here . all right .
- Yes , sir .
- Stick them up !
- Not this time , Leggett .
come on , get up .
move it .
put your gun up , copper . you &apos;re not gonna get hurt .
I wish I could use it on you , I &apos;d save the state a lot of money .
come on , Leggett . get into your coat .
too bad you didn &apos;t have that on when it happened .
who told you about that ?
Oh , a friend of mine . come on , get going .
- They &apos;ve got Danny . - Wait a minute .
there &apos;s too many of them .
we &apos;d better get the Mob . go on , scram .
I don &apos;t know anything about it .
- You killed Buchanan .
- You &apos;re crazy .
you used the same gun to kill that bank guard .
Oh , save your breath .
you &apos;ll talk when you get inside that jail .
- You won &apos;t keep me in any jail .
- No ? we &apos;ll see .
Yeah . we &apos;ll see .
- Paper !
- Tonight &apos;s final !
- Paper here ! - Tonight &apos;s final !
- Hello , chief .
- How are you ?
- Car ready , Al ?
- We &apos;ve got two of them .
okay . let &apos;s go .
paper . paper . tonight &apos;s final .
get readied up . they &apos;re here .
come on , let &apos;s go .
up , coppers , up !
Leggett ! the car &apos;s across the street !
scram !
the state police cannot combat these criminals .
neither can city police .
the law prohibits them from pursuing criminals across the state line .
with the automobile and airplane these gangs can get from state to state in a few hours .
the Department of Justice is handicapped .
when Hugh Farrell died in that slaughter he didn &apos;t even have a gun to defend himself .
a federal agent is not permitted to have a gun .
he can &apos;t even make an arrest without first obtaining a local warrant .
gentlemen , give us national laws with teeth in them covering the whole field of interstate crime .
permit us to work to full effect with the state police agencies and these gangs will be wiped out .
what laws do you need most ?
make bank robbery and kidnapping federal crimes .
make it a federal crime to kill a government agent or to flee across a state line to avoid arrest or to avoid testifying as a witness .
arm your agents . and not just with revolvers .
if these gangsters wanna use machine guns then give your special agents machine guns , shotguns , tear gas .
everything else . this is war !
now , understand , I don &apos;t wanna make them a group of quick-trigger men but I do want the underworld to know that when a federal agent draws his gun he &apos;s ready and equipped to shoot to kill with the least possible waste of bullets .
I know how you feel about Hugh , Jeff , and I &apos;ve decided to let you take over .
you &apos;re giving me his assignment ?
I &apos;m putting you in charge of the Chicago office .
this list is to be posted in all districts and not to come down until every name on it is accounted for .
more will be added . take the plane . I &apos;m assigning five agents to go with you .
- You pick your own men and let me know .
- Yes , sir .
send Davis in . and tell Henderson to report here at once .
Yes , I wanna talk to you . you &apos;ve been yelling for months for action .
we &apos;ll see how your nerves stand up under fire .
you &apos;re assigned to Chicago . be at the airport at 4 : 00 .
now , go on home and get packed .
it &apos;s part of the money taken in that East Chicago bank robbery .
- How much did you get ?
- Two $ 20 bills .
their serial numbers check with the list you gave us .
- Who banked them ?
- J.E. Blattner .
here &apos;s the deposit slip and the address .
&quot; J.E. Blattner , 43 ... &quot;
- When did you get them ?
- One last night . the other four days ago .
I didn &apos;t know it was hot dough , honest . I &apos;m on the level .
- Never mind that , who gave them to you ?
- I don &apos;t know him .
- What &apos;d he look like ?
- Oh , medium size .
black hair . he &apos;s a swell dresser . that &apos;s all I know ...
- Buys a flower every day ?
- Yeah , a gardenia .
- He buys lots .
- All with $ 20 bills ?
Yeah . he always carries a roll .
all right , that &apos;s all . keep your mouth shut .
you bet . I don &apos;t wanna get tangled up with you G-guys .
- So long .
- So long .
hold your fire !
I &apos;ve been waiting for this .
come on . on your feet .
on your feet .
Yeah .
he &apos;s taking a shower . any message ?
there ain &apos;t any shower there , copper .
- I &apos;ll bet that was Collins .
- Yeah ? get him out of here .
I can &apos;t help it .
every time I see you , I wonder if it &apos;s gonna be the last .
now , listen . there &apos;s no sense in you reading the papers and then coming down here all in an uproar .
I &apos;m all right .
- I &apos;ll keep on being all right .
- That &apos;s what Hugh said .
- He never had a chance .
- I know .
but he didn &apos;t have a gun either .
those guys don &apos;t like it now that we &apos;re able to give them a dose of their own medicine .
you should have seen the way Davis manhandled this Leggett .
- I &apos;m not interested in Davis .
- Yeah , well , it was a sweet job .
- But don &apos;t tell him I said so .
- Don &apos;t worry , I won &apos;t .
I don &apos;t even wanna talk to him .
- You &apos;re beginning to like him , aren &apos;t you ?
- No , I &apos;m not .
and I wish you &apos;d keep him away from the hospital too .
- Do you mean to say he &apos;s been up there ?
- Yes , he has .
he said he wanted to look over the rooms in case he ever got sick .
excuse me . there &apos;s a man here wants to see you .
- Says it &apos;s important .
- Who is it ?
- He won &apos;t say .
- All right .
wait outside , will you , Kay ?
what do you want ?
- Well , I got a message for you .
- All right , go ahead .
do you guarantee not to arrest me ?
Oh , that kind , eh ? I promise you nothing .
what have you got to say ?
the paper says youse guys is gonna take Leggett down to the state pen tomorrow keep him there till his trial , right ?
- Yeah . that &apos;s right .
well , Gerard says to tell you G-guys if you stick your nose out trying to take him to the pen there &apos;ll be another massacre .
- He said that , did he ?
- Yeah .
well , you go back and tell Gerard that I &apos;ve decided to talk Leggett to the pen myself .
tell him I &apos;ll leave here with him at 7 : 15 tomorrow morning .
I &apos;ll go to the station by car , take the 7 : 40 train and then a car to the prison .
and if he &apos;s looking for trouble , he can have it at any of those times and places .
get out !
- You can &apos;t do that , Jeff . they &apos;ll kill you .
- Nonsense .
- You can &apos;t take chances like that .
- Forget it .
think I &apos;m gonna let that Mob get away with sending their orders into this office ?
they &apos;re not playing with a bunch of helpless bank tellers .
the sooner they learn that , the better .
we &apos;re gonna make the word &quot; government &quot; poison to them if it &apos;s the last thing we do .
what does that matter to me ? I ... I can &apos;t lose you , Jeff .
you can I are alone , and I haven &apos;t got anybody .
there , there .
you &apos;re not going to lose me .
Oh , come on , sis . you don &apos;t know what this is all about .
you go back to your hospital and help take care of all those cromos with the mumps .
what &apos;s the matter ?
it &apos;s Jeff . he can &apos;t go through with it . he &apos;ll get killed .
- Oh , I wouldn &apos;t say that .
- Oh , please don &apos;t let him do it .
he &apos;s gonna try and take Leggett to prison alone . you can stop him . please !
now , you mustn &apos;t worry about that .
he &apos;ll do it beautifully .
now , you keep your little head right there , and ...
get going .
nice prison .
too bad your Mob didn &apos;t keep their promise .
you won &apos;t live long , McCord .
step on it , driver .
sit tight , Leggett .
if they start something , remember , you get it first .
watch that car .
are they dumb enough to think they can get you here ?
get him inside .
Hello .
what &apos;s the idea of trailing me ?
just wanted to see if you could get here .
any report from Division L ?
Yeah , there &apos;s no trace of Collins or Gerard . it looks as though the Mob has disappeared .
- They &apos;ve got a great hideout , wherever it is .
- I &apos;ll say they have .
unless you fellas have been taking a vacation for two weeks .
you haven &apos;t had an attack of brilliance lately . why don &apos;t you try guessing ?
they &apos;re in that circle somewhere .
only six states . we &apos;ve got them cornered .
cut out the wisecracks . what time did that .. ?
- Any luck ?
- We found Collins &apos; wife .
- Where is she ?
- Outside . wanna question her ?
I &apos;ll say I do .
bring her in , Bill .
sit down .
- We located the apartment he rented .
- The boys have been drinking varnish .
- The landlady identifies her as Mrs. Grover .
- She &apos;s crazy .
she identifies her as Mrs. Grover . that &apos;s the name they &apos;ve been using .
you &apos;re lucky that &apos;s all you heard .
you should hear her tell about the tenants in 106 .
cut out the funny stuff . where &apos;s Collins ?
- You frighten me .
- Answer the question .
I haven &apos;t the slightest idea . he &apos;s just a friend .
I dropped in and he wasn &apos;t there . these gentlemen were .
they looked at me and I looked at them . they invited me down here and here we are .
now , are you happy ? or shall I tell you about my operation ?
- Gonna keep on stalling , eh ?
- You are so bright .
McCord , I &apos;d like to speak to you for a moment .
we won &apos;t get anywhere that way . let me have a few minutes alone with her .
- Why do you think you can get her to talk ?
- I know her .
come on out , guys .
no reason why old friends shouldn &apos;t shake hands .
thanks for calling off the wolf .
funny meeting this way , isn &apos;t it ?
Yeah . not even a floor show .
tell me , why did you marry him ?
why not ?
Oh , yeah , I know , but why Collins ?
Brad &apos;s always been pretty swell to me . I &apos;ve been happy .
Oh , now , come on , don &apos;t give me that .
- Let &apos;s stop the kidding .
- I &apos;m not kidding .
all right .
when did you see him last ?
you heard me tell them . a month ago .
- I didn &apos;t expect you to tell the truth .
- Then why ask me ?
because I can &apos;t understand protecting that guy .
you know what he is and what he &apos;s done .
you know that since he &apos;s been out here he &apos;s killed two officers in cold blood .
and you tell me you &apos;ve been happy with him ?
no , I &apos;m not .
when I read that , I decided to quit . I &apos;m not going back to him .
there , that &apos;s better .
when did you marry him ?
a couple of months after the cabaret closed .
and you never told McKay ?
he &apos;s one person I didn &apos;t want to know about it .
he &apos;ll probably learn it from Brad , though .
he &apos;ll learn it from Brad ?
- Is Collins with McKay ?
- No .
- He &apos;s hiding out at McKay &apos;s lodge !
- I never told you that !
- Brick ! Brick , you can &apos;t !
- You wait there .
- Well ?
- Collins is hiding at McKay &apos;s summer hotel in Pinecrest .
- Gerard and the rest are probably with him .
- I thought you said McKay quit .
- I did , but ...
- Drake , pick seven more men .
get guns for all of them . Martin , call the police at Pinecrest .
ask them to have three cars waiting .
- Get a transport plane .
- Right .
I could go for this north woods stuff .
- It does something to you .
- You &apos;re telling me .
the idea of Mac trying to keep us out of here .
- Say , I thought you said he was a pal .
- Sure , he is . but he &apos;s a bad host .
imagine him calling this poison good liquor .
he don &apos;t even like it himself .
give us a speech , Mac , and tell the girls what a big shot you used to be .
go on , talk !
you wouldn &apos;t like what I have to say .
closed for the season . we &apos;d better stop here .
there it is .
get to the positions you were assigned on that map .
Davis , you watch the side door .
I &apos;ve got 12 : 17 . five minutes will give you time to get around the back .
when we &apos;re ready to crash in , I &apos;ll fire two shots .
you fellas go through those windows and doors , and go fast . all right .
come on , let &apos;s see if you can still stand on those heels .
excuse us , will you , Mr. McKay ?
say , what &apos;s that ?
- They &apos;ve spotted us .
- No use waiting .
come on ! we gotta move !
we might as well quit . we &apos;re not hitting anything .
keep that gun working ! keep them in the woods !
give me noise ! give me lots of noise !
come on .
- We can &apos;t make it this way !
- Side door &apos;s nearer to the cars .
okay !
you &apos;ve gotta help us out of here !
shut up ! get upstairs and lay low . we gotta make a run for it .
give them the tear gas .
tear gas !
gas !
come on , we gotta make a break for the cars !
- Who &apos;s going out and take it first , you ?
- No , none of us .
come on , Big Shot . you &apos;re big enough to be a good shield .
Mac !
- Hello , Brick .
- Mac , I didn &apos;t know it was you .
it wasn &apos;t your fault .
you &apos;re okay , kid .
funny , I was thinking about you the other day wondering when you were coming up for that ...
Oh , Mac .
- Nice work tonight , Brick .
- Road between here and Chicago is blocked .
what &apos;s the idea ?
I &apos;m washed up .
I &apos;ll mail my resignation in to the Chicago office tomorrow .
Davis .
one time you told me I was the last guy you &apos;d ever beg anything from unless it meant something to you .
- Yeah .
- Personally , that goes double with me .
but I &apos;m talking to you now as the head of this division .
I don &apos;t wanna report you as the first guy that left this service before his job was finished .
that time it meant something to you to stay .
now it means something to me to have you stay .
Oh , I know how you feel about McKay .
I &apos;d feel the same way in your spot , but you didn &apos;t kill him .
those rats could have left him inside .
they murdered him when they forced him out .
and Collins got away with it .
think it over .
- Who is it ?
- Brad . open up .
what &apos;s the idea of moving ?
I was afraid they &apos;d find me . they were looking everywhere for you .
I &apos;ll say they were looking .
they raided the lodge and knocked over everybody but me .
I know , I read the papers . you got away .
well , what are you staring about ? you don &apos;t look very glad about it .
Oh , I am , Brad . but , gee , I &apos;ve been scared to death .
- That &apos;s why I didn &apos;t leave word .
- I &apos;ll say you didn &apos;t .
I had to trace you through the trucking outfit that moved your stuff .
I &apos;d still like to know how those coppers found us up there .
- They didn &apos;t get to you , did they ?
- Oh , no . no , I &apos;ve been safe here .
Yeah , sure .
you &apos;re a smart kid .
I just got the jumps .
forget it . crack open a bottle of whiskey and we &apos;ll celebrate .
there isn &apos;t any in the house .
well , beat it down to the store and get some .
- And get me some cigarettes , will you ?
- All right .
- You &apos;ll find some food in the icebox .
- Okay .
he may be doubling back now .
- I wanna warn Jean .
- I wanna ask her a few questions myself .
- All highways , driving black touring car . license 391284 .
Collins escaped from apartment house at 2934 Modena .
Collins in Chicago ? okay , Burns .
Collins driving black touring car .
license 391284 .
- Oh , hello , Brad .
- Get rid of that car , it &apos;s hot .
- Where you going ?
- Oh , hello , Jeff .
- Why , I ... I heard that Mr. Davis was here .
- Mr. Davis , huh ?
- Was he badly hurt ?
- Nothing serious .
they took one slug out of his chest and another creased his skull .
there &apos;s nothing to worry about . he &apos;s squawking about having to stay .
- I gotta beat it , kid .
- Jeff ?
- How &apos;d he get shot ?
- Wait a minute .
he did it saving my life , and he showed a lot of nerve doing it too .
he &apos;s a great guy , Kay .
but don &apos;t tell him I said so .
- Are you sure you &apos;re all right ?
- Yeah , sure , fine . he just winged me .
if I &apos;d come out a few minutes later , I &apos;d have seen you . I could have warned you .
no , you did the right thing getting out of there as fast you could .
come in .
- Oh , I ... I &apos;m sorry .
- Oh , please don &apos;t go . come in .
- Miss Morgan , Miss McCord .
- How do you do ?
Hello .
I heard what happened . I wanted to thank you for saving Jeff &apos;s life .
Oh , it wasn &apos;t much . we had a lucky break , that &apos;s all .
did he tell you that ?
no .
I wondered .
- Are you all right ?
- Oh , yes , I &apos;m fine .
well , I won &apos;t intrude any longer .
- Good night , Miss Morgan .
- Good night .
- Good night .
- Good night .
well , I think I better go and let you get some sleep .
all right , Jean .
don &apos;t go back to that apartment .
- You can &apos;t afford to take any chances .
- It was swell of you to try to help me , Brick .
- I was a little bit late .
- Yes , but it makes things different .
I used to think that at least I owed loyalty to Brad but I realize now I don &apos;t owe him anything .
he &apos;s done enough harm without doing any more .
wait a minute . what do you mean ?
- I think I know where to find him . - No , don &apos;t try it .
stay away from him !
good night , Brick .
- Got the guns ?
- He &apos;ll have them in the shop .
you can get them at 2 : 00 . you &apos;ll need them .
McCord and his G-men are knocking every place in town .
- They &apos;re gunning for you .
- They are ?
they &apos;ll make somebody talk . when they do , they &apos;ll be down here quick .
- You better duck for Canada .
- Yeah .
- They &apos;ll blockade the roads .
- Don &apos;t worry about that .
I got a way of making McCord call off his dogs . open that door .
want me to phone if Mr. Davis starts running a temperature ?
you stay away from him . he &apos;ll be better with the doctor .
- Thanks . Goodbye .
- Goodbye .
Miss McCord .
- Yes ?
- Get in that sedan .
get in that sedan .
Yeah , this is Collins . and you can tell McCord to get all patrols off the highways .
I &apos;ve got his sister ! and if they try to stop me , I &apos;ll dump her into their laps .
and she won &apos;t be talking .
calling car 121 . car 121 .
urgent . to Special Agent McCord .
special Agent McCord . Collins has kidnapped your sister .
threatens to kill her if attempt made to capture .
don &apos;t get impatient , baby . he won &apos;t be gone long .
Oh , hiya , Mrs. Collins . come on in .
- I &apos;m looking for Brad . have you seen him ?
- Yeah , he was here .
he &apos;ll be back pretty soon .
say , you sure were lucky getting out just before the cops jumped him .
- He told you ?
- Yeah .
close , wasn &apos;t it ?
- Who &apos;s the dame ?
- That ? that &apos;s the G-guy &apos;s sister .
they got the heat on Brad , but they &apos;ll lay off when they find out he &apos;s liable to bump this chicken .
- Lose all your guns at the lodge ?
- Yeah .
well , it was a good hideout . too bad the cops got hold of your wife .
- What are you talking about ?
- Didn &apos;t you know ?
- No , I didn &apos;t .
- Why , it &apos;s a cinch she spilled it .
they had her at government headquarters the morning before they raided you .
thanks .
what &apos;s the idea of leaving ? he &apos;s coming soon .
I know . I &apos;ll be right back . I wanna get a few things .
- I &apos;m going with him .
- That &apos;s up to you .
Oh , hello there , good-looking .
- Your wife was just here .
- When ?
she just left a few minutes ago .
- She see the dame ? - Sure .
she said she &apos;s going with you .
she &apos;s gonna rat to the cops . which way did she go ?
well , that way .
wait !
come on back , they &apos;ll get you ! you got time to get away !
you can &apos;t make it !
- Did a dame go by here ?
- One just went in the lunchroom .
Hello , General Hospital ? Brick Davis , please . hurry .
- Hello , Brick ? Jean . I found him .
- At it again , huh ?
police !
operator , where &apos;s that receiver down ?
wait a minute , Mr. Davis . you can &apos;t get up yet .
- You can &apos;t get up yet !
- Shut up and get my clothes !
look here , Mr. Davis . you can &apos;t leave here .
there she is , in there .
- Special agent .
- Yes , sir .
- How is she ?
- I don &apos;t think she has a chance .
Jean .
Jean .
Brick .
you &apos;ve got to get there . garage .
809 Allen Street .
Brad &apos;s got the McCord girl in his car .
Collins has Kay ?
he &apos;s gonna try to get to Canada .
you &apos;ve got to get there first .
I wouldn &apos;t make her talk too much .
I &apos;ll see you later .
I won &apos;t be around .
sure you will .
say there &apos;s no rule that says a G-man can &apos;t kiss an old friend goodbye , is there ?
Hello , police headquarters ? special Agent Davis speaking .
Yeah , I &apos;ve located Collins . in a garage , 809 Allen Street .
809 . Yeah , send cars .
he &apos;s holding Chief McCord &apos;s sister . I &apos;m going there now . hurry !
calling all cars , Division Six . all cars , Division Six .
Collins located , 809 Allen Street .
809 Allen Street . a garage .
- Come on , step on it !
- Better give them time to clear the roads .
down .
come on , copper .
are you gonna let her have it or am I ?
come on , copper ! come on out and get it .
- You all right ?
- Did you get him ?
- Yeah , where &apos;s Kay ?
- Inside .
- Is she all right ?
- She &apos;s all right .
- Did they get him ?
- Yes , with a machine gun .
- He crashed into a building down the street .
- Kay .
- Are you okay , kid ?
- I &apos;m all right . but where &apos;s Brick ?
Oh , Jeff , he was wonderful .
- Thanks , Davis .
- A pleasure .
don &apos;t you think you better be getting back to the hospital ?
Yeah , I guess that &apos;s a good idea .
- I &apos;m going with him .
- Take good care of him , sis .
he &apos;s a great guy .
shall I tell him you said so ?
Yeah .
- How you feeling , Brick ?
- Fine .
- Take care of yourself , Brick .
- Thanks .
I &apos;m going over to get the car .
I &apos;m gonna handle your case personally .
it &apos;s gonna be nice having a nurse in the family .
no . no !
positively no !
Yes ...
Yes , j.G. Now , get this seaver .
the next one to come in late is to be fired .
why , of course , j.G. Now , these time records show
that there &apos;s only one employee without any marks against him .
number 48 .
how long has he been with us ?
eight years and never late ? say , that &apos;s the sort of people we want around here .
most decidedly , j.G .
let &apos;s raise his salary . why , certainly , j.G .
where &apos;s Jones ?
he isn &apos;t in yet .
why , it &apos;s after nine !
why , that &apos;s impossible .
Jones is never late !
have you seen Jones ?
no , I haven &apos;t .
he must be late .
my goodness me , Jones !
of all people , Jones !
good morning , Edwarse .
I had a wonderful dream last night .
I &apos;d like to tell you about it .
I wish that dream would come true some day .
but it won &apos;t , Edwarse , will it ? take your time , Abelard .
Yeah , but I ...
go ahead , Jones .
I &apos;m waiting . well , Mr. seaver , I ...
I bought a new alarm clock last week .
it carried a five year guarantee . and this morning , it went back on me .
you went back on me , Jones !
you placed me in a very difficult position !
this morning , j.G. Instructed me to raise your salary .
Oh , he did ?
Oh , thank you , Mr. seaver .
Yes , but he also gave me instructions to fire the next employee who came in late .
and you &apos;re both people , Jones .
now , what am I going to do ?
I can &apos;t raise your salary and then fire you .
that wouldn &apos;t make sense , would it ? no , sir . it wouldn &apos;t .
why do such things have to happen to me ?
all right , Jones . I &apos;ll figure something out .
Yes , sir .
you better get busy on that McIntyre account .
you &apos;re late , miss Clark !
what for ? did something happen ?
I want to know why you see fit to step in at 9 : 30 this morning !
well , if you must know , it &apos;s because I saw fit to step out at 9 : 30 last night .
it might interest you to know that j.G. Gave me orders to fire the first person who came in late ...
that &apos;s me , I guess . it most certainly is !
well , in that case , I quit . when do I go ? now ?
we don &apos;t fire people in the middle of the week .
that &apos;s mighty big of you .
now , that &apos;s my idea of a boyfriend .
He-man plus .
Sam ?
Sam , get a load of this .
look ! who is this ?
killer Mannion .
I know , but who else ?
well , what do you know about that ?
here , Charlie .
come here !
do you get it ? say , that &apos;s right !
come on !
stick &apos; em up ! Hello , killer !
I ...
I ... I wish you would leave me alone . I &apos;m way behind on the macherine ...
thank ... McIntyre account . please !
sorry , killer . we didn &apos;t mean any harm . you &apos;re aces with us , chief .
say , there &apos;s a couple of guys we &apos;d like snuffed out .
here , here !
Jones !
I &apos;ll have the vegetable plate as usual .

I saw him first !
and I telephoned the police .

but that dame won &apos;t talk ! take it easy , would you ?
the D.A. Just got here . they &apos;re sweatin &apos; them now .
she has beautiful blue eyes , but they have a cold , sinister look that mark her at once as a gangster &apos;s moll .
it &apos;s no use playin &apos; gaga , Mannion .
we &apos;ve picked up slugs Martin .
slugs Martin ? who &apos;s he ?
if you think you &apos;re going to gain anything by ...
j.G. Carpenter &apos;s outside .

Oh , that &apos;s my boss !
here he is , Mr. Spencer .
what &apos;s the idea dragging me down here without a word of explanation ?
I &apos;m a very busy man . I &apos;ll only take a minute of your time , Mr. carpenter .
I just want you to identify somebody .
take a good look at this man .
do you know him ?
I never saw him in my life .
but Mr. carpenter ,
I &apos;ve been working for you for eight years !
he says he works for you .
well , maybe he does .
we have a large office , employ over a hundred clerks , and I &apos;m ...
wait a minute . he does look a bit familiar at that .
certainly , he would , if you read the papers this morning .
why ...
why , it &apos;s Mannion .
that &apos;s right .
killer Mannion !
but Mr. carpenter ... Just a minute ! what do you want to stick to a guy like that for ?
he &apos;s got a dame in every town ! look how he ran out on that gal in des moines .

if you want to keep your nose clean , all you gotta do is open up .
turn in state &apos;s evidence , and I personally guarantee you can beat the rap .
I &apos;ll take cheese .
well , baby , you &apos;ll be interested to know mannion &apos;s just confessed .
right in there , this minute .
well , what do you think of that ?
well , I guess the jig &apos;s up . sure it is ! but not for you , kid .

Yeah , and he says you drove the death car .
he did ? Lieutenant , I &apos;ll talk now !
I &apos;ll tell everything !

no ! don &apos;t make me do it ! you don &apos;t know mannion !
he broke jail just to get me ! if I identify him ... It &apos;s too late now , slugs !

I tell you , D.A. , I don &apos;t know that much .

so you broke out to get me ?
when I &apos;m sorry to disappoint you , mannion , but you ain &apos;t got a chance ! now , you &apos;re sunk .
you &apos;ll burn for this , and I know a lot of guys that ain &apos;t gonna cry !

and that Evanston job ? mannion .
and that express company job in Peoria ?

the warden &apos;s here . Hello , warden .
Hello , Mr. Spencer .
Hello , Mac . Hello , warden .
there you are .
thought you &apos;d get away ?
I treat you like a human being , and he runs out on me . I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
I don &apos;t know what anybody &apos;s talking about .
well , you will before the night &apos;s over .
you &apos;re going to come clean with me or there won &apos;t be enough left of you to put in solitary . come on now , mannion !
who did it ? who helped you make that break ?
my name isn &apos;t mannion ! it &apos;s Jones !
the farmer &apos;s trust job in Denver ?
the mail car robbery in Colorado Springs ?
mannion . come on , tell him who did it !
who helped you make that I am ?
Lam ? what is the &quot; Lam ? &quot;
now , listen ...
wait a minute , warden .
what we want is positive identification .
are you sure he &apos;s mannion ?
if that &apos;s not mannion , you &apos;re not the district attorney .
that &apos;s it . that &apos;s enough . take him away , boys .
- Oh , my goodness . I beg your pardon , sir .
would you please tell me who I should see about the reward ?
D.A. &apos; s gotta see it , Mac .
just got a flash from the office . what about ?
mannion just robbed a bank uptown .
you &apos;ve been drinking .
I know , but it happened just a few minutes ago .
you &apos;re crazy !
I know that too ! but he just stuck up a bank !
it must have been somebody else !
well , I told the officer it couldn &apos;t happen , but it did ! the cashier and several people identified him as mannion , positively !
and the guy told them he was mannion !
but we got mannion here ! Yeah ! I can &apos;t help it .
he just robbed a bank !
get mannion ! send him here ! but if mannion just robbed ...
whoever it is , bring him back ! right .
the guaranteed trust company in Fresno ?
mannion .
that Sacramento steel company payroll stick-up ?
pardon me .
I wonder if you could tell me where to get the reward . I don &apos;t know .
where could I find Mr. Spencer ?
Mr. Spencer ?
I don &apos;t care what anybody says .
he looks more like mannion than mannion does ! well , my name isn &apos;t Jones . it &apos;s mannion .
I mean , it isn &apos;t Jannion . it &apos;s Mones !
I don &apos;t know . it &apos;s Jones ! Jones !
over here , please .
Oh , Mr. seaver , please , what &apos;s my name ?
who am I ? - Jones !
- Jones ? what are you doing here ?
I don &apos;t know , Mr. seaver . I don &apos;t know .
just a minute , boys . let me through here , please .
we &apos;ve just tracked down this man &apos;s fingerprints , D.A .
well ? there &apos;s something wrong .
they &apos;re not mannion &apos;s .
I told you my name was Jones .
I beg your pardon , sir . can you tell me where I ...
well , thank you , sir .
say , you haven &apos;t got a twin brother , have you ?
Oh , no , sir . I have no relations of any sort .
except my aunt Agatha in Bridgeport , Connecticut .
Jones , that McIntyre account you &apos;re working on ...
Oh , yes , the McIntyre !
Oh , Mr. Spencer , I should be getting back to the office , really .
did you mind ?
that &apos;s all right . you &apos;re free to go .
get out .
Oh , thank you , sir .
well , come , Jones . Yes , Mr. seaver .
gentlemen , I &apos;m sorry I caused you all this trouble .
that &apos;s all right .
but wait !
he can &apos;t leave here .
he looks too much like mannion . he &apos;d be back here in 15 minutes .
every cop in the city is looking for him .
get me the mannion files , fingerprints , photographs , everything they got , bring &apos; em in .
tell me it ain &apos;t true , Lou ! what ain &apos;t ?
I heard they got the wrong man in there . it ain &apos;t mannion !
that &apos;s right .
somebody made a mistake . somebody ?
it was me who made a mistake ! my life wasn &apos;t worth a dollar before . it ain &apos;t worth a ruble now .
mannion &apos;s sure to get me !
well , what do you want me to do ? order some crape ? you dragged me in here to identify him !
you gotta protect me !
lock me up !
put me in jail !
D.A. , he ought to leave the state . that &apos;s no good .
the police are after mannion all over the country .
then he &apos;s got to leave the country .
but gentlemen , my work at the office would ...
he has the McIntyre accounts to get up ! D.A. , slugs Martin just came in . he &apos;s afraid that mannion will get him now .
wants us to put him in jail . how about it ? that &apos;s it !
that &apos;s what we &apos;ll do with him , with this guy !
we &apos;ll stick him in the can . on what charge ?
drunk and disorderly , vagrancy , and anything as long as he &apos;s locked up .
that &apos;s not a bad idea .
send him up to my place . I have a few spare cells . gentlemen , I ...
I hardly think that I could ...
what are we going to do about the McIntyre account ? I could fix one of them up , nice and home-like , with flowers and everything , and he can stay there until we get mannion !
gentlemen , I don &apos;t think that that would ...
I &apos;ve got it ! Yeah .
I &apos;ll give him a letter saying he is not mannion .
then if he gets in trouble , he can flash it .
sort of a passport ?
Yeah , that &apos;s the idea .
a passport . I &apos;ll dictate it right now . Harry , get busy .
official stationery .
&quot; to whom it may concern ... &quot; This is to testify
&quot; that the holder of this letter ,
Mr ... &quot;
- Joe ... Jones . - Jones .
Yes , Arthur Ferguson Jones .
Yeah , &quot; Mr. Arthur Ferguson Jones ... &quot;
Yes , that &apos;s right .
&quot; is not to be molested by the police
&quot; because of his resemblance to one killer mannion . &quot;
D.A. , you got nothin &apos; to worry about .
we got everything sort ...
Mr. Jones , we owe you an apology .
this letter will keep you from being annoyed by the police .
but you must keep it with you at all times .
thank you very much , sir .
Oh , miss Clark , are you all right ?
never felt better in my life .
well , I &apos;ve just come back from a cross country sleigh ride .
what is it , Boyle ? what &apos;s wrong with you ? I &apos;m okay , d.A .
I just swallowed something .
newspaper men are getting impatient , d.A. All right .
Mr. Jones , the man who looks like mannion , will now say a few words .
my ... my name is Jones .
it &apos;s Arthur Ferguson Jones .
I was sitting in the restaurant , having lunch when ...
let &apos;s see the passport !
it was terribly embarrassing .
wasn &apos;t it , miss Clark ?
not to me . well , there was ...
there was a person there by the name of slugs Martin to identify him ...
he wanted to poke my eyes out as I sat there , handcuffed .
and if weren &apos;t for the police , he &apos;d have done it too . come , come , folks !
the newspapers contain a full account , I believe ! this won &apos;t help you to get out the McIntyre account , Jones .
j.G. Wants to see you , jonesy .
j.G. , the boss , in his office .
he &apos;s private office ?
Oh , j.G. just sent for me .
well , what are you worrying about ? but in his private office .
I &apos;ve never been in his private office .
stop being scared !
I &apos;m responsible for all this fuss .
you know , he might fire me . just growl at him , killer .
j.G ...
Mr. carpenter wants to see me in his ...
private office .
Jones , I want you to meet Mr. Healy , a friend of mine from &quot; the record . &quot;
put her there , killer .
j.G. &apos; s just been tellin &apos; me about that marvelous publicity .
Mr. carpenter , believe me , I had no intention of getting the firm &apos;s name into this .
I merely told the reporter ...
well , if you don &apos;t mind , I &apos;m ...
come on , sit down ! sit down .
here !
have a cigar .
I &apos;m sorry , but I never ...
have one . good for ya .
smoke it .
thank you , sir .
that &apos;s the best cigar you can get .
say , Jones , I want to apologize for not identifying you this afternoon .
Mr. carpenter , my goodness , that was quite all right .
no , that was a pretty tough ordeal you went through .
I understand you fainted .
well , all those questions made me quite dizzy , sir . well , that &apos;s understandable .
I &apos;d have been a wreck myself .
Hey , look here , I understand you write .
Yes , sir . I do .
well , now , Jones ,
Healy here has got an idea he wants to talk to you about .
it &apos;s like this , jonesy , the paper figures this is a good time to pull the life story of mannion .
I &apos;ve got a hunch . who is the best man
in the world to write that story , outside of mannion himself ?
the man who looks like mannion ! good idea , I thought .
bring in the name of the firm ...
an inspiration !
swell ! do you ... you ... Do you mean you ...
you want me to write for the papers ?
make a great story !
Yes , but ...
I don &apos;t know anything about mannion .
you don &apos;t have to write the stuff you sell .
all we want is permission to use your name .
&quot; Arthur Ferguson Jones , the man who looks like mannion . &quot;
swell ! look ! we &apos;ll run your picture in the paper everyday , together with mannion &apos;s .
that we &apos;ll run another 30 days .
maybe longer !
your moniker !
your mug ! the name of the firm !
on the front page of every paper every day !
think of that , jonesy !
think of it ! Yes , sir .
I will . I &apos;ll think of it .
don &apos;t think too long , my boy .
we &apos;ve got to get started right away ! the first installment starts tomorrow .
the day after , at the latest .
now , look ...
a fine host you are , j.G. Where do you keep it ?
well , how do you like it ?
I &apos;m sorry , sir , but I don &apos;t drink ...
come on ! snap out of it !
we &apos;ve all got our hair down .
come on , a toast !
to the man who looks like mannion !
Yeah . poor jonesy .
I hope he don &apos;t lose his job .
I hope he does !
best thing in the world for him .
listen to this , &quot; Mr. Jones writes at night , &quot; hoping to storm the citadel of literary fame .
he &apos;s written for years without any encouragement . &quot;
can you imagine jonesy , an author ?
Yes , I can !
I &apos;ve always thought that rabbit had something .
say , tell me somethin &apos; , palsy .
I &apos;ll tell you something , palsy .
mannion is a false alarm .
highly overrated .
and that goes for all those criminals . a criminal is as brave as his gun .
you take his gun away and he &apos;s a coward , just like anybody else .
that &apos;s it !
that &apos;s our first lead ! what ?
&quot; &apos; mannion , false alarm , says Jones . &quot;
put it there , palsy !
it &apos;s gonna be a sensation !
there , let &apos;s have another drink ! let &apos;s have a couple more , I reckon .
this is an extra special occasion .
come on , j.G. And so long , Healy , oh , boy , oh , boy , oh , boy , oh , boy , oh , boy .
Jones !
Hello , seaver .
Hey , you know something ?
a woman is only a woman , but a good cigar ...
Hi , cymbaline !
Hey , you know what ? you know , we &apos;ve all misjudged j.G .
he &apos;s a great man , cymbaline .
heart of gold . proud to work for old j.G .
I &apos;d die for j.G ! I &apos;d die for j.G. &apos; s company !
I &apos;d die for you .
seaver ...
I &apos;ve taken the afternoon off .
j.G. &apos; s suggestion .
Oh , yes , seaver , I forgot .
you put miss Clark back on the payroll .
j.G. &apos; s order .
what ?
so long , slaves !
I always told you that rabbit had something .
Hello , Edwarse !
Hello , girl . sing and the world sings with you !
Yes , but only sing with respect ,
because I &apos;m gonna write the life of mannion .
Yes , sir . I &apos;m gonna show him up for what he is .
the big fall flusher .
just a moron with a gun in his hand .
I &apos;d like to meet that fellow . I &apos;d go right up to him , and I &apos;d say ,
&quot; why , you great , big , yellow , bl ... &quot;
all right , tough guy .
hand over .
come on !
that &apos;s perfect .
now , listen , buddy ,
I gotta go 50 / 50 on this pass .
you &apos;re gonna use it in the daytime and me at night .
it &apos;ll come in mighty handy .
that &apos;s why I dropped in to see you .
can you talk ?
Yes , sir .
well , don &apos;t . you know what &apos;s good for you , you won &apos;t open your trap without my being here ,
to nobody , understand ?
don &apos;t get careless after I leave here .
because if anything happens to me , one of my mob will take care of you .
you get that ?
Yes , sir .
okay .
now , just sit there . and don &apos;t let nobody come into this room .
I got a little work to do and ...
don &apos;t worry , Edwarse .
maybe he won &apos;t come back after all .
why aren &apos;t you in bed ?
I ... I couldn &apos;t sleep last night .
here &apos;s your passport .
two cops stopped me last night .
worked like a charm .
thank you .
I guess it &apos;ll do . all I wanna do is lay up here for a couple of days .
just long enough to take care of a rat by the name of slugs Martin .
slugs Martin ? you know , he wanted to gouge my eyes out yesterday .
he did ?
well , he ain &apos;t gonna do any more gouging when I get through with him .
what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s the morning paper .
anything about me in it ?
go on now , read it to me .
it says here you killed two guards last night .
they lie .
it was three .
go on , read it to me . &quot; at midnight yesterday , &quot;
&quot; public enemy number one , &quot;
&quot; killer mannion cold-bloodedly &quot; &quot; slewed two guards in the raid &quot;
&quot; on the state armory . &quot; &quot; accompanied by two of his men , &quot; mannion surprised the guards at the armory ... &quot;
what &apos;s the matter ?
that &apos;s all there is .
what are you talking about ?
you &apos;re gonna write about me ?
well , I can ... I can get in touch with the newspaper office and call the whole thing off , Mr. mannion .
what for ?
it &apos;s okay with me .
only be careful what you pull , that &apos;s all . Yes , sir . you oughta beat it now , will ya ?
I &apos;m getting sleepy .
Yes , sir .
what time do you knock off ?
at five o &apos;clock , sir .
Yes , sir .
bring the afternoon papers .
Yes , sir .
the afternoon papers ? you heard me .
and don &apos;t you forget it .
Yeah , and remember one word outta you , and you &apos;re out like a light .
Yes , sir .
- Good morning .
Hi there , jonesy ! Hi , jonesy .
this is Mr. Jones speaking .
Mr. Arthur Ferguson Jones .
Yes .
well , I want to talk to Mr. Healy .
Yes , I must immediately .
my goodness , he &apos;s not ?
well , will you have him call me the moment he comes in ?
Yes , it &apos;s very important ! Hiya , front page !
you busy ?
Yes , sort of . what do you got there ?
fan mail ? Yes , a most extraordinary amount of letters .
well , how do you like that ? first sign of success .
can you use a good secretary ? Oh , excuse me . this is a call I &apos;m expecting .
Yes ?
photographs ?
I &apos;m sorry , but I have no photographs ! of all the ridiculous things ...
can you imagine ... That &apos;s your public , jonesy .
you &apos;re becoming famous .
three of my girlfriends asked me to get pictures of you . I told them the kind of a caveman you were .
I can feel that kiss yet .
I want to apologize for that , miss Clark ...
what for ? if it takes a few swigs to bring out that personality of yours ,
I &apos;ll buy a case of scotch .
it wasn &apos;t the drinks .
something came over me and ...
I just couldn &apos;t help it .
I &apos;m glad you couldn &apos;t . it isn &apos;t every girl gets kissed by the man that looks like mannion .
at least , I hope it isn &apos;t .
well , I should say not !
well , well , well , good morning , Jones .
I see your boyfriend was quite busy last night up at the armory .
say , I hope you didn &apos;t have anything to do with that .
no , sir . hardly . you know , you were the topic of conversation all through dinner last night .
Mrs. carpenter wants to meet you .
I promised her I &apos;d have you up for dinner sometime soon .
I &apos;d love that , sir . that &apos;s fine . I &apos;ll let you know when .
and let &apos;s see ... I almost forgot . you know , that younger son of mine wanted me to ask you for your autograph .
do you mind ?
do you want me to ...
say , that &apos;s fine , Jones .
have a smoke .
thank you .
jonesy , you sure are going places !
just think of it , an invitation to the boss &apos; shack !
say , when those articles come out , they &apos;ll be no stopping you .
how much are they paying you for them ? I don &apos;t know .
Healy never said anything about ...
jonesy , you need a caretaker .
and I think I &apos;m elected . if you &apos;re afraid to talk to Healy ,
I &apos;m not . say , you can get enough out of this to take that trip to Shanghai .
more mail , jonesy .
Oh , my goodness .
what is it ? my aunt Agatha from Bridgeport is coming for a visit .
well , what of it ?
Yes , but I &apos;m ... I &apos;m not in the position to have any visitors just now .
why aren &apos;t you ?
I haven &apos;t seen her for five years .
now , why should she want to come here now ?
I &apos;ve got trouble enough without her ! what &apos;s a matter with you ?
you haven &apos;t got a trouble in the world !
but I have !
the McIntyre account . I &apos;d like to get it cleared up before the end of the year .
Yes , sir . I wish you &apos;d struggle through with it without the assistance of ...
Miss Clark . I get it .
has Mr. Healy come to the office yet ?
but I &apos;ve simply got to talk to him !
it &apos;s terribly important !
well , c-could you give me his home phone ? I know , I know , but ... But please ...
Yes , but I &apos;ve been trying to get Mr. Healy since 9 : 30 this morning !
well , I must get in touch with him !
it &apos;s a matter of life and death ! well , never mind . never mind .
it &apos;s the paper ! read all about mannion !
jonesy !
jonesy , I had to see ya ! I waited at the office for you to come back .
where were you ?
well , I didn &apos;t feel well . I &apos;ve been walking around all afternoon .
and I went down to the docks .
there was a freighter there leaving for Shanghai .
how I wanted to get on that boat !
after that story ? say , you &apos;d be a fool to leave here now .
I read it , and it &apos;s marvelous !
by the way , Healy was in to see you .
I made a deal for you .
he screamed murder at first , but finally , we got together . listen to this , 250 bucks a week !
I guess that trip to Shanghai is a cinch now , jonesy .
here &apos;s the contract . I told him I &apos;d get you to sign it tonight .
thank you . don &apos;t mention it . always glad to serve a public enemy .
what do you say we go up to your room and read it over ?
all right .
Oh , no ! no !
no , not upstairs .
what now ?
well , the ...
Th-the landlady is very strict about it .
Puh-lease , Mr. Jones ! you can leave the door open .
Oh , no , no .
I &apos;d rather not , if you don &apos;t mind . here , I &apos;ll ...
I &apos;ll sign this tomorrow . say , I ... I want to thank you for everything you &apos;ve done for me .
I want you to know how much I appreciate it .
no matter what happens to me .
who is it ?
it &apos;s Jones .
may I come in ?
what the devil kept ya ?
I told you to be back here by six , didn &apos;t I ? I &apos;m sorry , sir , but I couldn &apos;t get here any sooner .
when I say &quot; six , &quot; I mean &quot; six . &quot;
next time you hold me up , there &apos;ll only be one of us that looks like mannion .
Th-there wasn &apos;t anyone here to see me ?
no lady ?
no .
is that the afternoon papers ? Yes , sir .
well , let &apos;s have it .
go on , now , fix me some coffee .
Hey , jonesy !
&quot; false alarm . &quot;
you shot off a lot of steam , didn &apos;t ya ?
I &apos;m a false alarm , am I ?
I didn &apos;t write it , sir .
man on the paper did it . I ... I tried to stop him from printing it .
Yeah , I guess a lot of guys think I &apos;m a false alarm !
Oh , no !
who &apos;s gonna write the rest of these articles ? I &apos;m supposed to , but I &apos;ll call the whole thing off .
not now , you won &apos;t !
you &apos;re gonna write them , all right , only , you &apos;re gonna write them my way !
sit down !
I &apos;ll show you .
a false alarm , am I ?
well , I &apos;ll slip you some dope that &apos;ll make their heads dizzy . stuff that nobody knows .
are you ready ?
Yes , sir .
okay . now , just put down what I give ya .
don &apos;t make up nothin &apos; from your own hair . you said here , I &apos;m as brave as the gun in my hand .
now , right , you listen to this .
when I broke out of state the other day , I had a gun , yeah , but it was a phony .
that &apos;s the kind of a false alarm I am .
have you got that down ? Yes , sir . Yeah , I put the turn key on &apos; em with my hands !
then when I leave to turn the corridor , it was jammed by bricks from the law .
it was what ? every guard was soft-shoein &apos; around .
don &apos;t ask no questions .
Yes , sir .
and then I pulled a phony gun on &apos; em , told them to stick up their mitts , and I grabbed their rods , and I made &apos; em step out ahead of me , to the yard , like they was takin &apos; me to the warden &apos;s office .
we passed a dozen other guards on the way out .
I figured the whole thing out myself .
there was only one guard I had in the bag , and that was the one to the gate , but nobody knows ...
what are you makin &apos; them things for ?
why don &apos;t you put down what I give ya ?
well , Th-this is shorthand writing .
Yeah , then when I gets out into the yard , one of the guys in front of me , squawks and hot-foots it for the gate .
well , I let him have it with one of the heaters .
heaters ?
shut up !
then I grabs the other guy and I holds him in front of me , just as I &apos;m startin &apos; for the gate .
by this time , the typewriters up on the walls are cutting lose , cranking away , and the air is as thick as dust with machine gun bullets .
look at that article .
this man Jones seems to know a whole lot about mannion . if he &apos;s just a clerk , how &apos;d he get the information about the prison break ?
well , he says here one of the guards was fixed . Yeah .
how do you suppose he found that out ?
that &apos;s what I &apos;d like to know .
I thought you and I were the only ones who knew about that .
you haven &apos;t been talking , have you ?
chief , you don &apos;t think that I ... No , of course . of course .
but if you ask me , there &apos;s something queer about the whole business .
Jones ... he &apos;s at luncheon with Mr. carpenter .
why ? I don &apos;t know .
well , Mr. Chindler , what do you expect to get for nothing today ?
out of you , miss Sherlock , nothing .
where &apos;s Arthur Ferguson Jones ? he won &apos;t be back this afternoon . Half-day , Saturdays .
is it anything important ?
his first paycheck , that &apos;s all . I &apos;ll take it .
you expect to see him ?
Yeah . when ?
this afternoon . okay . tell him I want to see him as soon as possible .
there &apos;s something I want to ask him .
what do you want to know ?
who &apos;s been helping him write those stories ?
what do you mean , who &apos;s been helping him ? where does a squirt like Jones get off writing all that juicy underworld lingo ?
from me , of course .
you certainly have horned in yourself properly , haven &apos;t you ?
what do you get out of them ?
nothing . well ...
you can always do business with me .
I &apos;m only interested in Jones . one of my men ran into Jones this morning .
nearly plugged him before he could show him that paper .
you know , same thing happened to us last night . ran plumb into him . I &apos;m telling you , he nearly got a bullet right through that passport .
thought sure we had mannion .
that guy Jones is gettin &apos; in our hair .
I wish he &apos;s stay put .
well , it would make things simpler for us .
you know , Washington wants us to shoot on sight . now , how can we with this fella Jones running around ?
that &apos;s right .
that &apos;s what &apos;s holdin &apos; us up . well , then put him away !
that &apos;s it !
get Jones ! Boyle ! Yes , sir .
get Jones ! Yes , sir .
get Jones .
who is it ?
for heaven &apos;s sake , jonesy , if thought you were gonna keep me waiting out there all night ,
I &apos;d have brought a cot . well , mystery of mysteries .
I finally made it . I actually am seeing how the other half lives .
and it &apos;s just what I expected , jonesy .
cozy , warm , old-worldly , even a canary bird .
expresses your personality completely .
well , I &apos;m glad you like it .
it &apos;s adorable . and now , Mr. Jones , prepare yourself for the thrill of a lifetime .
your first paycheck !
as an author , I mean . the magic carpet which will carry you to Shanghai and eternal ecstasy .
why , you thief you !
so it was you who stole my picture .
Oh , jonesy , you &apos;re cute .
why , jonesy !
well , I ...
well ... I ... I think I better be going ...
Oh , no ...
I just came up to bring you the check ... Oh , no .
wait a minute . stick around ... Oh , no , no .
the landlady is awfully strict about this sort of thing .
Nick !
Harry ! give me the police department .
Hello , police department ?
this is miss Clark speaking .
the police are exceptionally trigger-conscious these days ,
Mr. Jones .
but you can &apos;t very well blame them for that . that &apos;s why we want to place you under protective arrest .
well , yes , but I ... I can &apos;t afford to lose my job at the office , Mr. Spencer .
it &apos;s either your job or your life .
well , then , there are those articles that I &apos;m writing for the newspapers ...
you can write them up there .
but I can &apos;t .
why not ?
well , there &apos;s ...
there &apos;s my research .
research ? Yes .
well , what better place for research for the sort of stuff you &apos;re writing than prison ?
right , Mr. mayor ? right !
that &apos;s true . this isn &apos;t a question of choice , Mr. Jones .
this is a grave emergency .
that &apos;s true . that &apos;s right , your honor .
well , do you ... I &apos;d like to go home first , if you don &apos;t mind .
what for ?
I &apos;d like to pack a bag , sir .
certainly . certainly .
Boyle and Howe will take you home .
well , if you don &apos;t mind , I &apos;d much rather ... Now , there &apos;s nothing to worry about , Mr. Jones .
it &apos;s only for a short while . mannion is practically in our hands .
we &apos;ve got a pretty good idea where he is .
you have ?
Yes , we have ! you mean that you ...
all right , boys !
take Mr. Jones home . Yes , sir .
well , thank you very kindly , gentlemen . well , thank heavens that &apos;s over .
I think I &apos;ll go up with ya .
no , no , no , no , no , please .
why not ? what &apos;s a matter ?
now , I &apos;d rather you didn &apos;t .
I get it .
a dame ?
Yes .
you know , I got a hunch .
I got a hunch that 25 grand is gonna be caught by none other than detective sergeant Boyle .
here &apos;s your gun , Mr. mannion .
what &apos;d you pick up this gun for ?
why didn &apos;t you plug me when you had the chance ? you were asleep .
you can &apos;t shoot somebody who &apos;s sleeping .
why not ?
I &apos;d have done it if I &apos;d have been in your place . I &apos;ll tell you why you didn &apos;t do it .
you &apos;re afraid of me .
you &apos;re afraid of me , asleep or awake !
who is it ?
the police . they don &apos;t know you &apos;re here .
they &apos;re waiting for me .
for you ?
what for ?
they want to send me to prison so I &apos;ll be out of the way .
I see . well , they told me I had no choice in the matter .
I had to go whether I wanted to or not .
get over and wave to &apos; em .
hurry up !
tell &apos; em you &apos;ll be right down . I &apos;ll be right down .
hurry up and pack your grip .
I don &apos;t want them dicks coming up here .
what &apos;s the interest on 25 grand at six percent ?
no , you can &apos;t get six percent anymore .
you &apos;re lucky to get five percent .
five percent ... 12.50 a year ...
that &apos;s not bad . Hey , what &apos;s he doin &apos; up there ?
Packin &apos; a trunk ? say , you don &apos;t suppose he &apos;s tryin &apos; any funny business , do ya ?
Nuh , what &apos;s the percentage ?
you know , maybe I should have gone up with him at that , dame or no dame .
now , what kept you up there ?
I was just comin &apos; up after ya .
well , sorry .
well , jonesy , when we get you safe up there in prison , it &apos;ll be a cinch to get mannion !
say ... I &apos;d like to stop on the way and phone , if you don &apos;t mind .
okay , we &apos;ll stop someplace .
I &apos;m on my way to the prison now .
a couple of dicks are taking me up there .
what ? well , slugs Martin is up there , ain &apos;t he ?
that &apos;s what I &apos;ve been waiting for , isn &apos;t it ?
okay . now , you guys get a hold of Jones and hold him .
we &apos;ll take care of him later .
the boss just give us the ring and told us to come up here .
time to get into your clothes , buddy . well Mr. mannion took my clothes ...
haven &apos;t you got another suit ?
I have a gray , two-button ...
well , get into that !
Yes , I will .
right away , sir . could I offer you a cup of tea ?
go on , get dressed , will ya ?
Washington sent me down here to clean this thing up , and I &apos;m going to do it .
I tell you , the key to the whole situation is Jones .
did you read that article ?
why , yes .
it &apos;s about mannion &apos;s prison break . Jones says that mannion had one of the guards fixed .
that &apos;s right .
did you know that ? no .
did you ?
no ! no one knew it except me and a couple of the men in my department .
and we kept it a secret !
now , how did Jones know it , is what I want to know .
it might have been a stab in the dark .
is that so ?
read the article . it &apos;s written as if Jones had been an eye-witness to the break !
worse than that , as if he took part in it .
now , look here , Mr. Russell , surely , you don &apos;t think ...
I don &apos;t think anything ! there &apos;s something funny going on here .
and I want to talk to Jones .
get him down here right away .
certainly .
there you are . we &apos;re having trouble with slugs Martin .
he don &apos;t want to wear the prison outfit . why should he ? he &apos;s not a prisoner here .
here &apos;s here on his own volition . well , he looks kinda funny runnin &apos; around the yard in his own clothes .
he &apos;d look funny anywhere .
Hello ?
Yes , yes , Mr. Spencer . I &apos;ll send Jones to town right away .
okay .
where &apos;s Jones ?
in the visiting &apos; room , talkin &apos; to a friend of his .
a goofy-lookin &apos; guy by the name of seaver . get Jones up here right away .
okay , chief .
and I brought you something myself .
what &apos;s that ?
the McIntyre account ! Oh , yeah , yeah .
I know . sure . as long as you &apos;re on the payroll , you might as well do a little work .
goodness knows , you haven &apos;t been doing much work at the office lately , have you ?
well , you see , they &apos;ve been keeping ... Warden wants to see you right away , Mr. Jones .
fine . well , I &apos;ll be back and collect all these things .
that &apos;s mighty swell of the gang .
you give &apos; em ... I &apos;ll be ...
Jones has changed .
Mr. Jones ... There &apos;s something hot downtown .
I just got a call from the district attorney .
Yes , sir . you &apos;re to take the next train .
that &apos;s 2 : 30 . I &apos;ve arranged for one of the guards
to take you down to the station in an automobile . Yes , sir . be at the prison gate at two o &apos;clock sharp .
Yes .
wait a minute .
I don &apos;t know .
get out .
Hello , Mr. Martin .
well , now , don &apos;t make that mistake again .
I &apos;m Jones . Arthur Ferguson Jones .
you remember me ?
Hello .
Hello . Hey , I &apos;ve been trying to see you ever since I came here .
what about ?
you know , I &apos;ve been writing articles about him for one of them papers .
Oh , yeah ?
and I understand you &apos;re a very good friend of his .
who said I was ? I never had any use for that coked-up rat !
say , listen , that guy has double-crossed his own mother !
boy !
come on , let &apos;s take a little stroll where we can be by ourselves ?
you know , mannion don &apos;t mean a thing without the mob around him .
get him by himself and he &apos;s as yellow as they make &apos; em .
is that so ? Yeah , he was off on me because I had his number .
he knew he was slated for the skids .
and he was a dirty , double-crossin &apos; rat . he should have been rubbed out long ago .
he was nothin &apos; but a skunk . he crossed everybody that ever strung with him .
I &apos;d like to meet him face to face . I &apos;d skid him . I &apos;d just like to watch the yellow come right up .
why , the louse ...
better hurry up , Mr. Jones .
so long .
so long . so long .
I &apos;ll be seeing ya .
Oh , Jones ! the warden just told me that you were going into town .
and he said it would be all right if the guard gave me a lift to the station .
well , that &apos;s swell .
what more do you want ?
you had the guy in your car , didn &apos;t ya ? but we didn &apos;t know it was him , chief . how could we ?
he even had Jones &apos; clothes on ! that &apos;s right !
alibi ! you had a chance of a lifetime , and mannion made a sucker out of you !
and Howe !
Yeah , and you said if you ever got mannion back to prison again , he &apos;d rot before he ever got out !
well , you had him ! and you let him walk out !
I still don &apos;t think it was mannion .
no ? well , then who killed slugs Martin and the guard ?
maybe it was mannion .
but you can &apos;t pass the buck to me , Spencer .
you sent him up as Jones !
Yeah . good afternoon .
good afternoon . I &apos;m the man who identified mannion in the first place , when he was Jones .
I &apos;ve been working on the case ever since .
and I have a theory ... Who is it ? the same guy who &apos;s been calling me up all week !
I can &apos;t get him out of my hair !
Mr. carpenter . Mr. Spencer , where &apos;s seaver ?
who the devil &apos;s seaver ?
my office manager ! he went to the prison to see Jones . and he hasn &apos;t been heard of since !
well , don &apos;t ask me !
ask the warden ! D.A. , I called to see that Clark girl this morning , see ?
she wasn &apos;t home last night .
well , what of it ?
she &apos;s missing too ! Miss Clark !
seaver !
where &apos;s Jones ?
I tell you , boss , this town &apos;s gettin &apos; too hot for us . let &apos;s get goin &apos; while the goin &apos;s good .
there ain &apos;t a chance . they got every road covered .
what are you gonna do ?
hang around here until they come and get us ? leave it to me , will ya ?
I haven &apos;t steered you wrong yet , have I ?
I know , but ...
now , just a minute . there &apos;s only one chance of our getting &apos; out of here .
that &apos;s if they stop lookin &apos; for mannion .
Yeah ? but who says they &apos;re gonna stop ?
say , if you was a copper and you found mannion dead , you &apos;d stop lookin &apos; for him , wouldn &apos;t you ?
Hey !
Yeah . who &apos;s gonna croak you ?
Hey , you ain &apos;t thinkin &apos; of bumpin &apos; yourself off .
who , me ?
bring that guy Jones in here .
come on , jonesy .
thank you .
just easy .
just easy , please .
you mugs better beat it out of here . I &apos;m goin &apos; into a knack that &apos;s liable to break your hearts .
I &apos;m very much obliged to you , gentlemen .
come on . come on .
come in .
sit down , jonesy .
jonesy ...
I got good news for you .
I &apos;m letting you go . I &apos;m sorry about dragging &apos; you down here , but I had to get into that prison just because slugs Martin was there .
he ain &apos;t there anymore . he ain &apos;t anywheres .
I &apos;m gonna try and I am out of town tonight .
they &apos;ll probably get me .
but not alive . maybe the next story you &apos;ll write about me will be all about how I was croaked .
I hope not , sir .
you can help me , jonesy .
how ? it &apos;s gonna be the last favor I &apos;m ever gonna ask of you .
I want you to take this money down to the first national bank and put it in the safety deposit vault .
and then when I &apos;m croaked , I want you to take the money out and deliver it to my mother .
you &apos;ll find her name and address in this envelope .
I &apos;d do this myself only ...
one of the guards up at the prison
Nicked me in the head when I beat it out of there .
you know , this wound would be a dead give-away .
will you do it for me , jonesy ?
well ... Couldn &apos;t you get one of your own men to do this for you ?
one of my men ?
which one ? why , there ain &apos;t a one of them in there that I can trust !
my mother would never get this dough !
and that &apos;s the one thing I &apos;m trying to take care of before it &apos;s too late .
Yes , but ...
but how could I do it ?
I &apos;d be recognized as soon as I stepped out on the street . I &apos;d never reach the bank .
that &apos;s smart of you .
but I figured that out too , myself .
you can put on a disguise . say , I done it lots of times when I pulled jobs .
here .
stick on this mustache . go on , now !
where do you want me to put ...
put it on !
how &apos;s it feel ?
Tickles a little .
you &apos;ll get used to it . there , there &apos;s a mirror over there . go on .
my ... my goodness .
it ... it does make a difference , doesn &apos;t it ?
why , certainly ! say , you &apos;d never be known in a million years .
you got a poke ?
a poke ? Yeah , a pocketbook .
Oh , yes , sir .
Mr. mannion ,
I don &apos;t like to refuse you anything , but ...
you &apos;re not going to refuse me .
why , think of the old lady .
she &apos;s alone and helpless . have you got a mother ?
no , sir .
Yes , but I ... I &apos;ve got an aunt Agatha in Bridgeport .
I &apos;m terribly worried about her . she &apos;s disappeared someplace .
well , aunts ain &apos;t the same as mothers .
what do you say , buddy ?
Yes , sir .
now , don &apos;t forget . first national bank . and be sure to get there before it closes .
say , you better hurry up . there isn &apos;t much time left .
come on , shove off !
gee , boss , you were great . you almost fooled me .
never mind .
never mind .
look here ... Get to a phone right away . call up the police .
Yeah , tell them you &apos;re one of slugs martin &apos;s men , sore about me knockin &apos; him off , so you &apos;re tipping &apos; them off that mannion is on his way to the first national bank to pull a stick-up single-handed .
tell them he &apos;s got a mustache on .
you know , the same disguise I had on for the Palmers trust bank in Denver .
I got it .
well ...
that &apos;s that . the minute Jones is bunked , the bars are down . and that &apos;s all we need .
Hey ! what are you doin &apos; now ?
I &apos;m goin &apos; down to Gert &apos;s .
now ?
but , listen ... Shut up , will ya ? she &apos;s only down the street .
I &apos;ll be back in an hour . I know , boss , but with jonesy on the spot , we &apos;ve gotta take a lamming out of town ...
are you the manager ? Yes .
killer mannion &apos;s gonna stick up this bank at closing time .
killer mannion ?
Yeah , we &apos;re taking charge .
now , we don &apos;t want anybody hurt . get all your clerks and the people downstairs out of sight . hurry up .
Yes , sir .
all right . pay attention , everybody now ! get downstairs , quick as you can !
now , you men , take those coats off and leave them here !
boys , get rid of those coats ...
now , get down there . stay down there ...
go on downstairs !
Yes , on your way . on your way . get down there .
get that hat off there !
what &apos;s the matter with you ? take all those ... Take that hat off !
you Mcgillicutty , what are you doin &apos; ? you think you &apos;re tryin ... Get over there to that window .
go on , get down here .
keep those cannons straight on the door . don &apos;t let anybody by . nobody !
take that hat off , you fat head !
first national bank ! quick !
everything &apos;s all set , Mac .
but don &apos;t you think you better have a couple of men planted outside of that door ? no .
if mannion spotted any of us outside , he &apos;s liable to start shooting .
now , get back to your places !
doorman !
Yes .
you say you have a night bell outside ?
Yes , sir .
fine .
the minute you spot mannion , ring it ! Yes , sir .
and don &apos;t be afraid . we &apos;re right behind you .
what &apos;s the hurry ? where &apos;s the fire ? what &apos;s your name ?
why , my ... My name is ... O &apos;Connor .
Mike O &apos;Connor .
license 2698 . here .
never mind . I &apos;ll walk .
remember , when he comes through that door , shoot and shoot to kill . have you got your men placed ?
down there , out of sight . out of sight . get your hats down there ...
and the minute he comes through that door , let him have it , boys !
he ain &apos;t showed up yet . fine .
get back there . stay at that door . do you want to get killed ?
no , sir .
Hey , you ... Where do you think you &apos;re goin &apos; ? get back here !
I &apos;m sorry , officer .
I &apos;ve got to get across the street . I &apos;ve got to get to the first national bank .
well , you wait for the signal .
Hey , mister , please ! you can &apos;t go in there . the bank &apos;s done closed for the day .
go on .
watch it ! watch it !
shoot to kill !
Hey , is the bank still open ?
Yes , sir . thank you .
that &apos;s funny .
I must have forgotten it .
I guess I left it on the table .
well , I &apos;ll have to go back for it .
he done gone . he &apos;s gettin &apos; away .
come on , men !
that &apos;s the way we &apos;re gonna do it . we &apos;re gonna put it up to the boss straight .
if he don &apos;t want to go with us , we &apos;ll take it on the I am without him . that &apos;s right .
he can hang around here all he wants . but not me .
me neither .
there he is now .
remember , fellas . we stand pat . okay .
what &apos;s the news , boss ? have the cops knocked off Jones yet ? it &apos;s time you showed up , boss .
we was just thinkin &apos; of leavin &apos; . Yeah . we oughta get goin &apos; .
this is the way we figure it .
it &apos;s a great idea having the cops knock off Jones , but now that it &apos;s over ...
we wanna leave !
- This town is gettin &apos; too hot for us . - I &apos;ll get the car !
the boys don &apos;t like the idea of hanging around here , just on account of Gert .
if you &apos;ve gotta have a dame , we can take the Clark girl along .
that Clark dame &apos;s okay .
but the other two , they &apos;re a pain in the neck .
seaver &apos;s all right .
but that aunt Agatha , she &apos;s a holy terror . she almost talked me to death !
Jones is comin &apos; back !
somethin &apos; must &apos;ve gone wrong ! what &apos;s that boob coming here for ?
what do we do now , boss ?
should we let him in ?
Yeah , let him in .
should we plug him ?
Yeah , plug him .
it &apos;s more humane this way . sure .
all right ? Yeah , all right .
all right , get him in there !
go on ! give me a hand !
get back in there !
go on , scram , you ...

and look right into these cameras .
now , quiet , boys .
okay . how about it , jonesy ?
do you need a slug of whiskey ?
I should say not .
corny , who do you think you &apos;re talking to ?
if the attorneys don &apos;t know who the heir is , who does ?
come on . I &apos;ve done you a lot of favours .
who &apos;s getting the Semple dough ?
you &apos;re asking the wrong guy . I &apos;m only a press agent .
- Newspaperman ?
- Wants to know the heir .
- Hang up .
- Sorry , Mac , I can &apos;t ...
- Yeah , but I ain &apos;t the attorney . - Hang up !
Mr Cedar is , and I haven &apos;t seen him in two days .
- Cedar , we gotta deal with the papers .
- I &apos;m not interested .
but it &apos;s a great story .
somewhere a guy is walking into 20 million bucks .
my concern is to locate the lucky man .

Yes , sir .
Yes , indeedy . - Everyone knows Deeds .
- Must be a game he &apos;s playing .
we &apos;d like to get in touch with him .
- Who &apos;s that ?
- Deeds . who do you think ?
Oh , yes , Deeds . fine fellow . very democratic .
you won &apos;t have no trouble at all . talks to anybody .
we &apos;d better try somebody else .
next time he comes out , I &apos;ll straddle him while you ask him your questions .
morning , neighbours .
remember us , the fellows who were here a minute ago ?
Oh , yes , indeedy . I never forget a face .
listen , pop .
we &apos;ve come all the way from New York to look up Deeds .
it &apos;s important . it &apos;s very important .
don &apos;t get rough , neighbour . just ask .
then please pretend , for just one fleeting moment , that I &apos;m asking . - Where does he reside ?
- Who ?
Longfellow Deeds . where does he live ?
Oh , that &apos;s what you want . why didn &apos;t you say so in the first place ?
those fellows don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
I &apos;ll take you there .
if they &apos;d only explained to me , there &apos;d be no trouble .
Oh . will you come in , please , gentlemen ?
- Is Mr Deeds in ?
- No . he &apos;s at the park arranging a bazaar to raise money for the fire engine .
Mal , you knew he was in the park .
Yeah , but they wanted to see the house .
can &apos;t read their minds if they don &apos;t say what they want .
come in , please . - A cup of tea ?
- No , thank you .
sit down . sure I couldn &apos;t get you a glass of lemonade or something ?
that &apos;s very kind of you . - Are you related to him ?
- No , I &apos;m his housekeeper .
we &apos;d like to find out what he does for a living .
he and Jim Mason own the tallow works , but that &apos;s not how he makes his money . - He makes most of it from his poetry .
- He writes poetry ?
Oh , my goodness , yes . Longfellow &apos;s famous . he writes all those things on postcards .
you know , for Christmas and Easter and birthdays . sit down , please .
here &apos;s one . he got $ 25 for this one .
&quot; when you &apos;ve nowhere to turn and you &apos;re filled with doubt , &quot; don &apos;t stand in midstream hesitating ,
&quot; for you know that your mother &apos;s heart cries out , &quot; &apos; I &apos;m waiting , my boy , I &apos;m waiting . &apos;
isn &apos;t that beautiful ?
isn &apos;t it a lovely sentiment ? Yeah .
here he is now .
break it to him gently . he &apos;s liable to keel over from shock .
they &apos;ve been waiting a long while . - Who are they ?
- I don &apos;t know .
- Mr Longfellow Deeds ?
- Yes .
how do you do ?
I &apos;m John Cedar , of the New York firm of Cedar , Cedar , Cedar Budington .
Cedar , Cedar , Cedar Budington .
Budington must feel like an awful stranger .
- Mr Cornelius Cobb .
Mr Anderson . - How do you do ?
you gentlemen make yourselves comfortable . thank you .
new mouthpiece . been waitin &apos; two weeks for this .
kids keep swiping them all the time . they use &apos; em for bean shooters .
- What can I do for you ?
- Will you stay to lunch ?
- I &apos;d like to ask you a few questions .
- All right .
- Are you Joseph and Mary Deeds &apos; son ?
- Yes .
- Your parents living ? - Why , no .
well , Mr Deeds , does the name of Martin W. Semple mean anything to you ?
not much . he &apos;s my uncle , I think .
I never saw him . my mother &apos;s name was Semple .
well , he passed on . he was killed in a motor accident in Italy .
he was ?
gee , that &apos;s too bad . - If there &apos;s anything I can do ...
- I have good news for you , sir .
Mr Semple left a large fortune when he died . he left it all to you .
Deducting the taxes , it amounts to something in the neighbourhood of $ 20 million .
how about lunch ? are the gentlemen staying ?
of course .
she &apos;s got some fresh orange layer cake with that thick stuff on the top . sure .
they don &apos;t want to go to the hotel .
perhaps you didn &apos;t hear what I said , Mr Deeds .
the whole Semple fortune goes to you . $ 20 million .
Oh , yes , I heard you , all right . Twenty million is quite a lot .
- It &apos;ll do in a pinch .
- Yes , indeed .
I wonder why he left me all that money . I don &apos;t need it .
Mr Cobb is an ex-newspaperman . associated with your uncle for many years , as a buffer .
buffer ?
Yeah . a glorified doormat .
rich people need someone to keep away the crowds .
then there &apos;s the newspapers .
one must know when to seek publicity and when to avoid it .
Cedar , Cedar , Cedar Budington .
I can &apos;t think of a rhyme for &quot; Budington &quot; . why should you ?
whenever I run across a funny name , I like to find a rhyme .
don &apos;t you ? no .
- I &apos;ve got one for Cobb .
there once was a man named Cobb who kept Semple away from the mob .
came the turn of the tide , Semple died . now poor Cobb &apos;s out of a job .
- Sounds like two weeks &apos; notice to me .
I &apos;ve gotten the sackeroo in many ways , but never in rhyme .
- I don &apos;t mean that . I &apos;ll need your help .
- That &apos;s different , if it &apos;s just poetry .
- Are you married ? - Who , me ?
no .
no , he &apos;s too fussy for that . that &apos;s the matter with him .
there &apos;s lots of nice girls right here in Mandrake Falls ...
don &apos;t pay any attention to her .
he &apos;s got a lot of foolish notions about saving a lady in distress .
now , you keep out of this .
saving a lady in distress , eh ?
we all have dreams like that when we &apos;re young .
Incidentally , we &apos;d better get started .
- What for ?
- You &apos;re going to New York with us .
- When ?
- Four o &apos;clock .
I don &apos;t think we &apos;ve got any suitcases .
well , we could borrow a couple from Mrs Simpson .
she went to Niagara Falls last year .
I &apos;m nervous . I &apos;ve never been away from Mandrake Falls in my life .
- Like to see Grant &apos;s tomb .
- I understand . we &apos;ll meet you at the train at 4.00 .
congratulations , Mr Deeds . you &apos;re one of the richest men in the country .
see you later . - See you later , kid .
- Good day , sir .
did you hear what he said ?
know how much 20 million is ?
I don &apos;t care .
you sit there and eat your lunch . you haven &apos;t touched a thing .
I can &apos;t find him .
I looked everywhere . his house is locked up .
- A change of heart .
- He wasn &apos;t anxious to come . here comes the train .
- Look . - What ?
that tuba player .
well ... now I &apos;ve seen everything .
Goodbye , Mrs Meredith !
Goodbye , Jim !
Bye , Buddy !
gosh , I got a lot of friends .
- Have a drink ?
- No , thanks .
- Cigar ?
- No , thank you .
I wouldn &apos;t worry if I were you .
a large portion like this entails great responsibility , but you &apos;ll have help .
so don &apos;t worry . leave everything to me .
- I wasn &apos;t worried about that .
I was wondering where they &apos;re gonna get another tuba player for the band .
- Hello , John . where you been ?
- I &apos;ve been fishing .
good morning , Mr Cedar .
good morning .
where are they ?
- Waiting for you .
- Good morning , Mr Cedar . - Good morning .
- Morning .
- Hello , boys .
- Well , what &apos;s he like ?
we &apos;ve nothing to worry about . he &apos;s as naive as a child .
close that door .
- Get Mrs Cedar on the phone .
- What happened ?
the smartest thing I did was to make that trip .
- Did you get ?
- No , but I will get the power of attorney .
I asked him what he was going to do with the money .
know what he said ?
give it away .
- He must be a nitwit .
- You had the right hunch .
- John , we can &apos;t afford ... - I know , Budington .
we can &apos;t afford to have the books investigated .
- What if they fall into someone &apos;s hands ?
- It hasn &apos;t happened yet .
- Half a million dollars , my goodness ...
- Will you stop worrying !
I got Semple to turn it all over to us .
and who got power of attorney from him ?
all right , then I &apos;ll get it again .
take it easy . those books will never leave this office .
yokel . nothing but a yokel .
your uncle was mad leaving all that money to him .
you &apos;re as closely related to him as he is , and what did you get ?
- I say , what did you get ?
- Stop yelling . - He didn &apos;t like me . - I told you to be nice to him .
ten years we &apos;ve waited for him to kick off .
then we were gonna be on Easy Street . Yeah , on Easy Street .
- It &apos;s too late now . you &apos;re a nuisance .
- That &apos;s just what I &apos;m gonna be . until I get some of that money .
he &apos;s news ! every time he blows his nose , it &apos;s news .
a corn-fed bohunk falling into the Semple fortune is hot copy .
it &apos;s gotta be personal with an angle .
what does he think about ?
how does it feel to be a millionaire ?
what does he think of New York ?
is he smart , dumb ?
he &apos;s been here three days . what have you brought in ?
- A halfwit could &apos;ve done better .
- We tried ...
am I talking too loud or annoying anybody ?
you know Corny Cobb . he &apos;s keeping him under lock and key .
never mind . use what little brains you &apos;ve got . find out something for yourselves , you imbecilic stupes .
now get out of here before I really tell you what I think of you .
- What was that ?
- I said you had dirty plaster .
you too .
thought I could depend on you , but you &apos;re as bad as the rest .
- Look . I can do it . - What &apos;s gotten into you , Babe ?
you &apos;d blast this town open before letting Cobb get away with this .
he &apos;s not getting away with anything .
get some stuff on him and you can have ...
- A month &apos;s vacation ?
- With pay . with pay ?
leave four columns open on the front page tomorrow . I &apos;ll keep the whole front page open .
- What are you gonna do ?
the first time I ever had a suit made on purpose .
it &apos;s merely a suggestion , Mr Deeds , but if you give me power of attorney , we &apos;ll take care of everything .
everyone will try to sell you something .
there have been a lot of them already .
strange people .
salesmen , politicians , all want something .
haven &apos;t had a minute to see Grant &apos;s tomb .
your uncle didn &apos;t bother with that sort of thing .
he travelled , enjoyed himself . you should do the same thing .
besides wanting to be my lawyer , you want to handle my investments ?
- Yes . that is to say ...
- How much extra would it cost ?
- No extra charge .
- That &apos;s a lot of extra work .
but that &apos;s a service Cedar , Cedar , Cedar Budington usually donates .
Budington . I can &apos;t think of a rhyme for Budington yet .
the gentlemen from the opera are still waiting in the boardroom .
they &apos;re getting a trifle impatient .
I forgot .
what do they want ?
your uncle was chairman . they expect you to carry on .
I &apos;ll tell them to keep their shirts on and that you &apos;ll be down .
Oh , did you send that telegram to Jim Mason yet ?
Jim Mason ?
Oh , yeah , yeah . no , I didn &apos;t send it . I &apos;ve got it written out , though .
here it is . &quot; Arthur &apos;s been with the tallow works too long .
&quot; don &apos;t think we should fire him . Longfellow . &quot;
send it . I don &apos;t want him to fire Arthur .
sure , we don &apos;t want to fire Arthur .
Arthur was the last baby my father delivered .
you ought to give this matter some thought .
I mean about the power of attorney . Oh , yes , I will . I &apos;ll give it a lot of thought .
a fellow named Winslow here wanted to handle my business for nothing too .
puzzles me why they want to work for nothing .
it isn &apos;t natural . I &apos;d better think about it some more .
that &apos;s that .
you go to an awful lot of work to keep a fella warm .
- Yes , sir .
- A Mr Hallor to see you , sir . - Hallor ?
don &apos;t let him in .
- Why not ? who &apos;s he ?
a lawyer representing a woman . a claim against the estate .
if he has a claim , we &apos;d better see him . send him in .
he &apos;ll cause you a lot of trouble .
how can he make trouble for me ? I haven &apos;t done anything .
- I told you to take this up with me .
- I &apos;m tired of being pushed around . I don &apos;t care how important you are .
- I represent Mrs Semple .
- Mrs Semple ?
your uncle &apos;s common-law wife has a claim .
- Let the courts decide ...
- You wouldn &apos;t dare take this to court .
I &apos;ll leave it to you .
would any court not be in sympathy with a woman who gave up her best years for your uncle ?
- What kind of wife did you say ?
- Common-law wife .
- On top of that , there &apos;s a child .
- Child ? my uncle ?
Yes , sir .
that &apos;s awful . she should be taken care of .
glad to see you &apos;re willing to be reasonable .
as his wife , she should have the money . I don &apos;t want it ...
don &apos;t make any rash promises .
that opera mob is about to break into the mad song from Lucia .
I don &apos;t wanna keep them waiting .
- Very good , sir .
- I can &apos;t go down like this .
go along with me , Cobb . they &apos;re strangers to me .
- What about it , Mr Deeds ?
Oh . you &apos;ll excuse me , won &apos;t you ? I &apos;ll be right back .
do the opera people always come here for meetings ?
- Uh-huh . - Why &apos;s that ?
why do mice go where there &apos;s cheese ?
I &apos;m led to believe the young man &apos;s quite childish .
we &apos;ll have no difficulty getting the entire amount . - After all , it &apos;s only $ 180,000 .
- Excellent idea .
we &apos;re very fortunate the young man is so sympathetic toward music .
he plays the tuba in the town band .
- Here he comes .
the first order of business will be electing a new chairman of the board .
as a gesture toward the best friend that opera ever had , the late Mr Semple , it &apos;s fitting his nephew , Longfellow Deeds , be made our next chairman .
- I therefore nominate him . - Seconded .
- All those in favour ?
- Aye !
carried .
our congratulations , Mr Deeds .
- I &apos;m chairman ?
- Yes . you &apos;ve just been elected .
- I &apos;m chairman ! - Happy voyage .
right here , Mr Deeds .
- Next , the secretary &apos;s minutes . - Move we dispense with it .
- Seconded .
- All in favour ?
- Aye !
- I think they can be dispensed with .
- Now , the treasurer &apos;s report .
- Dispense with it . - Seconded .
- All in favour ?
quite right .
now , gentlemen , the next order of business ... Just a minute .
what does the chairman do ?
well , the chairman presides the meeting . that &apos;s what I thought .
but , if you don &apos;t mind , I &apos;m rather interested in the treasurer &apos;s report .
the treasurer reports a deficit of $ 180,000 for the current year .
a deficit ?
we lost that much ?
you see , Mr Deeds , the opera is not conducted for profit .
- It isn &apos;t ? what is it conducted for ?
- It &apos;s an artistic institution .
- We own an opera house , don &apos;t we ?
- We do .
- And we give shows ?
- We provide opera .
- But you charge ? you sell tickets ?
- Of course .
- And it doesn &apos;t pay ? - Impossible .
the opera has never paid .
well , we must give the wrong kind of shows . there isn &apos;t any wrong or right kind .
opera is opera .
I guess , but I wouldn &apos;t care to be head of a business that kept losing money .
that &apos;s not common sense .
Incidentally , where is the $ 180,000 coming from ?
well , we were rather expecting it to come from you . - Me ?
- Naturally .
excuse me , gentlemen . there &apos;s nothing natural about that .
fire engine !
gee , that was a pip ! we &apos;re gonna have one like that in Mandrake Falls soon , with a siren too .
where were we ?
the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business .
- Why not ?
- Because it just isn &apos;t a business .
maybe not to you , but it certainly is to me , if I have to make up a loss of $ 180,000 .
if it &apos;s losing that much , something &apos;s wrong .
maybe you charge too much , sell bad merchandise .
a lot of things .
you see , I expect to do a lot of good with that money , and I can &apos;t afford to put it into anything I don &apos;t look into .
that &apos;s my decision for the time being , gentlemen .
Goodbye , and thank you for making me chairman .
gentlemen , you &apos;ll find the smelling salts in the medicine chest .
sorry to keep you waiting .
those opera people are funny . they wanted me to put up $ 180,000 .
- What about it ?
- I turned them down , naturally .
- No , I mean about my client .
- Oh . we &apos;ll have to do something about her .
- Tails tonight , sir ?
- Tails ?
why , that &apos;s a monkey suit .
you want people to laugh at me ?
I &apos;ve never worn one .
Goodbye , and thank you , sir .
Goodbye . wants me to wear a monkey suit .
- We don &apos;t want to appear greedy . - Huh ?
- I say , we don &apos;t want to appear greedy .
- What are you doing ?
- Assisting you , sir .
I don &apos;t want anybody holding the ends of my pants .
get up from there .
imagine that . holding the ends of my pants .
Mrs Semple is entitled to one third of the estate .
- Don &apos;t ever get on your knees again .
- No , sir .
what &apos;d you say ?
Mrs Semple is entitled to one third of the estate .
one third ? that &apos;s about $ 7 million .
well , we didn &apos;t expect that much .
I can get her to settle for one million .
take up any settlement talk with my office .
I &apos;ll do no such thing .
there &apos;s only one place you &apos;re going , and that &apos;s out the door .
- You &apos;re making a mistake .
- Oh , no , I &apos;m not . I don &apos;t like your face .
besides , there &apos;s something fishy about settling for a million when you can get seven million .
I &apos;m surprised Mr Cedar , who &apos;s supposed to be smart , couldn &apos;t see through that .
now , wait a minute , buddy !
one nice thing about being rich , you ring a bell and things happen .
when the servant comes in , I &apos;ll ask him to show you to the door .
no use in getting tough . that &apos;ll get you nowhere . we &apos;ve got letters .
- Show Mr Hallor to the front door . - Yes , sir .
there isn &apos;t any wife , there aren &apos;t any letters , and you &apos;re a crook , so you &apos;d better watch your step .
I can &apos;t hold out any longer . - Lamb bites wolf . beautiful .
- It &apos;s only common sense .
I can &apos;t hold out any longer either . being your attorney will be very simple .
you &apos;re not my attorney yet , not till I find out what &apos;s on your mind .
get the books straightened out so I can have a look at &apos; em .
Yes , of course , if you wish . but you must be prepared . this will be daily routine .
if it becomes annoying , you let me know .
Goodbye , Mr Deeds .
Goodbye , sir .
even his hands are oily .
tonight , what would you like in the way of entertainment ?
entertainment ?
your uncle had a weakness for dark ones . tall and stately . how would you like yours ?
dark or fair ?
tall or short ?
fat or thin ?
tough or tender ?
- What are you talking about ?
- Women . ever heard of &apos; em ?
- Name your poison , and I &apos;ll supply it .
- Some other time , Cobb . ok .
you &apos;re the boss . when your blood begins to boil , yell out . I &apos;ll be seeing you .
- He talks about women like cattle .
- Every man to his taste , sir .
are all these stories I hear about my uncle true ?
well , sir , he sometimes had as many as 20 in the house at the same time .
- Twenty ?
what &apos;d he do with &apos; em ?
- That is something I never found out .
- Hey ! you going out ?
- Yes . isn &apos;t that all right ? no .
you never go out without telling us .
- Who are you ?
- We &apos;re your bodyguards .
Mr Cobb said stick to your tail .
that &apos;s very nice , but I don &apos;t want anybody sticking to my tail .
sorry , mister . orders is orders .
we get you up in the morning , put you to bed at night .
no matter what we see , we don &apos;t see nothin&apos;
- That &apos;s gonna be fun . - Some people like it .
- Will you do something for me first ?
- Sure . put that away , slug . at your service .
- Would you get my trunk out for me ? - Certainly .
with pleasure .
we &apos;re your bodyguards ! you can &apos;t do this !
there he is .
- That &apos;s him . - That &apos;s who ?
- Get your cameras , follow me . - What you gonna do ?
never mind . grab whatever you can get .
it &apos;s gonna be the same old thing . - That dame &apos;s nuts .
- Right .
you fainted .
Oh , did I ?
I &apos;m sorry . - Can I help you ?
- No , thank you . I &apos;ll be all right .
this is my house . I &apos;d like to ...
Oh , no , really , I &apos;ll be all right .
- What happened ?
- Well , I guess I walked too much . I &apos;ve been looking for a job all day .
I found one too . I start tomorrow . you &apos;ve been awfully kind .
Hey ! taxi !
Hey , Stu , follow that cab they just got into , will ya ? - Hurry up ! step on it !
- Come on , let &apos;s go !
feel better now ?
this tastes so good . I don &apos;t know how I can ever thank you .
tell me more about yourself .
well , I guess I &apos;ve told you almost everything there is to tell .
my folks live in a small town near Hartford .
I &apos;m down here alone trying to make a living .
I &apos;m really just a nobody .
Oh , that was so lovely . thank you .
you were a lady in distress , weren &apos;t you ?
- What ?
- Nothing .
waiter .
- Has anybody come in yet ? - Uh , no .
nobody important .
be sure and point them out to me .
I &apos;m a writer myself , you know .
I write poetry .
well ... you &apos;ve been having quite an exciting time , haven &apos;t you ?
with all these meetings , business deals , society people .
- Haven &apos;t you been having fun ?
- No . that is , I didn &apos;t until I met you . I like talking to you , though .
imagine my finding you right on my doorstep .
- Brookfield &apos;s just come in .
- Who ? the poet ?
where ?
over at that big round table . the one that looks like a poodle .
- Look , there &apos;s Brookfield , the poet .
- Really ?
pardon . Longfellow Deeds , who inherited the Semple fortune , wants to meet you . Oh , yes .
I read about him . he writes poetry on postcards .
invite him over . might get a couple of laughs .
- Getting rather dull around here .
- It &apos;s always dull here . - I &apos;ll get him .
- Good .
Mr Henneberry . Mr Morrow .
bill . this is Mr Deeds and his fiancée from Mandrake Falls .
how do you do , Mr Deeds ?
nice of you to ask us to come and sit with you .
back home we never get to meet famous people .
- Waiter , a little service here .
- Yes , a drink for Mr Deeds .
- I don &apos;t want it , thank you .
- All poets drink .
how do you go about writing your poems ?
we are very interested in one another &apos;s methods .
do you have to wait for an inspiration , or do you just dash it off ?
- Well , I ... - Morrow just dashes them off . Yeah .
that &apos;s what my publishers have been complaining about .
- Well , your readers don &apos;t complain .
- Oh . thanks .
how about you , Mr Deeds ?
well , I write mine on order .
the people I work for tell me what they want , and then I write it .
amazing !
why , that &apos;s true genius .
have you any peculiar characteristics when you &apos;re creating ?
- Well , I ... I play the tuba .
I &apos;ve been playing the harmonica for 40 years . didn &apos;t do me a bit of good .
you wouldn &apos;t have one in your pocket ?
what , a tuba ?
no , a postcard with one of your poems on it . - Oh , no .
- You don &apos;t carry a pocketful with you ? Oh , too bad .
I was hoping you &apos;d autograph one for me .
- I was too .
- Now , wait a minute , boys . perhaps Mr Deeds would recite one for us .
that &apos;s a very good idea .
nothing like a poet reciting his own stuff .
how about a Mother &apos;s Day poem ? exactly .
give us one that rings the great American heart . Yes . go ahead .
I get the idea . I know why I was invited here . to make fun of me .
- Oh , not at all .
- Don &apos;t be ridiculous . - Look , he &apos;s temperamental .
- What if I am ? what about it ?
it &apos;s easy to make fun of somebody if you don &apos;t care how much you hurt &apos; em .
your poems are swell , Mr Brookfield , but I &apos;m disappointed in you .
I must look funny to you , but if you went to Mandrake Falls you &apos;d look as funny , only nobody &apos;d laugh at you , because that wouldn &apos;t be good manners .
maybe postcard poems are comical , but people think they &apos;re good .
anyway , it &apos;s the best I can do .
so if you &apos;ll excuse me , we &apos;ll be leaving .
I guess I found out that all famous people aren &apos;t big people .
and if it weren &apos;t for Miss Dawson , I &apos;d bump your heads together .
Oh , I don &apos;t mind .
then I guess maybe I will .
Eureka !
step aside .
say , fella , you neglected me and I feel very put out .
look , sock it right there , will ya ? sock it hard .
- I &apos;ve got it off my chest .
- Oh , listen . the difference between them and me is I know when I &apos;ve been a skunk .
you take me to the nearest news-stand and I &apos;ll eat a pack of your postcards raw .
Oh , what a magnificent deflation of smugness !
pal , you &apos;ve added ten years to my life .
a poet with a straight left and a right hook ? delicious . delicious .
you &apos;re my guest from now on , for ever and a day , even unto eternity .
- Thanks , but we &apos;re going sightseeing .
- Fine . fine . swell .
listen , you hop aboard my magic carpet ... Thanks ...
I &apos;ll show you sights that you &apos;ve never seen before .
grant &apos;s tomb and the Statue of Liberty ?
you &apos;ll not only see those , but before the evening &apos;s through , you &apos;ll be leaning against the Tower of Pisa , mount Mount Everest .
I &apos;ll show you the pyramids and all the sphinxes .
pal , how would you like to go on a real old-fashioned binge ?
- Binge ?
- Yeah , I mean the real McCoy .
play saloon with me , and I &apos;ll introduce you to every wit , nitwit and halfwit in New York .
we &apos;ll go on a twister that &apos;ll make Omar the soused philosopher of Persia look like an anaemic on a goat &apos;s milk diet .
- That oughta be fun , huh ? - Fun ? say ...
listen , I &apos;ll take you on a bender that will live in your memory as a thing of beauty and a joy for ever .
boy ? boy , my headpiece ! O Tempora !
O Mores !
O Bacchus ! - Oh , you &apos;re drunk .
- Oh , you &apos;re right !
- If we go with him , we &apos;ll see things . - I guess we will .
&quot; &apos; I play the tuba to help me think . &apos;
&quot; a statement made by Longfellow Deeds , New York &apos;s new Cinderella Man ,
&quot; who last night proved that his late uncle from whom he inherited $ 20 million ,
&quot; was an amateur in the art of standing the town on its cauliflower ear . &quot;
&quot; Cinderella Man . &quot; that &apos;s sensational , Babe , sensational .
took some high-powered acting . - Did it ?
- I was the world &apos;s sweetest ingenue . is he really that big a sap ?
he &apos;s the original . there are no carbon copies of that one .
&quot; Cinderella Man . &quot; that &apos;ll stick to him for the rest of his life .
can you imagine Cobb &apos;s face when he reads this ?
if we sold tickets , we &apos;d make a fortune .
- How &apos;d you get the picture ?
- Had the boys follow us .
marvellous . &quot; at two this morning , Mr Deeds tied up traffic
&quot; while he fed a bagful of doughnuts to a horse .
&quot; when asked why , he replied ,
&quot; &apos; to see how many doughnuts the horse would eat before he asked for coffee . &apos;
beautiful ! what happened after that ?
I had to write the story .
he was so drunk he never missed me .
when are you gonna see him again ?
tonight , maybe . I &apos;ll phone him at noon .
my lunch hour ...
- I &apos;m a stenographer . Mary Dawson .
- You &apos;re a genius , Babe , a genius .
I moved into Mabel Dawson &apos;s apartment , in case Cobb might start looking around .
good . don &apos;t show your face here . I &apos;ll say you &apos;re on vacation .
no one &apos;ll know where the stories are coming from .
you can get an exclusive out of him every day .
we &apos;ll have the other papers crazy . - Babe , I could kiss ya !
- Oh , no . no . - Our deal was for a month &apos;s vacation .
- Sure . - With pay .
- You &apos;ll get it , Babe .
Mr Deeds . Mr Deeds , sir .
you really must get up . it &apos;s late .
- You &apos;re Walter , aren &apos;t you ?
- Yes , sir .
just wanted to make sure .
if you &apos;ll permit me to say so , sir , you were out on quite a bender last night .
bender ?
you &apos;re wrong , Walter .
we started out to a binge , but we never got to it .
Yes , sir .
- What &apos;s that ?
- A prairie oyster , sir . prairie oyster ?
Yes , sir .
it makes the head feel smaller .
- Has Miss Dawson called yet ?
- No Miss Dawson has called , sir .
she was the lady in distress . she wouldn &apos;t let me help her .
- Had a lot of pride . I like that . - Oh , I do too , sir .
I &apos;d better call her up and apologise . I don &apos;t remember taking her home .
I &apos;d venture , you don &apos;t remember much of what happened last night , sir .
what do you mean ?
I remember everything .
hand me my pants . I wrote her phone number on a piece of paper .
you have no pants , sir . you came home last night without them .
- I did what ?
- You came home without any clothes . you were in your shorts .
Yes , sir .
I couldn &apos;t walk around on the streets without any clothes .
I &apos;d be arrested .
- That &apos;s what the two policemen said .
- What two policemen ?
they brought you home .
they said you kept walking up and down the street shouting , &quot; Back to nature !
clothes are a blight on civilisation ! back to nature ! &quot;
listen , Walter , if a man named Morrow calls up , tell him I &apos;m not in .
he may be a great author , but ... I think he &apos;s crazy .
the man &apos;s crazy , Walter !
Yes , sir .
Oh , by the way , did you ?
- The knee .
- But how will I put on the slipper , sir ?
Yes , sir .
I beg pardon , sir , but did you ever find what you were looking for , sir ?
looking for ?
you kept searching my pockets last night , sir . you said you were looking for a rhyme for &quot; Budington &quot; .
- Better bring me some coffee . - Very good , sir .
I beg pardon . a telegram came for you , sir .
I &apos;ll get you some black coffee , sir .
did you see all this stuff in the paper ?
- Arthur wants to quit .
- Arthur ? who &apos;s Arthur ?
he &apos;s the shipping clerk at the tallow works . wants a $ 2 raise , or he &apos;ll quit .
what do I care ? did you see this stuff in the paper ?
how did it get in there ?
what did you do last night ?
what did you do to those bodyguards ?
said you locked them up .
- They insisted on following me .
- What do you think bodyguards are for ?
- What do they mean , &quot; Cinderella Man &quot; ?
- Are those stories true ?
&quot; Cinderella Man &quot; ?
they &apos;d call you anything if you gave &apos; em a chance .
they got you down as a sap .
- I &apos;ll punch this editor in the nose .
- No , you don &apos;t ! get this clear . Socking people in the nose is no solution for anything .
- Sometimes it &apos;s the only solution .
- Not editors . take my word for it .
- If they &apos;re gonna poke fun at me ...
- Listen , Longfellow .
you got brains , kid .
you &apos;ll do swell if you curb your homicidal instincts and keep your trap shut .
these newshounds are gunning for you .
- What about this &quot; Cinderella Man &quot; ?
- I &apos;ll take care of that , if you &apos;ll help me .
but I can &apos;t do anything if you go around talking to people .
will you promise me to be careful from now on ?
- Yes , I guess I &apos;ll have to .
if you feel the building rock , it &apos;ll be me , blasting into this editor .
Cobb &apos;s right . I mustn &apos;t talk to anybody .
- Miss Dawson on the phone , sir . - Who ? Miss Dawson ?
- Yes , sir . - Fine .
give me the phone , quick .
she &apos;s the only one I &apos;m gonna talk to .
- Awfully nice of you to show me around . - I enjoy it .
the aquarium was swell . if I lived in New York , I &apos;d go every day .
I bet you do .
I &apos;d like to , but I have a job to think of .
- You &apos;d better keep following that bus ! - Keep your shirt on !
- No pictures tonight .
- I oughta get him drunk again .
got any news ? I mean , has anything exciting been happening lately ?
sure . I met you .
what &apos;s happening about the opera ?
Oh , that . we had another meeting . I told &apos; em I &apos;d be chairman if ...
- I &apos;m chairman , you know .
- Yeah , I know .
I told &apos; em I &apos;d play along if they lowered prices , cut down expenses and broadcast .
what &apos;d they say ?
gee , you look pretty tonight .
- What &apos;d they say ?
- Huh ? Oh . they said I was crazy , that I wanted to run it like a grocery store .
- What are they going to do ?
- Do you always wear your hair like that ?
isn &apos;t it a scream ?
&quot; Cinderella Man . &quot; the dope .
I &apos;d like to get my hooks into that guy .
someone &apos;s probably taking him for plenty .
if they were men , I &apos;d knock their heads together .
- Have you seen the papers ?
that &apos;s what I like about you . you think about a man &apos;s feelings .
I &apos;d like to punch the fella in the nose that &apos;s writing that stuff .
&quot; Cinderella Man . &quot;
pretty soon everybody &apos;ll be calling me Cinderella Man .
would you like to walk the rest of the way ? it &apos;s so nice out . - Yes .
- Yeah , let &apos;s .
Hey , wise guys , he &apos;s getting off .
come on , pull up to the kerb !
Oh , come on . don &apos;t you want to see it ?
well , feast your eyes . grant &apos;s tomb .
is that it ?
Hey , beetle puss . the tomb .
well , there you are . grant &apos;s tomb . I hope you &apos;re not disappointed .
- It &apos;s wonderful .
- To most people it &apos;s an awful let-down .
I say , to most people it &apos;s a washout .
that depends on what they see . - And what do you see ?
Oh , I see a small Ohio farm boy becoming a great soldier .
I see thousands of marching men .
I see General Lee , with a broken heart , surrendering .
I can see the beginning of a new nation , like Abraham Lincoln said .
and I can see that Ohio boy being inaugurated as president .
things like that can only happen in a country like America .
excuse me .
sorry , Mr Hopper . Mr Cedar won &apos;t answer his phone .
what &apos;s going on ?
the three C &apos;s and B have been in there over an hour .
I don &apos;t want to be critical , but ...
I know . we haven &apos;t got power of attorney .
- But you said ...
- I can &apos;t strangle him , can I ?
it &apos;s ridiculous for us to worry about him .
look at these articles . &quot; Cinderella Man . &quot;
- He &apos;s carrying on like a idiot .
- Exactly what I said ...
who cares ?
- Yeah ?
- Mr and Mrs Semple are waiting .
- Let &apos; em wait .
- They &apos;ve been in every day this week .
- Who ?
- Relatives of old man Semple .
they keep insisting they should have some nuisance value . - Nuisance value ?
- If not for Deeds , they &apos;d be rich .
nuisance value ... Maybe they have . maybe they have , maybe they have ...
Mr and Mrs Semple , please . how do you do ?
I &apos;m so sorry to have kept you waiting .
what was my secretary thinking , keeping you waiting this long ?
- Will you have a cigar , Mr Semple ? - Thanks .
- There &apos;s Times Square .
- You can almost spit on it . why don &apos;t you try ?
it &apos;s breezy up here .
you &apos;re worried about those articles they &apos;re writing about you ?
Oh , I &apos;m not worrying any more . they &apos;ll go on writing &apos; em until they get tired .
you don &apos;t believe all that stuff , do you ?
- They just do it to sell the newspapers .
- Yeah , I guess so .
what puzzles me is why people seem to get so much pleasure out of hurting each other .
why don &apos;t they try liking each other once in a while ?
shall we go ?
here &apos;s a nice place .
Yeah . anyway , there aren &apos;t any photographers around .
you said something to me when you first met me I &apos;ve thought about a great deal .
- What &apos;s that ?
- You said I was a lady in distress .
Oh , that . - What did you mean by that ?
- Nothing .
have you got a ?
are you engaged or anything ?
- No . are you ?
- No .
- You don &apos;t go out with girls very much .
- I haven &apos;t . - Why not ?
- Oh , I don &apos;t know .
you must &apos;ve met a lot of society girls .
don &apos;t you like them ?
I haven &apos;t met anybody here that I like particularly .
they all seem to have St Vitus &apos; Dance . except you , of course .
people here are funny .
they work so hard at living , they forget how to live .
last night , after I left you ,
I was walking along , looking at the tall buildings , and I got to thinkin &apos; about what Thoreau said .
&quot; they created a lot of grand palaces here ,
&quot; but they forgot to create the noblemen to put in them . &quot;
I &apos;d rather have Mandrake Falls .
- I &apos;m from a small town too , you know . - Really ?
- Probably as small as Mandrake Falls .
- What do you know about that !
it &apos;s a beautiful little town , too .
Grove poplar trees right along main street . always smells as if it just had a bath .
- I &apos;ve often thought about going back .
- You have ?
Oh , yes .
I used to have a lot of fun there . I loved going fishing with my father .
you know , that &apos;s funny . he was a lot like you , my father was . he talked like you , too .
sometimes he let me hold the line while he smoked .
we &apos;d just sit there for hours .
after a while , for no reason , I &apos;d go over , kiss him , sit in his lap .
he never said very much , but once I remember him saying ,
&quot; no matter what happens , honey , don &apos;t complain . &quot;
he sounds like a person well worth knowing .
- He played in the town band , too . - He did ?
- I play the tuba . - Yeah , I know .
- What did he play ?
- Drums .
he taught me to play some . - He did ?
- Mm-hmm . I can do Swanee River . - Would you like to hear me ?
- Oh , I suppose you could do better . - Sure . I can sing Humoresque .
I bet you don &apos;t even know how it goes . sure .
you sing it over again , and I &apos;ll do Humoresque with it .
- You better be good .
- Do they want to make it a quartet ?
- Ready ?
- Yeah .
fire engines .
fire engine ! I wanna see how they do it .
wait for me .
looks like the evening won &apos;t be wasted .
Hello . what do you want ?
Captain Deeds , fire volunteer , Mandrake Falls .
Hi , Cap . boys , meet the captain .
- What &apos;s the matter , hon ?
- Nothing .
what &apos;s up , Babe ?
something &apos;s eatin &apos; you . no , it &apos;s nothing .
my unfailing instinct tells me something &apos;s wrong .
don &apos;t be ridiculous .
you haven &apos;t gotten very far . that &apos;s where you were an hour ago .
let &apos;s go down to Joe &apos;s . the gang &apos;s waitin&apos;
I can &apos;t write it . I don &apos;t know what &apos;s the matter with me .
Hello ? Yeah , she &apos;s here . who wants her ?
who ?
Oh , yes . Yes , just a moment .
it &apos;s him .
Whatchamacallit . the Cinderella Man .
the Cinderella Man .
couldn &apos;t sleep . wanted to talk to you . do you mind ?
no , not at all . I couldn &apos;t sleep either .
I wanted to thank you again for going out with me .
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;d do without you . you &apos;ve made up for all the fakes I &apos;ve met .
well , that &apos;s very nice . thank you .
you know what I &apos;ve been doin &apos; since I got home ?
I &apos;ve been workin &apos; on a poem . it &apos;s about you .
sometimes it &apos;s kind of hard for me to say things , so I write &apos; em .
I &apos;d like to read it sometime .
maybe I &apos;ll have it finished next time I see you .
gosh , that &apos;s swell , Mary . Goodnight .
Goodnight .
Mabel , that guy &apos;s either the dumbest imbecile in the world or the grandest thing alive .
- I &apos;m crucifying him .
- People have been crucified before .
- Why do we have to do it ?
- You started out to be a success .
- Then what ?
- Search me . ask the Gypsies .
here &apos;s a guy that &apos;s wholesome and fresh . to us he looks like a freak .
do you know what he told me tonight ?
when he gets married he wants to carry his bride over the threshold .
the guy &apos;s barmy . is he ?
Yeah , I thought so too . I tried to laugh , but it stuck in my throat .
cut it out , will ya ? you &apos;ll get me thinking about Charlie again .
he &apos;s got goodness , Mabel . do you know what that is ?
of course you don &apos;t . we &apos;ve forgotten .
we &apos;re too busy being smart alecs . too busy in a crazy competition for nothing .
I beg pardon , sir .
- Madame Pomponi is on the telephone . - Who ?
she says everything is all set for the reception .
don &apos;t come in when I &apos;m playing .
- She &apos;s on the telephone .
- Get out . the evil finger &apos;s on you . - The finger , sir ?
stop !
- Did you hear that ?
why , that &apos;s an echo , sir .
- You try it .
louder .
- You try it .
louder .
you try it .
all together .
let that be a lesson to you .
go back to your rooms , both of you .
Hello , darling . - So good of you to come . - Madame Pomponi .
- I &apos;m so happy to have you here .
- I &apos;m dying to see the Cinderella Man . - Shh . he may hear you .
- Even if he did , he wouldn &apos;t understand .
- I hear he believes in Santa Claus .
will he be Santa Claus ? that &apos;s what I wonder .
- Slippers ready for the Cinderella Man ?
- Think he &apos;ll go for that ?
with $ 20 million , he doesn &apos;t have to have looks .
he won &apos;t have it long with that Pomponi woman hanging around .
my dears , I hear that he can &apos;t think unless he plays his tuba .
- You &apos;re a fool , Babe .
- I just couldn &apos;t stand seeing him again .
running away is no solution .
what &apos;ll I say if he calls up ?
tell him I had to leave suddenly . got a job in China , someplace .
- You &apos;re acting like a schoolgirl .
- What else can I do ?
keeping this up &apos;s no good . he &apos;ll find out sometime .
at least I can save him that .
- Where is everybody ? - Come on , Babe .
the artillery &apos;s ready .
it &apos;s those two sore spots again .
- Should &apos;ve been down to the office .
- Mac threw Cobb out . - Boy , was he burning .
- No , you don &apos;t .
one drink , and then we &apos;re ready to shoo .
- We &apos;re not going out . - You have a date with him .
it &apos;s off . he &apos;s having a party at his house .
- What &apos;s the matter with her ?
- You wouldn &apos;t know . - Run along . peddle your little tin-types .
- What ? throwing us out of here is getting to be a regular habit .
is Mary Dawson here ?
I &apos;m Longfellow Deeds .
Yes . of course . Longfellow Deeds .
you &apos;re Mabel , her sister , aren &apos;t you ?
Yes . Yes . of course .
Yes , I &apos;ve been her sister a long time .
- Is she home ? - Yeah .
what ?
- Is Mary home ?
- Oh , Mary .
Yes , of course .
I don &apos;t know whether she &apos;s home or not .
I &apos;ll see . there she is .
- Hello . - Hello , Mary .
I waited in the park over an hour . I thought maybe you &apos;d forgotten .
I didn &apos;t think you &apos;d come , with the party .
I wouldn &apos;t let them stop me from seeing you , so I threw them out .
- You threw them out ?
- You mean , by the neck ?
sure . they got on my nerves , so I threw them out .
that &apos;ll be in the papers tomorrow , give them something else to laugh at .
I don &apos;t mind , though . I had a lot of fun doing it .
- Like to go for a walk ?
- Yeah , if it isn &apos;t too late .
I &apos;ll get my hat .
nice day out ... Nice night , wasn &apos;t it ...
isn &apos;t it ? Yes .
lovely . we &apos;ve had a lot of nice weather lately .
Yeah . it &apos;d be a nice night to go for a walk , don &apos;t you think ?
Yeah , I think it &apos;d be a swell night to go for a walk .
- Ready ?
- Gosh . - She looks better every time I see her . - Thank you .
Goodnight . I won &apos;t keep her out late .
thank you so much . Goodnight .
- My foot &apos;s asleep .
- No , you don &apos;t . - Listen , she told us ... - No more photographs .
glad you wanted to take a walk , Mary , &apos; cause I wanted to talk to you .
let &apos;s just walk , hmm ?
all right .
Mary , I &apos;m going home . are you ? when ?
- A day or so , I think .
- I don &apos;t blame you .
a man ought to know where he fits in . I don &apos;t fit in here .
I had an idea I could do something with the money , but they kept me so busy I haven &apos;t figured it out .
I guess I &apos;ll wait till I get back home .
do you mind if I talk to you , Mary ?
you don &apos;t have to pay any attention .
no , I don &apos;t mind .
all my life I &apos;ve wanted somebody to talk to .
back in Mandrake Falls , I used to always talk to a girl .
- A girl ?
- Only an imaginary one .
I used to hike a lot , and I &apos;d always take this girl with me , so I could talk to her .
I &apos;d show her my pet trees and things .
it sounds kind of silly , but we had a lot of fun doing it . she was beautiful .
I haven &apos;t married , &apos; cause I &apos;ve been kind of waiting .
you know , my mother and father were a great couple .
I thought I might have the same kind of luck .
I &apos;ve always hoped that someday that imaginary girl would turn out to be real .
- Well , here we are again . - Yes , here we are again . - Goodnight .
- Goodnight .
Mary , I ... - Excuse me .
- Goodbye , darling .
don &apos;t let anybody hurt you again , ever .
they can &apos;t anyway . you &apos;re much too real .
you go back to Mandrake Falls . it &apos;s where you belong . Goodbye .
Mary .
you know the poem I told you about ?
it &apos;s finished . - Would you like to read it ?
it &apos;s to you .
- Yes . of course .
you don &apos;t have to say anything , Mary . you can tell me tomorrow what you think .
&quot; I tramped the Earth with hopeless feet , &quot; searching in vain for a glimpse of you .
&quot; then heaven thrust you at my very feet ,
&quot; a lovely angel , too lovely to woo .
&quot; my dream has been answered , but my life &apos;s just as bleak .
&quot; I &apos;m handcuffed and speechless in your presence divine .
&quot; for my heart longs to cry out . if it only could speak .
&quot; I love you , my angel . be mine . be mine . &quot;
you don &apos;t have to say anything now . I &apos;ll wait till tomorrow to hear from you .
stop it , Babe . stop it . you &apos;re quitting ?
you might as well tell me I &apos;m quitting . what &apos;s bothering you ?
last night he proposed to me . proposed to you ?
he asked you to marry him ? - Yes .
- Why , Babe !
that &apos;s terrific !
&quot; Cinderella Man woos mystery girl . who is the ? &quot;
- Print that and I &apos;ll blow your place up .
- Sorry , Babe . I just got carried away .
that &apos;s too bad . that would &apos;ve made a swell story . so , he proposed to you ?
what a twist . you set out to nail him , and ...
Yeah . funny twist , isn &apos;t it ?
you haven &apos;t gone and fallen for that mug , have you ?
well , I &apos;ll be .
that &apos;s tough , Babe . - What are you going to do ?
- I &apos;m going to tell him the truth .
tell him you &apos;re Babe Bennett ?
tell him you &apos;ve been making a stooge out of him ?
I &apos;m having lunch with him today . he expects an answer . - It &apos;s going to be pretty .
- You &apos;re crazy . you can &apos;t do that .
he &apos;ll probably kick me right down the stairs . I hope he does .
I &apos;ll put you on another job . you need never see him again .
that &apos;s the rub .
Oh , it &apos;s as bad as that ?
telling him &apos;s the long shot . I &apos;m going to take it .
well , it was fun while it lasted , Mac . I &apos;ll clean out my desk .
- How &apos;s it going ?
- Quite all right , sir .
- Gold ?
- Yes , sir .
- Fourteen karat .
- Yes , sir .
- Is that the best you got ?
- Yes , sir .
flowers are too high . I won &apos;t be able to see her .
- Get a smaller bowl .
- A smaller bowl . - Yes , sir .
a smaller bowl . - Did you get that stuff ?
- Stuff , sir ?
- That goo that tastes like soap .
Yes , sir . here it is . the pâté de foie gras , sir .
fine . have a lot of it , &apos; cause she likes it .
now you got the idea .
that &apos;s fine . sit over there , will you ? - Me , sir ?
- Yeah .
- You &apos;re too tall .
slink lower , will you ? - Yes .
more .
now forward .
how is this , sir ? - Perfect ...
perfect .
- I wish you luck , sir .
thank you . now , don &apos;t touch a thing .
Walter ? - Walter , where are you ?
- What is it , sir ?
anything happened ?
&quot; anything happened &quot; ?
I got to get dressed .
- But she isn &apos;t due for an hour , sir .
- What &apos;s an hour ? time flies .
- My tie ? - Yes , very good , sir .
just as I suspected , wise guy .
I don &apos;t mind you making a sap out of yourself , but not out of me .
will you tell the gentleman I &apos;m not in ?
Mary Dawson , hmm ?
Mary Dawson , my eye . she took you for a sleigh ride New York will laugh about for years .
she &apos;s the slickest two-timing , double-crossing ...
- What are you talking about ?
- Go ahead . sock away . and then try to laugh this off .
she &apos;s the star reporter on the Mail .
every time you opened your kisser , you gave her another story .
she slapped that moniker on you : Cinderella Man .
- She &apos;s a double dose of cyanide .
- Shut up !
babe , I can &apos;t let you quit now . are you going through with this ?
this is for you . all the head waiters in town .
you can buy scandal from them at reasonable prices .
I &apos;ve seen them get in a rut like you before , but they come back .
Hello ? Yes ? just a minute .
it &apos;s for you .
soon you &apos;ll get the itch so bad , you &apos;ll work for nothing .
babe Bennett ?
just a minute .
- Hello , Mary ? - Hello , darling .
have you been writing those articles about me ?
why , I was just leaving . I &apos;ll be up there in a minute .
look ... Yes , I did , but I was just coming up to explain .
listen , darling . wait a minute . please .
I beg pardon , sir .
should I serve the wine with the squab , sir ?
I beg pardon , sir ?
if I knew you were going to take it so hard , I would &apos;ve kept my mouth shut . sorry .
pack my things , Walter . I &apos;m going home .
Yes , sir .
you shouldn &apos;t be running away like this . what &apos;ll happen to the estate ?
they can have the estate .
nobody &apos;s going to kick me out .
let me go ! I want to see that guy !
let me go ! I want to see him !
let me go ! there he is . I wanna look at him .
I wanted to see what kind of a man you were .
a man that spends thousands on a party , while people around him were hungry .
the Cinderella Man ?
did you think how many families could be fed on what you pay to get on the front pages ?
let him alone .
if you know what &apos;s good for you , let me get this off my chest .
how did you feel feeding doughnuts to a horse ? got a kick out of it ? got a big laugh ?
ever think of feeding doughnuts to human beings ? no !
- Shall I call the police , sir ?
what do you want ?
that &apos;s all that &apos;s worrying you : what do I want ?
a chance to feed a wife and kids .
I &apos;m a farmer . a job . - That &apos;s what I want .
- A farmer ?
you &apos;re a moocher . I wouldn &apos;t believe you on a stack of Bibles .
you &apos;re a moocher like all the rest , so get out .
sure , everybody &apos;s a moocher to you .
a mongrel dog eating out of a garbage pail is a moocher to you .
- This won &apos;t do you any good .
- Stay where you are !
you &apos;re about to get some more publicity , Mr Deeds . you &apos;re about to get on the front page again .
see how you &apos;re going to like it this time .
what good &apos;s your money when you &apos;re six feet under ? never thought of that .
all you ever thought of was pinching pennies , you money-grabber .
you never gave a thought to those starving people in the bread lines not knowing when their next meal was , not able to feed their wife and kids .
I &apos;m glad I didn &apos;t hurt nobody . excuse me .
crazy . you get all kinds of crazy ideas .
sorry . I didn &apos;t know what I was doing .
losing your farm after 20 years &apos; work .
seeing your kids go hungry .

Mr Deeds , the boys here wanted me to say a little something .
they just wanted me to say that ... Well , they wanted me to say that we think you &apos;re swell . and that &apos;s no baloney .
- Say something more . - Give me a chance , fellows .
we &apos;re all down and out .
a fellow like you comes along , it gives us hope . they just wanted me to say that I &apos;ve ...
that &apos;s him . - Are you Longfellow Deeds ?
- Yes .
sheriff &apos;s office . we got a warrant to take you into custody .
- A what ?
- A warrant for your arrest .
- What &apos;s up ? what do you wonks want ?
- I have an insanity warrant to execute .
- Insanity ?
who says he &apos;s insane ?
- A relative of the late Martin Semple .
the charges are that Mr Deeds is insane and incapable of handling the estate .
somebody got panic-stricken ? where are you going to take him ?
- County Hospital .
- It &apos;s only temporary . a hearing will follow immediately .
that &apos;s fine . just because I wanna give this money to people who need it , they think I &apos;m crazy .
that &apos;s marvellous . that makes everything complete .
- Let &apos;s go . - Wait . we &apos;re going to get a lawyer .
- I &apos;ll call Cedar . - Don &apos;t bother .
I &apos;m from Mr Cedar &apos;s office . he represents the complainant .
- Let &apos;s go . we &apos;re wasting time .
- All right . but get your hands off me .
come on . get back . step back .
everybody in town has been here to see him . Yes , sir . I will .
Goodbye . sorry , lady . it &apos;s you again .
- Please . I &apos;ve got to see him .
- Listen , he don &apos;t want to see nobody .
- Will you just give him my name ?
- Listen .
there isn &apos;t a thing the matter with that guy , till I mention your name .
what are you going to do ? sit back and let them railroad you ?
it &apos;s as pretty a frame-up as ever hit this rotten town .
if you &apos;d just let me get you a lawyer .
you can &apos;t walk into that court without being ready to protect yourself . Cedar &apos;s too smart .
with the talent he &apos;s lined up against you , you &apos;ll cook .
listen , I know just how you feel . a blonde in Syracuse put me through the same paces .
I came out with a sour puss , but full of fight .
come on . you don &apos;t want to lay down now .
they &apos;re trying to prove you &apos;re nuts .
they &apos;ll shove you in the bug house .
the moment they accused you of it , they had you half licked .
go on . sit down , won &apos;t you ? Yes .
so long , Mr Cobb .
corny , listen , I &apos;ve got to see him .
I &apos;ve got to talk to him .
haven &apos;t you done enough damage already ?
somebody &apos;s got to help him . he hasn &apos;t a chance against Cedar .
I &apos;ve got Mac lined up and the paper &apos;s behind him .
I can get Livingston .
with a lawyer like that , he &apos;s a chance .
you &apos;re wasting your time . he doesn &apos;t want lawyers . he &apos;s so low , he doesn &apos;t want help .
you can take a bow for that .
as swell a guy as ever hit this town and you crucified him for some headlines .
you &apos;ve done your bit . now stay out of his way .
Cedar wants to make a settlement .
here &apos;s your chance to get out of the whole mess .
rise , please .
supreme Court , State of New York , now in session . the Honourable Judge May presiding .
the court wishes to warn those present it will tolerate no disturbances .
regarding the sanity hearing of Longfellow Deeds ...
you represented by counsel , Mr Deeds ?
I understand you have no counsel , and you have no intention of defending any of these charges .
now , if you wish to change your mind , the hearing can be postponed .
crazy .
proceed .
in the interest of my client , relative of the late Martin W Semple , we cannot permit the fortune to be dissipated by a person whose incompetency and abnormality we shall prove beyond doubt .
I have a series of articles written by a newspaperwoman , who witnessed his conduct since he came to New York .
she tells how , in mid-conversation , he &apos;d suddenly begin playing his tuba .
she tells of his attack on several eminent writers for no reason .
I , myself , unable to keep pace with his mental quirks and fearful of assault , turned down an opportunity to represent him as his attorney .
this newspaperwoman , who we &apos;ve subpoenaed to testify , tells how he held up traffic for an hour feeding doughnuts to a poor horse .
we have photographs to substantiate this episode , and others of him jumping about a fire engine .
this scarcely sounds like the action of a man in whom the disposition of $ 20 million may safely be entrusted .
the writer of these articles , whose integrity in the newspaper world is unquestioned , held him in such contempt that she quite aptly named him the Cinderella Man .
we have witnesses from Mandrake Falls , who will tell of his conduct throughout his lifetime , proving that his derangement is neither a recent nor a temporary one .
we have others who will tell of his unusual behaviour , when he invited great leaders in music to his home and then proceeded to forcibly eject them .
only recently , when he was in the County Hospital for observation , he not only refused to be examined by these state psychiatrists , but he actually made a violent attack upon them .
in these times , with the country incapacitated by economic ailments and in danger with an undercurrent of social unrest , the promulgation of such a weird , fantastic and impractical plan , as contemplated by the defendant , is capable of fomenting a disturbance from which we may not recover .
it is our duty to stop it .
our government is aware of its difficulties .
it can pull itself out of its economic rut without the assistance of Mr Deeds .
his attempted action must therefore be attributed to a diseased mind , afflicted with hallucinations of grandeur and obsessed with an insane desire to become a public benefactor .
your Honour , we would like to call our first witness , Louise &quot; Babe &quot; Bennett .
Miss Bennett , please .
raise your right hand , please .
do you swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth ? - I do .
- State your right name .
- Louise Bennett .
Miss Bennett , are you employed by the Morning Mail ?
- I ask you direct your attention to me .
- This is ridiculous . - Answer the question .
- The hearing &apos;s ridiculous . - That man &apos;s no more insane than you .
- Outrageous !
it &apos;s obviously a frame-up . they &apos;re trying to railroad this man for money .
another outburst and I shall hold you in contempt .
we are not interested in your opinion . you are to here to testify .
sit down and answer questions .
proceed . thank you .
are you employed by the Mail ?
no .
you &apos;re under oath .
are you employed by the Mail ? no , I resigned last week .
Prior to that time , were you employed by the Mail ?
- Yes .
- You followed the activities of Deeds ?
- Yes .
- Did you subsequently write about him ?
- Yes .
- Are these the articles ?
- Yes .
- Were you present ? - Yes .
- Are they true ?
they did take place ?
- They just make him look silly .
- You saw them ?
- That &apos;s all .
- It isn &apos;t all .
I &apos;d like to explain ...
- I submit these articles as evidence .
- Let go ! what kind of hearing is this ?
are you trying to persecute the man ?
somebody &apos;s got to defend him !
- Please .
- I &apos;ve a right to be heard . I &apos;ve attended dozens of cases like this .
they &apos;re conducted without any formality . anybody can be heard .
my opinion &apos;s as good as these quacks&apos;
I know him better than they do
one more utterance from you and I shall place you under arrest !
I &apos;m willing to hear anything you say , but it must be done in an orderly fashion .
when you &apos;ve learned respect , you may return .
until then , go back to your seat and calm down .
this way , Miss .
order in the court .
Mr Deeds , have you anything to say in defence of these articles ?
Mr Deeds ?
- Mark these Exhibit &quot; A &quot; for the plaintiff .
they &apos;re rather timid , Your Honour , and wish to be together .
I &apos;ll only have one testify .
- Get on with it .
- What is your name , please ?
- Jane Faulkner . this is my sister Amy .
- Yes . Amy .
I &apos;ll direct my questions to you , Miss Jane . you may answer for both .
do you know the defendant ?
Yes . of course we know him .
how long have you known him ?
- Since he was born . - Yes .
Elsie Taggart was the midwife .
- He was a seven-months baby .
- Thank you . that &apos;s fine .
do you see him very often ?
- Most every day . - Sometimes twice .
- Must we have the echo ?
- Suppose you just answer , Miss Jane .
will you tell the court what everybody at home thinks of Longfellow Deeds ?
- They think he &apos;s pixilated . - Yes . pixilated .
- He &apos;s what ?
- What was that you said he was ?
- Pixilated .
- That &apos;s rather a strange word to us . - Can you tell us what it means ?
- Perhaps I can explain .
&quot; pixilated &quot; is an early-American expression from the word &quot; pixies &quot; , meaning &quot; elves &quot; .
they &apos;d say , &quot; The pixies had got him &quot; , as we &apos;d nowadays say a man is &quot; barmy &quot; .
is that correct ?
why does everyone think he &apos;s pixilated ? does he do peculiar things ?
he walks in the rain without his hat and talks to himself .
- Sometimes he whistles . - And sings .
anything else ?
- He gave Chuck Dillon a thumping . - Blacked his eye .
- And why ?
- For no reason , I guess . he always does it .
we run into the house when we see him coming .
never can tell what he &apos;s going to do .
- He sure is pixilated . - Yes . he &apos;s pixilated , all right .
thank you , ladies . that &apos;s all .
they kept hollering , &quot; Back to nature ! &quot;
I thought they looked harmless enough , so I took them home .
I never thought he was cracked .
I &apos;m a waiter . he kept pressing me to point out the celebrities .
I &apos;m coming out of the kitchen minutes later , he &apos;s mopping up the floors with them .
I never figured he was looking for trouble .
he threw us out bodily , but bodily !
we was hired as his bodyguards , see ?
but he locks us in a room , see ?
if that gets around in our profession , we get the bird .
so I says to my partner , &quot; Let &apos;s quit this guy .
I &apos;m very fond of Clarissa . she &apos;s a nice horse .
and when he started feeding her doughnuts ,
I yelled down to him , &quot; Mind what you &apos;re doing down there . &quot;
I wouldn &apos;t mind , sir , but Clara won &apos;t eat nothin &apos; but doughnuts now .
if the court pleases , I call upon Dr Emil Von Hallor , if he &apos;ll give us his opinion .
he is the eminent psychiatrist , a great authority on the subject .
he &apos;s here on a lecture tour and has volunteered his services .
- Dr Von Hallor . - Dr Von Hallor .
do you swear the testimony you give before this court shall be the truth and nothing but the truth ?
- Name ?
- Emil Von Hallor . take the stand .
Dr Von Hallor , would you tell the court what your opinion is of this case ?
this is purely a case of manic depression .
a case of this kind , patients sometimes go on for years before being detected .
you remember , in my last book , there were some very fine examples , especially the young nobleman .
Yes , Dr Von Hallor . very interesting .
it reminds me very much of this one .
it takes so long to detect them , because their mood changes so often and so quickly .
now , Your Honour , may I show you ? may I use the chart ?
by all means .
below here , they are extremely depressed , melancholy , impossible to live with and often become violent .
from this mood , the manic depressive might gradually change until they reach this state .
here is lucidity . here they are normal , as normal as you or I .
Assuming , of course , that we are normal .
then the mood changes again until they reach this state , a state of highest exultation .
here , everything is fine .
here , the world is beautiful . here , they are so elated ...
how to express it ?
... they would give you the shirts off their backs .
how would you say that applied to Mr Deeds &apos; case ?
the symptoms are obvious .
when he was here , on top of the wave , he felt nothing but kindliness and warmth for his fellow man .
he wanted to have them around him , so he decided to give a big reception .
but in the meantime , his mood has changed . he &apos;s now at the bottom of the wave : depressed , melancholy .
so when his guests arrive , he throws them out .
they are now his imaginary enemies .
other instances of high elations are when he plays his tuba , when he writes his poetry , when he chases fire engines in a desire to help humanity .
this is contrasted with his present mood , which is so low that even the instinct for self-preservation is lacking .
your Honour , this is decidedly a case of manic depression .
thank you very much , Doctor .
your Honour , we rest .
are you going to let them get away with it ?
he &apos;s sunk .
Mr Deeds ... Before the court arrives at a decision , isn &apos;t there anything you wish to say ?
come on . don &apos;t be a sap .
Mr Deeds ...
in view of the extensive testimony , your continued silence , and on the recommendation of the doctors , the court considers it advisable , for your own safety , that you be committed to an institution as prescribed by law .
you need medical attention , Mr Deeds .
perhaps in a little while ... No !
wait a minute .
you can &apos;t do it .
you &apos;ve got to make him talk .
- I object !
- Please . I know how horrible I &apos;ve been .
no matter what happens , do this for me .
- Please .
- You said I could speak .
you said I could have my say .
please let me take the witness chair .
he must be made to defend himself before you decide .
- Take the stand . - Thank you .
- She has no bearing on the case .
- Let her speak .
I know why he won &apos;t defend himself .
he &apos;s been hurt .
he &apos;s been hurt by everybody , principally by me .
he &apos;s been the victim of every crook in town .
the newspapers made him a target for their feeble humour .
I was smarter than the rest . I got closer so I could laugh louder .
why shouldn &apos;t he keep quiet ?
every time he said anything , it was twisted around . he can thank me for it .
I handed them a laugh .
a fitting climax to my sense of humour .
- This is preposterous .
- I wrote those articles . I was going to get a raise , a month &apos;s vacation .
but I stopped writing them when I found out what he was all about .
he could never fit in with our distorted viewpoint , because he &apos;s honest and sincere and good .
if that man &apos;s crazy , the rest of us belong in strait-jackets !
- This is absurd .
she &apos;s in love with him .
- What &apos;s that got to do with it ?
- You are , aren &apos;t you ?
- Yes ! her testimony &apos;s of no value . why shouldn &apos;t she defend him ?
typical womanhood .
protect the weak .
nobody dislikes the boy . I have a fond affection for him .
- But that doesn &apos;t mean to say ...
- I can verify what Miss Bennett said .
she told me what a swell fellow this man was .
anything Babe Bennett says is OK with me .
if you &apos;ve anything to say , take the stand .
I &apos;ve already said it . I just thought I &apos;d like to get my two cents in .
don &apos;t be a sucker . speak your piece .
- I &apos;ve got a couple of cents . - Sit down .
- I &apos;ve been with him since he came here . - Sit down !
there will be no interruptions .
- How about us , Mr Deeds ?
- What about us , Mr Deeds ?
- Order !
- Don &apos;t leave us out in the cold !
they &apos;re trying to frame you .
- Stop this .
in the interest of Mr Deeds , I have tolerated a great deal of informality .
but if there is one more outburst , I shall have the courtroom cleared .
- Your Honour ? - Yes ?
I &apos;d like to get in my two cents &apos; worth .
take the stand .
proceed .
I don &apos;t know where to begin . there has been so much said about me that ...
about my playing the tuba . it seems like a lot of fuss has been made about that .
if a man &apos;s crazy just because he plays the tuba , somebody &apos;d better look into it , because there are a lot of tuba players running around .
I don &apos;t see any harm in it .
I play mine whenever I want to concentrate .
that may sound funny to some people , but everybody does something silly when thinking .
for instance ... The judge here is an &quot; O &quot; filler .
- A what ?
- An &quot; O &quot; filler . you fill in all the spaces in the O &apos;s with your pencil .
that may make you look a little crazy , just sitting around , filling in O &apos;s , but I don &apos;t see anything wrong , &apos; cause that helps you think .
- Other people are doodlers . - Doodlers ?
that &apos;s a name for people who make foolish designs on paper when thinking .
almost everybody &apos;s a doodler . did you ever see a scratch pad in a telephone booth ?
people draw the most idiotic pictures when they &apos;re thinking .
Dr Von Hallor here could probably think up a long name for it , because he doodles all the time .
thank you .
this is a piece of paper he was scribbling on .
one minute it looks like a chimpanzee .
the next minute it looks like a picture of Mr Cedar .
you look at it .
Exhibit &quot; A &quot; for the defence .
looks kind of stupid . but that &apos;s all right .
if Dr Von Hallor has to doodle to help him think , that &apos;s his business .
everybody does something different .
some people are ear pullers . some are nail biters .
that Mr Semple over there is a nose twitcher .
the lady next to him is a knuckle cracker .
so you see , everybody does silly things to help them think .
well , I play the tuba . - Nice work , toots !
- Order in this court !
this is becoming farcical .
I demand Mr Deeds confine himself to facts .
let him explain his wanderings in his underclothes , his feeding doughnuts to horses .
proceed .
Mr Cedar &apos;s right . those things do look kind of bad , don &apos;t they ?
but to tell you the truth , Your Honour , I don &apos;t remember them .
I guess they happened , because I don &apos;t think a policeman would lie , but I was drunk .
it was the first time I was ever drunk .
it &apos;s probably happened to you some time . I mean , when you were younger .
it &apos;s likely to happen to anybody .
just the other morning , I read about Mr Cedar &apos;s own son , how he got drunk and insisted on driving a taxicab while the driver sat inside .
isn &apos;t that so ?
isn &apos;t that so ?
- Your Honour , I object . - Proceed .
now , about the Faulkner sisters .
that &apos;s funny , Mr Cedar going to Mandrake Falls to bring them here .
- Do you mind if I talk to them ?
Jane , who owns the house you live in ?
- Why , you own it , Longfellow . - Yes , you own it .
- Do you pay any rent ?
- No , we don &apos;t pay any rent .
good heavens , no . - We never pay you rent .
- Are you happy there ? - Oh , yes . - Yes , indeed .
now , Jane , a little while ago you said I was pixilated .
do you still think so ?
why , you &apos;ve always been pixilated , Longfellow . - Always . - That &apos;s fine .
I guess maybe I am .
now , tell me something , Jane . who else in Mandrake Falls is pixilated ?
why , everybody in Mandrake Falls is pixilated , except us .
now , just one more question .
you see the judge here . he &apos;s a nice man , isn &apos;t he ?
- Do you think he &apos;s pixilated ?
- Yes . Yes , indeed .
you haven &apos;t yet touched upon the most important point :
this rather fantastic idea of yours to give away your entire fortune . it is , to say the least , most uncommon .
Yes , I was getting to that , Your Honour .
suppose you were living in a small town , getting along fine , and suddenly somebody dropped $ 20 million in your lap .
suppose you discover all that money was messing up your life , was bringing vultures around your neck , making you lose faith .
you &apos;d be worried .
you &apos;d feel that you had a hot potato in your hand , and you &apos;d want to drop it .
Dr Von Hallor here would say you were riding on those bottom waves , because you wanted to drop something burning your fingers .
if this man carries out his plan , repercussions will rock the foundation of our entire government .
please , Mr Cedar .
proceed .
personally , I don &apos;t know what Mr Cedar is raving about .
no matter what system of government we have , there &apos;ll always be leaders and always be followers .
like the road in front of my house , on a steep hill . every day , I watch the cars climbing up .
some go lickety-split up that hill , some have to shift into second .
some sputter and shake and slip back to the bottom again .
same cars , same gasoline , yet some make it and some don &apos;t .
I say the fellows who can make the hill should stop and help those who can &apos;t .
that &apos;s all I &apos;m trying to do , help fellows who can &apos;t make the hill .
what does Mr Cedar expect me to do ?
give it to people who don &apos;t need it ?
if you don &apos;t mind , I &apos;ll ride on those top waves for a minute .
all you fellows up there , all those who applied for a farm , stand up .
see them ?
they &apos;re the ones I &apos;m trying to help .
Mr Cedar and Mr Semple don &apos;t need anything . they &apos;ve got plenty .
it &apos;s like I see one fellow in a rowboat who &apos;s tired of rowing and wants a free ride and another who &apos;s drowning .
who would you expect me to rescue ? Mr Cedar , who wants a free ride ? or those men who are drowning ?
any 10-year-old child will give you the answer to that .
thank you . sit down .
now , my plan was very simple .
give each family 10 acres , a horse , a cow and some seed , and if they worked the farm for three years , it &apos;s theirs .
if that &apos;s crazy , I ought to be sent to an institution , but I don &apos;t think it is , and Mr Cedar doesn &apos;t either .
before the hearing , he offered to call everything off if I made a settlement .
he wouldn &apos;t think I was crazy if he got paid off .
it &apos;s a lie growing in his warped imagination .
I never heard anything so stupid in my life .
it &apos;s an insult to our intelligence to listen to such ravings .
- You will permit Mr Deeds to finish .
- But , Your Honour ...
- Anything else , Mr Deeds ?
Yes . there is one more thing I &apos;d like to get off my chest .
- Proceed . - Thank you , Your Honour .
order !
remain seated and come to order . the court is again in session .
before the court announces its decision , I want to warn all who are here that the police have orders to arrest anyone creating a disturbance .
Mr Deeds , there has been a great deal of damaging testimony against you .
your behaviour , to say the least , has been most strange .
but in the opinion of the court , you are not only sane , you are the sanest man that ever walked into this courtroom .
you nose twitcher .
I knew it , I knew it . you ...
- He &apos;s still pixilated . - He sure is .

I am a person
I am similar to you as a person who contains blood , body and soul
are you Song Danping ?
quite right , I am the famous actress Song Danping 1 0 years ago
but 1 3 year ago fleed from home along Yangtze River
and fought for the freedom but sacrificed himself , this revolution martyr Jin Zijian

this faithful revolution warrior
he did not die
friend , young friend
you are youth with hot liver , courage and hope
I have waited livelong ten years
until today I meet you
you are the ideal one in my mind
now
I want to tell everything of myself to you completely
this is me 1 3 year agos
who fleed from home in Yangtze River
at that time ...
at that time , because the environment is too dangerous
so I have to hide in a clandestine place
at that time , although I only have ten years old
but , I have the courage
I have a decision to fight for freedom
so , I have already been the leader of several thousand revolution youths
in my whole life , also at that time
it can be regarded as my golden age
so , why did you call Song Danping again ?
I heard that Song Danping has already died
you ... are you exactly a person ?
could you let me see your true character ?
no , I can &apos;t
you listen to me continuously
three years later ,
the information outside wanted to list me gradually depressed
I changed my name
and joined a new play regiment
and come to perform here
this is me 1 0 years ago
once I performed a world-famous play here
Red-blooded
who would like to be the slave ?

we are willing to pay any price for the universal love , equal and freedom
even our lives

livelong ten years
I cover up in this grave by myself
just as a corpse
I can see her every evening
I imperceptibly drop down the tears
look
she lives in ...
although I can see her , I can &apos;t near her
I have no alternative
have to use my singing to comfort her
while everu round lonely moonlit night
she always stands to hear here
since ten years , she has already become accustomed to it
Mr. Song , so
why do not think a good way
or ...
or it &apos;s to call the person to tell her , say that you didn &apos;t die
so she is certain ...
no
absolutely can &apos;t
if she knows that I didn &apos;t die

good , good
I , I want to ask you to comfort her for me once
what ?
don &apos;t be odd , don &apos;t be odd
you see , you see
I ...
how can I still near her ?
since ten years
there was not one day that I didn &apos;t hope to meet the friend within an ideal
on the other hand
I help other people to success with the knowledage I owned
at the same time
also hope that the other people can substitute me to do the affair that I did not finish
my friend in the ideal is you , you !
friend , you promised me
as long as learn my voice , my euphonic
go to speak with her a few words
she will believe that I come perhaps of
Lo , she is still there

this world also can &apos;t be in need of you
Danping
why did not you use the bright eyes to look at me ?
why not talk ?
I am often in those lonely evening
heard your bright singing
gave me very big consolation
but , why till today you just walk to me ?
you ... did you forget me ?
Danping
he forgot me
Ms. Li , you do not doubt
please fresh your suffered and wounded feeling
don &apos;t be so negative for a Danping
Demolished your whole life
gave up the responsibility as a people
you can &apos;t be regarded as knowing the real understanding Song Danping like this
you also can &apos;t be regarded as loving Song Danping
younger sisiter Xia , you still remember
before how did we encounter somebody else &apos;s breakage
now , how should we go to fight with them ?
Danping , Danping failed
but , but you ...
you ...
do you still have your power
do you not say ?
we want to fight for our freedom
we want to get our brightness
so you shouldn &apos;t give up
we want to put the taste on the whole mankind
don &apos;t only for ourselves
but ...
I ...
I feel fearful
I can &apos;t be without you , I can &apos;t leave you
younger sisiter Xia , do not fear , be braver
Danping all follows you at any time
younger sisiter Xia , see

young lady , how much years did not hear you to call me mother
do you recover now ?
young lady , do you recover ?
you look , my hand
yesterday evening , I still held hands with him
I really hope that he will come again
I still need to see him
I still need to see him
young lady
Liu Die , if there is a pair of lovers
they can not reach any aspect of their purposes
do you think that he would be foolish ?
how only is foolish ?
if I meet such an affair
I certainly will suicide
Xiaoou , forever we will not separate
we didn &apos;t be baffled forever
see the situation of this actors of one troupe , it &apos;s probably unreliable
according to old Zhang &apos;s words who guards the garden today
their business is too bad
so the money that they owe us
we go to ask them to pay us
otherwise their getup boxs are not valuable
I also thought of it
we say with cashier
settle an account with them hurriedly
here the mental state and taste of the audience is really hard to catch
the drama of Liu Die can also draw large audience
but she played not several days got sick again
the taste of the audience
audience
fortunately the disease of green disc is unimportant
probably will recover soon
income in the park for now
at most can maintain five days
now let &apos;s decide so
if Liu Dieof tomorrow can &apos;t still take place
so we go on to play three days
if business is not good still , we leave right away
Mr. Song
Mr. Song , we ... we will distinguish soon
don &apos;t be pessimism , friend
the situation of your play regiment I know completely
so , I have already thought a way for you to rectify
Remediable way ?
Yes
friend , I thanks a lot for your help to me
now
it &apos;s time for me to help you
Mr. Song , is what is the row exactly ?
you think me in this decade
did you distress only for woman here ?
no , in no case
I have ever done many works
work ?
Yes , yes
I wrote very many manuscripts
Contend for the manuscript that strives for the freedom and the liberation
I have already brought for you
Red-blooded
this is my successful work ten years ago
I have already reorganized over its content

I want to consolate you , I want to make you comfortable and happy
so , I sought a
more more hopeful close relative to accompany you
but now

Mr. Song
no , don &apos;t blame you
friend , it is me too reckless
you are a person who had the lover
wish you successful

but , Mr. Song , when shall we see again ?
don &apos;t know , don &apos;t know
it &apos;s tomorrow perhaps
is a lasting future perhaps
lasting future
forever will ...
Miss Shen , do you know where Liudie goes ?
you ask you lover Miss Liudie ?
do not you know ?
the landlord here , Mr. Tang Jun likes her
call her there
you really have the face
Mr. Tang
ask you to forgive , respect our personality please !
Mr. Tang , this time I came
it &apos;s to explain my meaning clearly to you
please do not misunderstand
hereafter don &apos;t treat me like this again
joke , respect personality
do you say that I has a liking for you ,
is not it to respect your personality ?
Oh , Miss

thank you , Mr. Tang
I have already had a depending
who do you depend on ?
I depend ...
I depend on that art with blood , spirit and construct successfully
Ah , art
where did you go ?
I went to Tang Jun &apos;s
that what did you still come back for ?
you do not misunderstand , I was forced to
against will , do you still want to beguile me ?
Xiao Ou , you know me only
you do not know the reason that I go to
really it &apos;s because person whom they sent
forced me to go , I have no way
if I refused to see him determinedly
they said that Tang Jun will use a cruelty means to deal with you
because personal relation of us they knew already
so it is all for you that I went to see him
as well , now still my whole body is innocent
that Tang Jun was on the contrary taught by me
you , why you ...
who believe your that bogus words
you basically have no possibility to explain
Xiao Ou , Xiao Ou

you , you go out

very fierce
because pity you , just follow and near you
you rise the shelf on the contrary
today let you know my severe
help
come on , come on , tortures of everything all come
the enemy of the public , you
see , see whose judgment day will arrive
see whose judgment day will arrive
Xiao Ou , he ... he is Tang Jun
the surname Tang , you did any bad thing with a few filthy lucres
in past ten years
is it enough that the people were squeeze and devastated by you ?
you think others all do not know your actions
you used the paltry trick and harmed Li Xiaoxia , harmed Song Danping
your this dog ..
dog ... thing
Mr. Tang
can you still recognize Song Danping that you murdered ten years ago ?
song Danping
there is a photograph here
Jin Zijian , a revolution comrade
is he a revolutionary party

grasp

it is not devil that he is a person
it is not devil that he is a person
everybody , please be quiet , do not hurt him
I have the words to say
Mr. Sun , Mr. Sun
you should understand , Mr. Song wants that you help him
it is not for himself
he needs you to complete his wish
Miss Li , I tell you the whole affair
I am not Song Danping , I am Sun Xiaoou
what ?
Mr. Song originally did not die
but he was harmed by Tang Jun , simply was unlike a people
afraid that you see him to be frightened
so he let the person tell you that he died
who would have thought that you got critical illness again
after he was the good friend with me
he asks me to comfort you for him
last time it is me really to meet you
this is all that Mr. Song hopes you can refresh yourself with patience
he ... how about he now ?
he kills Tang Jun now
at the same time , the warlord aspect also doubted that he is a revolutionary party
absolutely this time he cannot live

young lady , young lady
I seemed to do a big dream
I reminded of all things in the past
now all are before me
Miss Li , the past affair has already passed by
at the same time , the sacrifice of Danping
gave us a tremendous precept
we should work harder to struggle
and break this dark influence
fight for the freedom for the public
complete the wish of Danping &apos;s whole life

our proletarian supply detachment calls upon you to sign this sentence .
what &apos;s the matter with you , Vikenty ?
I was walking in the dark , hit a wire .
here you are ...
and now Prof. Polezhaev ... on whom has fallen the mantle of Newton ... receives his rations from the new power .
they only issued bread and herring . thank you so much .
they said in the shop that we were consumers of the 2nd category .
Dimitrij Illarionovich is a consumer , a &quot; mouth &quot; too .
Polezhaev &apos;s a &quot; mouth &quot; , Pushkin &apos;s a &quot; mouth &quot; , Tolstoi &apos;s a &quot; mouth &quot; .
our &quot; mouth &quot; hasn &apos;t had anything to eat .
he &apos;s been working at his book , and he &apos;s written an article .
he was in such a hurry , he sent the article without rewriting it .
it &apos;ll be in the papers tomorrow morning .
and high time !
all our intellectuals are looking to him for support .
if we can only manage to save his book !
never mind , we &apos;ll set it up ourselves if necessary .
I &apos;m afraid to go into his room while he &apos;s working .
for God &apos;s sake , be quiet , the Professor &apos;s working .
- Whose apartment is this ?
- Prof. Polezhaev &apos;s .
he &apos;s busy , he can &apos;t be disturbed .
some people to see you .
I &apos;m busy .
we &apos;ve come about grain-stores .
in that case you &apos;d better speak to Vikenty Mikhailovich .
he &apos;s a specialist on crop-yields .
my specialty is the physiology of the plants .
I happen to be writing a book on the subject .
you are actually interested in the question ?
are you hoarding flour ?
by order of the Council of People &apos;s Commissars ... we are obliged to make a search ... with a view to discovering surplus grain-stores .
the city is in turmoil .
the people are starving .
I don &apos;t want any lecturing from you .
where &apos;s the flour ?
look where &apos;s you &apos;re sitting !

Oh my God !
I don &apos;t understand .

the great Newton himself wore such a mantle .
- Who ?
- Newton , the physicist !
who &apos;s taken my pencil ?
Oh , here it is !
but people are lifting them sometimes .
thank you for your article .
what &apos;s the matter with your glasses ?
he fell when he went to get the bread .
bread !
why , that &apos;s what they were looking for here .
did you notice what deep eyes that sailor had ?
that sailor just killed a man under my very eyes .
who was the man ?
I don &apos;t know . someone or other stole grain on the railway .
Masha ! is the sailor still here ?
here we sit in warmth and comfort , while he is fighting our enemies .
and I even shouted at him , and didn &apos;t apologize .
Prof. Polezhaev , the hireling of the Bolsheviks !
Prof. Polezhaev - a spy !
Prof. Polezhaev has sold himself to the Bolsheviks !
don &apos;t drink unboiled water - the water &apos;s poisoned !
the great scientist has extended a hand to the proletariat !
I &apos;ve never heard of that light before !
do you know what Polezhaev &apos;s famous for ?
Oh , he used to keep the ballerina Kshesinskaya .
come here , boy .
what &apos;s that you &apos;ve got there ?
flour ?
books .
I &apos;ve come from Siberia , at the summons of the Central Committee of the Bolshevik Party .
now somebody &apos;s stolen my kettle .
Bocharov ! how are you !
- Is the Commissar in ?
- He &apos;ll be here soon .
is that today &apos;s Pravda ?
may I have a look at it ?
&quot; for bread and peace !
two questions ... have come to the forefront during the last month ... taking priority over all other political questions .
&quot; the question of bread and the question of peace . &quot;
can you read Comrade Lenin &apos;s handwriting ?
what &apos;s Polezhaev &apos;s specialty ?
the physiology of plants .
we have very few men like him .
- Is he a Bolshevik ?
- He isn &apos;t , but many a Bolshevik might be proud to have written such an article .
he &apos;s a remarkable man .
we must look after him .
are you Bocharov ? from Siberia ?
I &apos;ve heard a lot about you .
Yes , this is the Smolny Institute . all right , it will be done .
you will be appointed director of a bank .
you went to the university , didn &apos;t you ?
but I went in for natural science .
all right - take the press , then .
100.000 copies must be printed by the evening .
don &apos;t forget there are lots of Mensheviks in the print-shop .
the leaflet will be printed .
good !
Prof. Polezhaev must be supported .
he &apos;s my teacher .
a splendid teacher !
go on studying under him .
Lenin wants Polezhaev to be given ... all he needs .
the revolution hasn &apos;t got many people like him .
I want to see Vladimir Ilyich .
Lenin &apos;s gone to the meeting .
haven &apos;t you ever seen him ?
never .
but I &apos;ve read his letters .
you need an assistant .
can I have this sailor ?
comrade Kuprianov , hold yourself at the disposal of Prof. Bocharov .
the meeting is over . let &apos;s go to Comrade Lenin !
colleagues !
listen to what Polezhaev writes in his article !
&quot; a New Era in History &quot;
you &apos;re too late - we know all about it .
the Menshevik group has resolved not to attend Polezhaev &apos;s exams .
we will reply to this article by boycotting him .
we will cast our bold protest in his face .
we won &apos;t allow them to penetrate the walls of the Alma Mater !
congratulations on your birthday , Dimitij Illarionovich !
they &apos;re preparing to greet you .
good morning !
excuse me
- I overslept myself .
I will take your exams in Room 4 .
it &apos;s a double holiday for me today , gentlemen .
in the first place , it &apos;s my birthday - I &apos;m 75 today .
and secondly , I finished my book today .
I shall expect you at my house at 8 o &apos;clock , my friends .
Oh , wait , wait ! at eight !
with Tanya , with Tanya !
I &apos;m sure Dimitrij Illarionovich has written a remarkable book .
he may be a great naturalist - but he &apos;s no historian .
as a medical man I consider he &apos;s in his second childhood .
well , now I think I really can send the manuscript to the printers .
do you know , as I was coming here ...
I was afraid I should be robbed or be run over by a tram .
I devoted seven years of my life to it !
well , bring it to the printer .
is Prof. Polezhaev lecturing today ?
Yes . lecture room no . 4 2nd floor to the left .
I know .
why are you so unfriendly ?
don &apos;t you recognize me ?
cold ?
who &apos;s going to give his exam ?
are you nervous ?
have you been lazy ?
Bolshevik hireling !
Bolshevik hireling !
German spy !
it &apos;s a good thing for you that I &apos;m an old man !
get out of here !
you too !
may I give in my exam ?
sit down . at least nobody will disturb us .
- Who are you - a student ?
- Yes .
how &apos;s your book , Dimitrij Illarionovich ?
I helped you a little , don &apos;t you remember ?
Bocharov ? Misha ?
I would never have recognized you .
don &apos;t tell me that &apos;s a read beard !
you must shave it off .
I mean to .
I &apos;m from Siberia . I came to you straight from the station .
straight from Siberia ?
so you &apos;ve probably forgotten everything ?
- On the contrary , Dmitry Illarionovich !
- Well , let &apos;s see , let &apos;s see .
what a beard !
you look like a senior janitor .
I &apos;ve come to you about the university print-shop .
the printers &apos; shop &apos;s all right - works a lot better than those fellows .
it &apos;s printing my book .
only there &apos;s not enough paper .
they &apos;re printing your book ?
that &apos;s a good thing .
Goodbye , Professor !
and what about the exam ?
another time .
Greetings to your wife !
forgets everything and now shirks ...
Makarych ...
boycotting is mere child &apos;s play .
I know how to get him to withdraw his article .
mister Vorobyov , there &apos;s a sailor here waiting to see you .
the sailors request you to lecture to them on the physiology of plants .
on board your ship ?
with pleasure !
we won &apos;t make use of the university print-shop .
we &apos;ll get the appeal printed in some other print-shop .
Thateveningtheypreparedtoreceiveguests in the home of Prof. Polezhaev .
me at least you can trust !
you have no more devoted disciple ... and are never likely to .
Darwin said :
Omni nisi distipulis !
in Russian :
save me , O Lord , from disciples !
Darwin never said that !
he didn &apos;t say it to you - but to me he did .
arguing again !
I wonder you &apos;re not sick of it !
it &apos;s Dimitrij &apos;s birthday , call a truce !
make yourself useful and set the table .
the guests will arrive , and nothing &apos;s ready !
I stuck to you when you fought the Czarist ministry .
for your sake I risked it all ... expulsion from the university , almost exile ...
almost !
Bocharov here did go into exile ... but with you it was only &quot; almost &quot; .
if we had all gone into exile , who would have been left for scientific work ?
for you , life and science were always interchangeable terms ... but you have betrayed that principle , you have betrayed your country .
how dare you say so !
I &apos;m sick of you ! that &apos;ll do !
he &apos;s been lecturing me all day !
it &apos;s time for your lecture . they &apos;re waiting for you on the ship .
I &apos;m not going to lecture to sailors !
what else did you want to say ?
withdraw your article .
where are you going to in such weather ?
to lecture to the sailors .
I blush for my university !
Vikenty Mikhailovich , don &apos;t let him go alone !
take his galoshes .
Dimitrij Illiaronivich , your galoshes !
our print-shop is being used for printing decrees .
your book has been put aside .
there isn &apos;t enough type .
why should they destroy a book which was written for them ?
I don &apos;t believe it !
what about sending the manuscript to Berlin ?
I &apos;m going to your ship to lecture you .
Vikenty Mikhailovich &apos;s got a toothache , you see .
where are you going , lads ?
to a lecture on the life of plants .
just now , nothing but politics interest them .
that &apos;s all right !
I &apos;ll lecture to them about crops .
please don &apos;t disturb me !
perhaps I &apos;d better go away .
did I ask you to come ?
Prof. Polezhaev will now lecture to you .
the Professor supports the Marxian theory .
he will lecture to you about the life of nature .
he owns his complete works , more than 100 volumes , and it &apos;ll be for us all !
what are you going to call them ?
dear Sirs ?
messieurs Sailors ?
you &apos;re round again , are you ?
I &apos;m waiting to see your triumph .
the boys are waiting , Dmitry Illarionovich !
the sailors are waiting for you .
Oh , yes ! thank you , thank you !
drink !
comrades !
comrade - take your rations !
I shall talk to you just as I talk to my students .
I &apos;ve been working on my book seven years - to make it easier for the ploughman to till the soil .
many scientists have tried to deliver science , from the yoke of the church and reaction ... and to speak the language of the people .
I want to tell you about red pigmentation - the basis of plant life .
I have come to tell you ...
where &apos;s Dimitrij ?
I don &apos;t know . he drove me away .
perhaps I should go and meet him .
I &apos;m never going to come to your house any more - and nobody will ever come to you .
this is goodbye .
believe me , I have good reasons for this .
wait , wait ! don &apos;t ask me about anything , I won &apos;t tell you anything .
tell Dimitrij Illarionovich - that I will have nothing to do with his book any more .
Vikenty ! little Vikenty !
I thought you were a bishop , that time . excuse me , please !
- I was mistaken . I &apos;m sorry .
- Well , here are !
have you finished your book ?
- I have .
- It &apos;ll be an interesting book .
- You think so ?
- All our chaps think so .
no , don &apos;t , I didn &apos;t give the lecture for this .
I know . but please accept your ration .
it &apos;s my birthday today - come and have tea with me .
that would be great .
here ! instead of a gift .
auf Wiedersehen .
- What about having tea with us ?
- Too busy . another time .
nobody here ?
what can you expect ?
they &apos;re shooting in the streets .
because of me ?
shooting in the streets ?
shooting at professors ?
why isn &apos;t Vikenty here ?
of course ...
I shouted at him again .
Yes . he was offended and didn &apos;t come .
perhaps he &apos;ll still come .
after all , he knows you &apos;re in and screams that you love him .
Yes , yes , he &apos;ll come .
I &apos;ll make it up with him .
what right have I to shout at people !
it &apos;s nothing ... don &apos;t worry
we &apos;re never bored in our home .
today &apos;s a real birthday for me . I &apos;ve finished my book .
coming !
congratulations , Dimitrij Illarionovich .
Maria Alexandrovna !
I beg your pardon . thank you . good night !
- Oh my God !
he forgot the bread !
- Who forgot the bread ?
I don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s Vikenty Mikhailovich &apos;s bread .
he was here .
it &apos;s my bread .
it was given to me as a present .
he said nobody would ever come to us any more .
it &apos;s Vikenty Mikhailovich .
Vikenty ?
sit down and play us a nice gay waltz .
- Have you got visitors ?
- You see we have .
I came to congratulate you ... and take some things out .
not just now - we have visitors .
well , anyway , at least I &apos;m here !
I came to implore you ... You &apos;re making a grave mistake .
I &apos;ve heard that already . say something new .
it was you who taught me ...
- To sacrifice myself to science .
- Well , so what !
for God &apos;s sake , water !
thank you .
- Is it boiled ?
- You can rest assured it is .
you taught us that science demands honesty of us -
well , well !
and now you &apos;re going in for spectacular stunts .
an original form of congratulations , I must say !
I have always felt ... that there was something very serious at the back of your eccentricities .
but I hoped all that would pass as you got older .
and in the meantime you &apos;ve become 100 years older yourself !
them have overstepped reason !
you want the Bolsheviks to raise a monument to you ?
you won &apos;t get a monument from them !
the rebels !
having lectures read in a boiler room !
you want to figure in history ?
you won &apos;t !
you have nothing to lose - you can go over to the Bolsheviks .
you haven &apos;t got many years left to live .
but I &apos;m still young !
I want to be a great scientist too !
great ?
you &apos;ll never be that !
well , I won &apos;t venture to keep you .
your guests might take offence and leave ... and you &apos;ll be left all alone ... in the gutter with your Bolsheviks .
I &apos;m an old fool .
for 15 years I &apos;ve been teaching a narrow-minded , worthless man .
you prophesy me death in the gutter ?
but I still have the strength to fling you downstairs !
get out of here , Vorobyov !
Dima , they &apos;re shooting in the streets !
I don &apos;t care !
Yes , alone ... now I &apos;m really alone .
and all because of me .
what have I brought you ?
the betrayal of friends , a lonely old age !
you &apos;ve always been the truest ... the boldest , the handsomest .
you &apos;re cold . I &apos;ll go and get a shawl .
don &apos;t bother . don &apos;t worry .
I want Polezhaev &apos;s manuscript .
- The one that &apos;s being printed ?
- Whatever .
hand me &quot; Plant science and agriculture &quot; !
why ?
it &apos;ll have to be published in Leipzig by Steinkopf .
scatter the type , it &apos;ll have to be used for more pressing work .
editors , talk a little more quietly , please !
for libeling Prof. Polezhaev , the active friend of the Soviet Power
got it ?
the following periodicals will be suppressed , with confiscation of paper-stocks :
&quot; the News &quot; , &quot; Speech &quot; , &quot; The Petrograd Leaflet &quot;
are we thieves ?
I have grown bald in the service of the press .
that &apos;s not a serious argument .
with sugar !
thousands of the intellectuals are on Polezhaev &apos;s side .
they desire to work for the revolution .
by libeling Polezhaev , you rob them of their confidence .
I have all the information on Polezhaev . you know nothing about him .
I &apos;m his pupil . we won &apos;t allow you to throw mud at him .
and now ... &quot; The Evening Hour &quot; for 6 months ...
comrade , we need an agitator .
the Baltic sailors have given Petrograd a present of coal .
the people are unloading it .
they &apos;re exhausted , there &apos;s nothing for them to eat .
all right , I &apos;ll be around in the evening .
&quot; the Seeing Eye &quot; and &quot; Kitchen Satire &quot; : no renewal of license !
we wrote that Polezhaev &apos;s a spy ... but at the end we put a question mark .
in other words , we asked a question .
and the question mark fell out while the article was being set up .
misprints are common occurrences in the printing of newspapers .
how is it that all your misprints are against the Soviet Power ?
have you ever had a single misprint in favour of the Soviet Power ?
I &apos;m listening ?
Hullo . Yes , this is the Propaganda Section .
hush !
comrade Bocharov to Comrade Lenin ? very good !
we &apos;ll take your paper .
comrade Lenin asked you to come over .
it will be used for Prof. Polezhaev &apos;s book .
any questions ? none ?
auf Wiedersehen !
- Wow ! Unrecognized you ! just a damn .
- It &apos;s time for you to go .
I must speak during the break .
we &apos;re going to work without any break .
besides , I can &apos;t leave ! I have to be here !
comrade Lenin is expecting you .
you talk to them instead of me .
it &apos;s easier for me to load ten wagons than to say ten words .
tell them that coal is blood in the veins of Petrograd .
the Baltic sailors have given coal to the Petrograd workers .
the plants , the power stations will work ,
Petrograd will have light again .
and without light it &apos;s hard to work at the benches , or to write a book - and above all , to find the enemy .
cold ?
I &apos;ll go and get some wood from the shed .
light !
that &apos;s in honour of my birthday , to spite Vorobyov .
does Prof. Polezhaev live here ?
the next floor .
Michael Zakharovich ! come quickly !
- I thought you ...
I raise this small glass with great feeling - on behalf of this festive table - to that table where works ... the youngest professor of them all !
your health .
and as always , Dmitry Illarionovich , on your birthday ...
hush ! light !
hear that ?
nobody has any use for me at a time like this .
I write , I keep on , but nobody thinks of me .
this is all I got by mail .
the students have drawn me in a German helmet .
&quot; spy in a mantle &quot; , &quot; pig &apos;s snout &quot;
well , listen to this , I really don &apos;t like it :
&quot; old donkey in the Bolshevik stables . &quot;
where are the limits to human stupidity ?
it was to be expected of them .
- What ?
- It was to be expected from them .
Yes , you &apos;re right .
one of them said to me :
&quot; you &apos;ll die in the Bolshevik gutter . &quot;
Yes . it is to be expected from them .
will you be long in Petrograd ?
I don &apos;t know . there &apos;s a lot to do . the Party will tell me just what .
and there &apos;s no one to tell me what to do .
I shall be alone ... with my specimen jars .
I was alone for eight years ... the frozen taiga , snow-covered huts , drunken guards ... and as a great treat ... baked potatoes .
but I knew ... plant-physiology would be needed again .
you and I will create a splendid botanical institute .
I thought of you out there , in my exile , and kept waiting for your book .
and you say nobody needs you !
that &apos;s not like you !
can &apos;t you take a joke any more ?
I lectured on board a ship today .
it appears I can still be useful .
I &apos;ve given orders for you not to be disturbed .
your pupils must see to such things .
we must look after you .
every word of yours belongs to the whole world .
you &apos;re a revolutionary authority ! you &apos;re one of our trump-cards !
well , we have so many the ships that ...
trump is not enough !
well , we &apos;ve talked enough . time to go to bed .
where shall I put you ?
Masha !
on the chairs .
Hullo ? who &apos;s speaking ?
what ?
Vladimir Ilych ?
which Vladimir Ilych ? wait a minute ...
go ahead !
Hullo . who ?
comrade Lenin ?
good evening , Vladimir Ilych .
no , I wasn &apos;t asleep .
Yes , I &apos;ve entered my 76th year .
I hope so !
I hope so !
no , thank you .
I have all I want . please don &apos;t trouble .
my book &apos;s all right . it &apos;s at the printer &apos;s .
thank you . my greetings to your wife , too . Good-bye .
Masha !
I have something very wonderful to tell you .
a joyous event .
you were right . it turns out I &apos;m not really one .
good morning .
I &apos;ve brought you some visitors .
where &apos;s my manuscript ?
it isn &apos;t here .
you must be mistaken !
it isn &apos;t here ?
Prof. Vorobyov took it with him .
when was it ?
- Excuse me , I don &apos;t understand !
how did all this happen ?
we are busy printing an urgent order .
so don &apos;t even have enough type ...
I found this on the compositor &apos;s table .
- What paper does it come from ?
- Don &apos;t know . - You don &apos;t ?
&quot; herald of Salvation &quot; of the Employee &apos;s Society .
Vorobyov &apos;s at a meeting .
he told us ... to scatter the type of your book .
- He did ? - Yes , he did .
you will not print any more newspapers .
the print-shop will be placed at the disposal of the Soviets .
I beg your pardon ! and who are you ?
- Where &apos;s the meeting being held ?
- I don &apos; t know .
comrades , who can direct me to the meeting place ?
I can !
we will give you three months wages in advance ... if you refuse to carry out ... your professional duties
by three months , the Bolsheviks will fade out .
nobody can force you to give your knowledge ... your experience , your culture ...
let the doctors leave the hospitals , teachers the class-rooms .
Herein lies out salvation , gentlemen .
I give you my word ...
the word of a thief !
that man has stolen my manuscript !
I wanted to save it .
here it is .
Misha ! that &apos;s it !
don &apos;t worry ! not a page will be lost .
I declare the meeting closed .
you will leave please .
refuse to comply !
many here are under a misconception ... and will serve the Soviet power .
and let ill-wishers keep out of my way !
stop !
you &apos;re trampling on a scientific work !
here you are , for example !
don &apos;t worry !
we shall win the day !
pick up the manuscript !
I won &apos;t !
it &apos;s your teacher &apos;s work .
pick it up !
you won &apos;t ?
you were so brave at the university . remember ?
when the police came , you hid behind a cupboard .
good morning .
kindly pick that up .
thank you .
I &apos;m not afraid of your threats , and I despise their cowardice .
detain him !
I shall have to detain you .
toothache again ?
it &apos;s a pity I &apos;m not a dentist ...
go !
a fine beginning for the 76th year of my life .
Theyear1918openedwith severetrials .
the German troops infringing the truce , advanced upon red Petrograd .
PskovandNarvahad alreadyfallen .
the young Soviet Republic mobilized its forces to repel the foe .
the fifth troop-train has left .
when the sixth is ready , let me know at the Tavrichesky Palace .
I &apos;m going to see Prof. Polezhaev .
- How is he ?
- His health is poor .
the Baltic sailors have elected him as deputy to the Petrograd Soviet .
he can &apos;t go .
I &apos;m tired , tired !
for 20 years that I hear the same ...
as your doctor I forbid you to go .
- You &apos;re the doctor !
I &apos;m going out !
- And I won &apos;t allow it !
- I forbid it !
- I &apos;m still going out !
my pulse always accelerates the moment I see you .
well , then !
very well then , drops and complete rest .
- Complete rest .
- Maybe !
and no going out !
not going out ?
great !
Goodbye .
hide his galoshes , or he &apos;s sure to run away .
again I have to apologize to the doctor .
please don &apos;t be angry , Semyon .
you know , he &apos;s always like this .
fee ?
I don &apos;t want any .
he wouldn &apos;t even let me examine him .
he wants to go to a sitting of the Petrograd Soviet .
don &apos;t let him !
his heart &apos;s in a bad state .
I am obliged to interfere .
tie it !
you mustn &apos;t go .
you &apos;ll excite and fatigue yourself .
but my speech at the meeting of the Soviet is for the whole world .
I &apos;m telling you !
I &apos;ll complain to Vladimir Ilyich about you .
I &apos;ll say that you were expelled ...
very well , I &apos;ll go and get a car for you .
Dima !
the doctor says this trip ... will stimulate the action of the heart .
comrades ! the next speaker is Prof. Polezhaev , Professor of Botany ,
doctor of Natural Science of the universities of Oxford and Cambridge , and Deputy to the Petrograd Soviet from the Red Baltic Fleet .
Dimitrij Illarionovich Polezhaev .
Newton &apos;s friend !
- What shall I write ?
- Stormy applause .
no smoking please . Prof. Polezhaev isn &apos;t quite well .
dear Sirs !
Yes , yes , I said &quot; Sirs &quot; ... because you , workers , peasants , Red soldiers and heroic seamen ... are now the masters of our newly-born native land .
I greet you in the name of science , the function of which is to bring about your happiness , present and future .
correct ! right !
comrades ! there are not many men of science here as yet ...
but I ...
I keep forgetting things .
but some scientists are still more forgetful .
they forget that they were educated at the expense of the people ... and reward them with treachery .
I once had such a forgetful pupil . his name was Vorobyov .
I drove him away .
my heart is tickling away the minutes left to me .
there are not so many of them .
a beloved cause demands a mars whole life .
I &apos;m an old man , I must save every second .
you have more left . but you have more to accomplish .
so you must be purposeful , go straight ahead .
do not turn aside , or stop by the way .
you prepare the way and the next generation will be able to ...
I speak in the hearing of the whole world .
and I consider it my duty to tell you ... that I constantly receive letters from the heads of universities , from England , France , Switzerland , and from their governments , offering me money , buildings , laboratories ... if I will abandon my country and work for them .
my colleagues may curse me , in their hatred for revolution , but I shall stay here , with my own people , with my government , with my university .
nothing could tempt me to forego the honour ... of participating in the revolution !
the troop-train is here , Comrades .
communists in possession of arms , fall in !
Baltic seamen to the main entrance !
red Guards from Bocharov &apos;s detachment , draw up in the square .
good luck to you , Comrades !
I &apos;m an old man , but I &apos;m with you .
so long as I can hold my pen and see to write ...
I shall defend the Revolution in my own way .
defend the great , immortal city of the Revolution !
do not surrender our Red Petrograd to the enemy !
farewell , Red Warriors !
red is an unconquerable colour .
it is the colour of creation !
it is the only vitalizing colour in nature !
farewell .
- Do lie down for a bit .
- All right .
- Shall I call the doctor ?
- You might as well .
good evening .
the soup will be very nice .
Dmitry Illarionovich , it &apos;s me , Bocharov ! can I ? - And , Misha !
- How is your health ? - Sit down !
- But my coat !
- Well , sit down , sit down !
sit down .
wort you be late for the train ?
my detachment will pass by , and sing you a farewell song .
your book is already out .
- Even the foreword ! - Yes , yes . - That &apos;s great !
I &apos;ve brought you a letter from Vladimir Ilyich .
from Comrade Lenin ?
&quot; many thanks for your book
&quot; your remarks against the bourgeoisie and for the Soviets
&quot; filled me with enthusiasm .
&quot; I remain , with the best wishes for your health ,
&quot; yours , Vladimir Lenin &quot;
- Lenin .
there !
your health !
and you all want me to write even when I &apos;m ill
tell Vladimir Ilyich ... how happy I am to be his contemporary , how I admire his genius
and I want everyone to know it .
here they come . Goodbye .
drive away the enemy and come back soon .
I &apos;ll hurry . you and I still have a lot to talk about .
we &apos;ve got to find a building for our institute .
in the meantime you can draw up a program .
you think I can do everything .
I &apos;ll do it the day after we beat back the Germans .
Oh , dear !
when are you going to shave off that comic beard ?
as soon as I get a minute to myself .
let &apos;s sit awhile before you go .
Mikhail Makarovich , I &apos;m off !
sit down !
go now , or you &apos;ll be late !
auf Wiedersehen !

come on , get that sun lamp ready .
about 15 minutes is the most I &apos;d advise , Mr. Warriner .
fifteen minutes nothing !
I need a deep Florida tan if it takes all afternoon .
give her the gun .
all aboard for Miami , Palm Beach and Point South .
-Hi , Jerry . -Hello , Frank .
-How goes it ?
-Fine !
-Like to play a little squash ?
-No , thanks .
you &apos;re awfully white-skinned for a guy who spent two weeks in Florida .
-That &apos;s what I thought . -What did you do there , carry a parasol ?
-Or didn &apos;t you go ?
-Don &apos;t go spreading that around , Frank .
pulling a fast one on the little wife ?
Frank , I &apos;m surprised at you . I &apos;m supposed to have been in Florida .
supposing one of Lucy &apos;s friends says to her :
&quot; well , why isn &apos;t he tanned ? &quot; Lucy will be embarrassed .
I &apos;ll be tanned , and Lucy won &apos;t be embarrassed .
what wives don &apos;t know won &apos;t hurt them . what you don &apos;t know won &apos;t hurt you .
I don &apos;t want to know . how about coming by the house ?
some friends are coming by for a late breakfast .
I got a better idea .
come to my place for eggnogs and breakfast ... and maybe later we can duck the women and play some golf .
-Swell , boy , you got me convinced . -Okay .
-See you later , Jerry . -So long , Frank .
come on in !
Hey , Lucy !
that man is here .
maybe she wasn &apos;t expecting you .
no , she &apos;s around somewhere . put your things down anywhere .
-Hello , Celeste . -Hello , Mr. Warriner , you look well .
thank you , Celeste , and vice versa .
where &apos;s Mrs. Warriner ?
look what I got her all the way from Florida .
-She &apos;s out . -She &apos;s out ?
never mind . go get some eggnogs , and we &apos;ll find something to drink to .
come on , gang , enter .
Mr. Smith , look who &apos;s here .
come on , boy .
where &apos;s Mamma ?
look , I &apos;ve got something for you .
come on , get it .
what are you doing , reading my mail ?
several letters there for your wife . yesterday &apos;s , too .
I hope Lucy comes back looking as well as you do .
she &apos;s probably up at her Aunt Patsy &apos;s . she always goes there when she &apos;s lonely .
thank you , Celeste , I &apos;ll take it up from here .
-Jerry . -What ?
supposing Aunt Patsy wasn &apos;t home ?
I get it . I &apos;m up to my neck in funny people !
seriously , I wish Lucy would go out and get some fun now and again . do her good .
that &apos;s the trouble with marriages today . people are always imagining things .
the road to Reno is paved with suspicions .
first thing you know , they &apos;re in a divorce court .
the broad-minded man from the Rio Grande !
if you think I &apos;ll get a chance to prove my broad-mindedness any minute , you &apos;re crazy .
Lucy &apos;s up at her Aunt Patsy &apos;s cabin . I &apos;ll bet on it .
Incidentally , what a swell spot that is . good fishing ....
sometimes , on a clear day across that lake , you can see for ....

any idea where Lucy is ?
you know , she invited me to this--
-Darling ! -Hello , dear !
how grand and brown you are !
Hello , Patsy , dear .
-Did you miss me ?
been thinking about me ?
-Look what I brought you !
all the way from Florida ?
bless your heart !
you know Armand Duvalle , dear .
come on in , Armand .
Mr. Duvalle , this is my aunt , Miss Adams .
Mr. and Mrs. Barnsley , Miss Heath and Mr. Randall .
we &apos;ve had the most terrible time .
Armand &apos;s car broke down last night miles from nowhere ... and we had to stay at the nastiest inn ever .
we were coming home from the junior prom . Armand &apos;s pupil invited us .
Oh , it &apos;s a long story , but I must ....
Hello , there !
your wife , she was the loveliest woman in the party .
Armand , you always say the nicest things .
isn &apos;t that cute ?
did you bring him that ?
-Yes-- -Go catch it !
-Were you disappointed I wasn &apos;t here ?
-Not at all . after all , you didn &apos;t expect me .
and you &apos;ll forgive me for my car &apos;s imperfect performance ?
of course . I &apos;m sorry the inn was so inconvenient .
that &apos;s the only thing that bothers me .
you know , your husband is not like the average American man .
he &apos;s free of all mean suspicion .
he has more the Continental mind . Yes ?
that &apos;s right , I have a Continental mind . will you have an eggnog ?
thank you .
I don &apos;t know what kind of a mind Jerry &apos;s got , Continental or cockeyed ... but he &apos;s a wonder .
now , if I stayed out all night ... and waltzed in with handsome Mr. Duvalle , and said the car broke down .... lt did .
why should Jerry be angry ?
I didn &apos;t build the car .
-you &apos;re perfectly right , dear . -Of course I am .
can &apos;t have a happy married life if you &apos;re always suspicious .
right again .
-a little nutmeg ?
-Please .
-Why am I boring you with private matters ? -we &apos;re not bored .
no one &apos;s interested in my adventure but Jerry , who knows it &apos;s innocent ... just as well as he knows that he just got back from Florida .
I see what you mean .
more drinks , everybody ?
there &apos;s lots left .
-No , thank you , I think we better be going . -you don &apos;t all have to go , do you ?
go ?
no .
-Well , it &apos;s silly to go so soon . -we must go , really .
Patsy , dear , where are you going ?
I haven &apos;t even had a chance to talk to you .
I &apos;ll see you later , my dear .
I always say four &apos;s a crowd .
there &apos;s something in what she says .
thank you .
-Say , are you hungry ?
-To tell you the truth , I &apos;m starved .
why don &apos;t you go out and grab a bite ?
-a strong fellow should take care of himself .
-Why , what have I done ?
-lf you speak of last night , I assure you--
-you don &apos;t believe--
we &apos;ll discuss it in private .
that is if Mr. Duvalle can remember where we keep our door .
in all fairness , you should permit me to remain and explain ourselves .
American women aren &apos;t accustomed to gallantry .
I appreciate your offer , but maybe you &apos;d better go .
pardon me , Mrs. Warriner , you misunderstand .
I am a voice teacher , am I not ?
for one year she has been my pupil . and from time to time , I pat her on the back .
I mean , I congratulate her on her ...
-development . -ls that so ?
-Do I express myself ?
-you &apos;ve been doing all right .
but now my position must be considered . I have never yet been in a scandal .
-Never been caught ?
-No .
I am a great teacher , not a great lover .
that &apos;s right , Armand , no one could ever accuse you of being a great lover .
that is , I mean to say , who &apos;s to say whether you are or not ?
it &apos;s all so silly ! but maybe you had better go .
-l really don &apos;t know what to say . -lf you go , you won &apos;t have to say anything .
-Perhaps it is best this way , Mrs. Warriner . -l think so .
-l will see you soon ? -Yes .
it has been all so perfect .
thank you for everything .
take another bow .
not a bad performance considering no rehearsals or anything .
why , Mr. Warriner , you &apos;re out of your Continental mind .
that was funny , what he said about your Continental mind .
-No doubt he has a better sense of humor . -No , I beg to differ .
right now you &apos;re twice as funny as him .
-Quit stalling , Lucy . -l &apos;m not--
perhaps our marriage means nothing to you .
perhaps you have no sentiment left for me . look at this .
look , a letter l wrote you . did you care when you read it ?
no !
you knew there &apos;d be a letter every morning ... but you were far too busy with Armand Duvalle to give it a thought .
it &apos;s enough to destroy one &apos;s faith , isn &apos;t it ?
I haven &apos;t any faith left in anyone .
I know just how you feel .
what do you mean ?
you didn &apos;t mention in any of your letters the terrible rainy spell in Florida .
the papers were full of it .
-l can explain that , Lucy . -you can ?
don &apos;t try to change the subject . you think a great offense is a great defense .
don &apos;t try to justify your behavior by insinuating things about me .
I haven &apos;t any behavior to justify . I &apos;ve just been unlucky .
you caught me in a truth , and it seems there &apos;s nothing less logical than the truth .
-a philosopher ? -you don &apos;t believe me .
how can I believe you ?
&quot; the car broke down . &quot;
people stopped believing that ages ago .
-His car &apos;s very old . -So is his story .
-Let me tell you something . -Let me tell you something .
I told you the truth about all this , Jerry .
don &apos;t you see ? there can &apos;t be any doubt in marriage .
the whole thing &apos;s built on faith . if you &apos;ve lost that , you &apos;ve lost everything .
when that &apos;s gone the marriage is washed up .
-Do you mean that ?
-Yes . -Then that settles it . -l guess it does .
I wouldn &apos;t go on living with you if you were dipped in platinum .
so divorce me. lt &apos;ll be a pleasure .
you think I &apos;d drag that music lover to court to show people the man you preferred ?
then I &apos;ll divorce you . it &apos;s customary for the wife to bring suit .
it has something to do with the husband being a gentleman .
just get on with the divorce proceedings . I can &apos;t wait .
-l &apos;ll call our lawyer right now . -All right , here .
you don &apos;t mind ?
I don &apos;t know anyone else . you get around much more than I do .
is that so ?
Hello ?
Hello , Lucy .
what &apos;s that ?
divorce ?
you and Jerry ?
don &apos;t do anything in haste you might regret later .
-Marriage is a beautiful thing , and you--
-Can &apos;t she call back after we &apos;ve eaten ?
please be quiet , will you ?
you seem agitated , Lucy . try and calm yourself .
I &apos;d hate to see you take any hasty action in a matter like this .
-Marriage is a beautiful thing , and you--
-Finish your meal .
-Why can &apos;t they call you back later ?
-Will you shut your mouth ?
as I was saying , Lucy , marriage is a beautiful thing .
when you &apos;ve been married as long as I , you &apos;ll appreciate it , too .
your food &apos;s getting ice-cold . you always complain about your food .
just shut your big mouth . I &apos;ll eat when I &apos;m good and ready .
if you don &apos;t like it , you know what you can do . so shut up !
marriage is a beautiful thing .
you see ? because you were a naughty dog , they made you leave the room . come on .
in the case of Warriner v. Warriner , the court grants ... an interlocutory decree of divorce in favor of the plaintiff , Lucy Warriner .
the divorce , without further contesting , will become final 90 days from this day .
plaintiff and defendant then have the liberty to make other marriages , if they so desire .
your Honor , there &apos;s a matter still unsettled .
-The matter about .... -Mr . Smith .
-Yes , Your Honor , Mr. Smith . -Who is Mr. Smith ?
-Mr . Smith is their dog . -No , Mr. Smith is my dog .
-ls that so ?
-Silence !
but , you see , Mr. Smith belongs to me , and she has him .
very well , go ahead .
the animal is in Mrs. Warriner &apos;s possession .
you ordered him from the courtroom at the beginning , for contempt .
-Mr . Warriner wishes to have him because ....
-Because he &apos;s mine !
-He is not . -He is , too .
-He is not . -Silence !
is not .
Mrs. Warriner , step up and tell me why you regard the dog ... as your personal property , so the court may decide if he should remain with you .
nothing would please me more .
your Honor , I saw Mr. Smith first .
it was in that pet shop on Madison Avenue . you know it ?
-you don &apos;t ? it &apos;s between 47th and ....
-lt &apos;s frightfully immaterial .
well , you ought to know .
I decided to buy Mr. Smith ... but I turned away for a moment to look at a Persian kitten . do you like cats ?
I don &apos;t either . so I turned around again , and this man had Mr. Smith in his arms .
I said , &quot; Pardon me , I &apos;m buying this puppy . &quot; and then he just smiled at me .
then somehow , suddenly , the three of us were having lunch ... the man , and Mr. Smith , and I .
and then things happened swiftly ... so I said , &quot; We &apos;d better get married , &quot; and we did .
that way we could give Mr. Smith a better home and live happily ever after .
-Until now . -l see .
in these custody cases , Mrs. Warriner ... we often allow the final decision to rest with the party in question .
you mean Mr. Smith ?
send for the dog .
custody of the dog will depend on his own desire .
-Mr . Warriner , will you step up here , please ? -Yes , Your Honor .
Unfasten him .
you may each call the dog .
-Mr . Smith , come on , boy . -Smitty , look up here .
don &apos;t pay attention . come on , boy .
look up here . you know me .
-Smitty , look up here . -No , don &apos;t !
I win .
custody of the dog is awarded to Mrs. Warriner .
your Honor , that &apos;s not quite fair . I ought to see the dog twice a month or so .
-l &apos;ll take it under advisement .
-Goodbye . thank you . Goodbye .
Goodbye , Your Honor .
-you won &apos;t forget to do that , Judge ?
-l &apos;ll take it under advisement .
Yes , but when will you know ?
look at that rain !
-Why , is it doing anything besides falling ?
-l don &apos;t think so .
nothing unusual ever happens around here .
Patsy , I &apos;m sorry you &apos;re so bored tonight .
why tonight ? I &apos;ve been bored for a month .
if I &apos;d known we &apos;d be buried side by side I &apos;d never have taken this apartment .
I wouldn &apos;t have asked you to come and live with me if I &apos;d known that ... a sort of readjustment takes place after divorce .
readjustment my foot ! that &apos;s just another word for moping around .
don &apos;t be silly . anyhow , where can two women go alone ?
you know dozens of men who &apos;d turn handsprings to take you out .
I &apos;ve got you all dressed up , ready to go out , and you weaken and refuse .
you &apos;re just an old grouch .
I want to go where there &apos;s life . and I don &apos;t mean plant life .
I want to go to the theater .
you know , go places later and step around and do things .
-But you can &apos;t go in all this rain .
-Why not , no taxis ?
no escort .
unless there &apos;s a new ruling , I don &apos;t need an escort to get a drink .
I &apos;m going down to the bar and see Joe .
bartender or no bartender , he &apos;s still a man .
-Maybe he knocks off early . -Patsy , you wouldn &apos;t !
I wouldn &apos;t ?
you &apos;re talking to a desperate woman .
Hello , Smitty , come on up , boy .
-lsn &apos;t he cute ?
-Too bad he can &apos;t wear a top hat .
did you hear what she said ?
-l wonder if you &apos;d do me a favor ? -Well , of course , that all depends .
imagine you living right across the hall from us all of this time .
I think it &apos;s just wonderful that we &apos;ve met this way .
Lucy , may I present Mr. Leeson ?
this is my niece you wanted to meet . her name is Lucy Warriner .
how do you do ?
-Won &apos;t you sit down ? -Thanks .
Mr. Leeson &apos;s just from Oklahoma , Lucy . he &apos;s a stranger in town .
he &apos;d take it as real neighborly of us if we show him some of the bright spots .
he would ?
it &apos;s raining awfully hard . I don &apos;t think--
that &apos;s just exactly what I said , &quot; l don &apos;t think the rain will stop us . &quot;
besides , I think it &apos;ll let up in a few minutes , Miss Warriner .
Mr. Leeson &apos;s a neighbor . he lives across the hall with his mother .
-That &apos;s what you said , right ?
-Yes , with my mother .
we &apos;re here on a visit . I &apos;m in oil , you know .
Marinated , so to speak .
say , that &apos;s a good one ! I got to remember to tell that to my mother .
Mr. Leeson , won &apos;t you tell us something about Oklahoma ?
Oklahoma &apos;s pretty swell .
I got quite a ranch down there . like you to see it sometime , Miss Warriner .
I don &apos;t get out there very ....
l got cattle and horses and chickens and alfalfa and--
-Hello , Jerry . -Patsy , how are things ?
-we weren &apos;t expecting you .
-Why , what goes on ?
Hiya , fellow ! Mr. Smith , how have you been ?
I &apos;ll see you in a minute , boy .
Yeah , sure . -Hello , Jerry . -Hello , Lucy .
what might you be doing here ?
have you forgotten this is my day to visit Mr. Smith ?
it says so right there .
I &apos;m so sorry . Mr. Leeson , this is my husband .
he &apos;s only my husband for , how much longer is it now , 60 days ?
-Fifty-nine . -That &apos;s better , only 59 days .
and don &apos;t worry about him , he has a Continental mind .
-Excuse me , what did you say ?
-l &apos;m glad to know you .
how can you be glad to know me ?
I know how I &apos;d feel if I was with a girl and her husband walked in .
I &apos;ll bet you do .
I don &apos;t think you ought to go around telling people you &apos;re not married .
he looks a nice fellow . how do you think he feels ?
-Why don &apos;t you go play with the dog ?
-you go on with whatever you were doing .
don &apos;t mind me .
any new dogs in the neighborhood ?
been chasing any cats ?
sit down , Mr. Leeson .
-Tell me some more about Arizona . -Oklahoma .
I mean Oklahoma . that &apos;s me for you !
is he getting enough to eat lately ?
he doesn &apos;t look well .
you don &apos;t look so hot yourself .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;s getting enough exercise . he &apos;s got circles under his eyes .
-The court ruled--
-What about a tune , boy ?
Yes . you see , there &apos;s nothing we can do about it .
don &apos;t worry about it , Mr. Leeson . go right ahead .
-My main business is oil .
sing it !
I do pretty well .
I have a ranch . my hobby is horses .
hobby horses !
come on , let &apos;s get out of here .
-Goodbye , Jerry . -Goodbye , Warriner .
what &apos;s the matter ?
-Are you sure you don &apos;t like that fellow ?
-Like him ! -you saw how I treated him , didn &apos;t you ?
-That &apos;s what I mean .
on my ranch I got a little red rooster and a little brown hen ... and they fight all the time , too .
but once in a while , they make up again , and they &apos;re right friendly .
- &apos; Morning , Ma . -Well ?
it was daylight when you came in .
I had a wonderful time . I met a girl--
that &apos;s what I thought . you keep your mind off women .
I can &apos;t , Ma .
you can &apos;t ?
that &apos;s what your father always said .
of course I like Dan Leeson . why not ?
he &apos;s sweet and thoughtful .
you should be the last one to object , you introduced him to me .
he was a man who could take us out . I didn &apos;t expect you to get silly about him .
there &apos;s nothing wrong in liking a man who &apos;s sane and considerate .
I was married to one who was insane and inconsiderate .
your toast is burning .
-What &apos;s her name ?
-Lucy Warriner .
probably an alias .
you &apos;ll laugh for talking that way when you meet Lucy .
she won &apos;t want to meet me . she knows any woman could see through her .
don &apos;t talk that way about Lucy . I &apos;m crazy about her .
I believe she kind of likes me , too . I think I &apos;m in love .
do you know what rebound is ?
trying to get over one love by bouncing into love with somebody else .
it &apos;s fine , except the rebound is rarely the real thing. ln fact , it &apos;s the bunk .
there &apos;s the first bounce , the second , and ....
well , look at me .
you wind up like an old tennis ball .
I &apos;m serious about Dan Leeson . I like him very much .
I &apos;m all through with Jerry , he means nothing .
I don &apos;t love him , and I probably never did .
I &apos;m sure I never loved him . now I hate him . that surprises you , doesn &apos;t it ?
I hate Jerry Warriner and I like Dan Leeson very much .
I hope he &apos;s crazy about me , because he &apos;s the finest man I &apos;ve met .
I know , my toast is burning .
you &apos;re awful sweet and all that , but your mind &apos;s always on something else .
or maybe someone else. ls it , sugar pie ?
no , I &apos;m in love with love .
&quot; ln the spring , a young man &apos;s fancy lightly turns to &quot; ... what he &apos;s been thinking about all winter .
how long have you talked like Amos and Andy ?
for quite some time .
I got wise to the fact that it helps me in my work .
so , as long as I work , you &apos;ll have to pardon my Southern accent .
well , shut my mouth , who &apos;s that gorgeous-looking creature ?
have you heard that gag that &apos;s been flying around town ?
&quot; who was that lady I saw you with ? &quot;
you mean , that &apos;s no lady , that &apos;s your wife ?
I like this place best of all the spots I &apos;ve been to .
-you do ?
-Maybe it &apos;s because I &apos;m so happy .
-Just think of it , Lucy . you &apos;ll be my wife . -Yes , I am thinking of it .
I &apos;ve hoped for it ever since that first night I met you .
I can hardly wait for your final decree to come along .
it &apos;ll come along , Dan .
Incidentally , here &apos;s my husband coming along .
-Hello , folks . -Hello .
this is Dixie Belle Lee .
this is Mrs. Warriner , and Mr. Leeson , the gentleman Mrs. Warriner will marry .
-lt &apos;s mighty fine meeting you . -Now come along .
now , you &apos;re sure we &apos;re not intruding ?
-What do you mean ?
-Wouldn &apos;t you like us to have a drink ?
-Yes , of course . -Sit down .
my , isn &apos;t this cozy ?
so , you two are going to be married .
I was glad to hear that . I said to myself , &quot; That Leeson &apos;s just the man for Lucy . &quot;
-Then I said to myself-- -He &apos;s always talking to himself .
-lsn &apos;t this a charming place ?
-Do you really like it ?
I &apos;m so glad . I almost feel like the place is mine .
-you come here often ?
-l work here , didn &apos;t you know that ?
no .
you &apos;re from the South , aren &apos;t you ?
well , now isn &apos;t he just the cleverest gent ?
how &apos;d y &apos;all ever guess that ?
I don &apos;t know , it was just a shot in the dark .
but Dixie Belle Lee isn &apos;t her real name .
-No ?
-No , she changed it , you see ... because her family objected to her going into show business .
my folks thought I was going to the dogs when I decided to go to work .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;ll be a big success , and then they &apos;ll be proud of you .
thank you. lt &apos;s real nice of you to say that . I &apos;d better go now and get ready .
-Can you stay and see my act ?
-we &apos;ll stay .
-Nothing could drag us away . -See you later , then .
-She seems like a nice girl .
-indeed . enough about Dixie Belle for the moment . let &apos;s talk about yourselves .
so you &apos;re going to live in Oklahoma , Lucy ?
how I envy you . ever since I was a small boy that name has been filled with magic for me .
Oklahoma .
we &apos;re going to live right in Oklahoma City .
not Oklahoma City itself ?
Lucy , you lucky girl .
no more running around the nightspots .
no more prowling around in New York shops .
I &apos;ll think of you whenever a show opens and say to myself :
&quot; she &apos;s well out of it . &quot;
new York &apos;s all right for a visit , but I wouldn &apos;t want to live here .
I know I &apos;ll enjoy Oklahoma City .
of course. lf it gets dull , you can always go to Tulsa for the weekend .
I think a big change like that does one good .
that &apos;s right .
I know this isn &apos;t quite the place , but Lucy tells me you two own a coal mine .
what about it ?
Yes . Mr. Leeson thought that maybe he &apos;d like to buy your interest .
that is , if the price is right .
I was telling Mr. Leeson , I mean Daniel ... about how badly we were doing , and he thought maybe he could do better .
I suppose you told him there wasn &apos;t any coal in it , too .
well , if you &apos;re interested , you might bring around the data tomorrow .
I &apos;m very lucky .
you know what they call me back home ?
I can guess .
I just met her .
I guess it was easier for her to change her name ... than for a whole family to change theirs .
that &apos;d go great out West .
seemed to go pretty well with the cowboy here .
you want to change the subject ?
why don &apos;t you two get up and dance ?
or don &apos;t you dance ?
Lucy doesn &apos;t care much about dancing .
didn &apos;t you know that ?
did Lucy tell you that ?
she &apos;s holding out on you . she &apos;s a beautiful dancer .
why , I used to call her &quot; Twinkle Toes . &quot; Hello , Twinkle Toes .
have you been fooling me , you little rascal ?
honestly , I didn &apos;t think you cared much about it .
care about it ?
why , I could dance till the cows come home .
I won several cups at it myself .
we never won any cups .
maybe you had the wrong partner .
there &apos;s a lot in what you say .
-Can I have this waltz , Lucy ?
here , give this to the orchestra leader and tell him ...
-to play the same number again .
come on , sing .
it &apos;s &quot; all day . &quot;
-l &apos;m sorry . -lt &apos;s all right .
-Not bad . -Thanks .
-Never had a lesson in my life .
-you don &apos;t say . -Have you ?
-Well , yes .
let &apos;s sing another one . that must be him now .
-Hello , Warriner . -Hello , Leeson .
-Hello , Lucy . -Hello , Jerry .
-Glad you dropped up . -Thanks .
I really am very interested in that mine of yours .
Yes , I brought along all the records and history of ....
l &apos;ve looked all over for McCall &apos;s report on that mine .
-l can &apos;t find it anywhere . you must have it . -Maybe I have .
next chance you get , look through your stocking drawer .
she always hides important things in the top drawer of her dresser .
she does ?
every legal paper we had smelled of sachet .
it did ?
even the marriage certificate .
remember when the clerk asked to see it and you couldn &apos;t find it ?
we had a bunch of pals at the hotel . they kept ribbing us all night .
remember when they sent the bellboy ?
we didn &apos;t want ice water .
no ?
what &apos;s the matter ?
when you two are married the three of us can talk more freely .
about this mine business ... this place was formerly owned by the Fullerton Brothers .
you &apos;ve heard of the Fullerton Brothers , haven &apos;t you ?
Yes .
it seems they didn &apos;t know much about the mining situation in Pennsylvania .
-Their racket was mainly--
-Why , hello , Ma !
-Hello . -Hello , Mrs. Leeson .
-Hello , Lucy . -Ma , this is Mr. Jerry Warriner .
-Not-- -Yes , ma &apos;am , that &apos;s right .
-we &apos;re discussing a business proposition . -l see .
-lt &apos;s funny seeing you . -lt is ?
well , it &apos;s funny seeing you .
what I mean is , I was at a tea this afternoon where some people ... were speaking of you and of Lucy , too .
they knew you both before the divorce .
I &apos;ll bet you run into dozens of people who knew us before the divorce .
Yes , we used to get around quite a lot . didn &apos;t we ?
they spoke very well of you . they said you were a real gentleman .
Oh , did they really ?
and they were talking of Lucy , too .
you know , you do sing divinely , dear .
but I &apos;d never realized till this afternoon that you had a teacher ... and a very handsome one , I understand .
there was a woman there , if I hadn &apos;t been a lady I would have slapped her face .
-Why didn &apos;t you ?
-l wish I had , because she insinuated ....
as a matter of fact , she didn &apos;t even insinuate .
well , she was talking about your divorcing Mr. Warriner .
she came right out and said that it should have been ....
no matter , no matter .
-No matter . -No matter .
let &apos;s get down to business , Leeson .
if I &apos;d had time to work this mine myself , I &apos;d have made a fortune .
but I was always too busy making money for other people .
there &apos;s a section up there simply crying for someone to go in ... who has the time and money to give it .
I think if you could sink a shaft in this north corner , right about here ....
wait , let me show you something .
I ought to tell you , Jerry , nobody is listening to you .
the girl &apos;s name needs clearing , partner .
I wouldn &apos;t go so far as to say that .
but I &apos;m sure Mr. Warriner is pleased at the opportunity ... to deny that silly story I heard this afternoon .
why , certainly , Mrs. Leeson .
this woman said Mr. Warriner permitted you to bring proceedings so that ....
well , so that your reputation wouldn &apos;t be ruined .
there , it &apos;s out. i know it &apos;s silly but--
of course it &apos;s silly , and so are you .
-What ?
-See here , Warriner .
I mean it &apos;s silly for your mother to believe such nonsense .
you see , our divorce was one of those tragedies that you read about in the papers .
a trusting woman and a worthless man .
I was never good enough for Lucy and finally she found it out . I was never good enough for Lucy and finally she found it out .
Lucy is above suspicion , and always has been .
she &apos;s as pure as the driven snow , as faithful as she is fair .
and I would that I had been worthy to kiss the hem of her garment .
never during our marital bliss did she cause me a moment &apos;s uneasiness .
never did I have to ask , &quot; Lucy , where have you been , what were you doing ? &quot;
I always knew .
I tell you , something wonderful went out of my life when I lost her .
-l know just how you feel . -How do you know ?
how can you know how it feels to have used up the best years of a woman &apos;s life ?
of course , that &apos;s the way it goes .
excuse me , you &apos;re sitting on my prospectus .
Dan , take those and look them over .
and let me know .
and , Dan ... take good care of her .
I &apos;ll be going now .
Yes , Dan , take good care of her .
maybe you &apos;ll succeed where l failed .
I &apos;m sure that the three of you will be very happy out where the West begins .
if you ever think of me , send me a postcard .
just say , &quot; Having a wonderful time . &quot; l &apos;ll understand .
Goodbye , now .
ma , are you convinced about everything ?
what about the music teacher ?
you two try and settle things for yourselves . let me know how it comes out .
put a light in the window if it &apos;s yes , two if it &apos;s no .
and if you can &apos;t make up your minds , just pull down the shade .
Hello .
what are you doing in my apartment , if I &apos;m not too inquisitive ?
I thought after my swell reference about you , I deserved a drink .
-Wish I &apos;d mixed it for you . -l see what you mean .
certainly do appreciate all the charming things you said about me .
when I get the chance , I hope I can do as much for you .
it was nothing at all .
I try to go through life-- l know , spreading a little sunshine as you go .
no , frankly , I was worried about you .
you &apos;ve never asked for money . do you need any ?
no , I think I can struggle along without any help from you .
I thought maybe you made a bad investment .
-No . I only made one bad investment . -Don &apos;t bite me .
I thought that maybe Buffalo Bill &apos;s millions might have something to do--
nothing to do with anything .
millions or no millions , he &apos;s a very charming person .
I &apos;ve seen him .
I can &apos;t possibly interpret this as jealousy .
no .
I &apos;ve come out from behind those clouds .
I &apos;ve taken a definite turn for the better .
nothing &apos;s going to hurt me anymore .
that &apos;s too bad , Jerry .
-Did it hurt you much ?
-Just the one hand ?
-Just the one hand .
I &apos;ll be going . I always like to leave people laughing .
is there anything I can get you for it ?
no , I &apos;m a stout fellow , I &apos;ll carry on .
-Where &apos;s Mr. Smith ?
-Out with Aunt Patsy .
tell me something before I go , will you ?
-What do you see in this fellow ?
-None of your business .
not that I care , but what kind of a line could he have that would impress you ?
you might be surprised . you could take a few lessons and profit nicely .
you &apos;d be surprised what I &apos;d give to get an earful of that .
-you would . -l couldn &apos;t wait to see you .
I had to tell you how awful l feel about what happened .
you &apos;ll have to forgive Ma . she &apos;s kind of old-fashioned .
-l &apos;ll forgive her . -you won &apos;t hold it against her ?
no . now you go and dress for dinner . we &apos;ll be very late .
I &apos;m a lot quicker than you are .
just to prove that you &apos;re not mad , will you give me a little kiss ?
-Right here in the hall ?
don &apos;t be silly . -There &apos;s nobody around .
-you never can tell if someone &apos;s around . -l &apos;ll come in .
don &apos;t come in . we &apos;ll be awfully late .
-Don &apos;t be bashful . -l &apos;m not bashful .
I &apos;ve never kissed you before . and I don &apos;t think this is exactly the place .
if you knew how crazy l am about you , you wouldn &apos;t hesitate . I can &apos;t sleep nights .
-Try drinking some hot milk . -l must be in love ...
-because I started writing poetry to you . -Poetry .
I was going to surprise you with it at dinner , but it &apos;s short. lt goes like this :
&quot; to you , my little prairie flower l &apos;m thinking of you every hour
&quot; though now you &apos;re just a friend to me I wonder what the end will be &quot;
excuse me , Dan , I do laugh at the oddest times .
you see what I mean ?
&quot; Oh , you would make my life divine
&quot; if you would change your name to mine &quot;
that &apos;s really ....
that &apos;s beautiful , Dan . it &apos;s really beautiful . there &apos;s my phone .
you &apos;ve got to go now , really .
-Hello . -Comment ça va , madame ?
-you haven &apos;t forgotten about tomorrow ? -Look , I have company .
all right , wait a minute , hold the phone .
there , now go on , Dan , I &apos;ll see you later .
Lucy , you &apos;ve made me the happiest man in the world .
dreamed of this moment for days , now it &apos;s all come true .
Dan , really !
I &apos;ll go home now and dress for dinner . I &apos;m so happy I could eat three steaks .
Hello ?
telephone .
Hello ?
can I expect you tomorrow ?
at 3 : 00 tomorrow afternoon ? I think that would be convenient .
very well then , 3 : 00 tomorrow afternoon . Goodbye .
-Who was that ?
-Why should it interest you ?
wait a minute , after all , the final decree isn &apos;t in yet .
-lf you must know , it was my masseuse . -My who ?
I &apos;ve heard everything . I &apos;m going out to get some popcorn and pink lemonade .
I &apos;ve just seen a three-ring circus .
Armand Duvalle in ?
-Please , your name ?
-Jerry Warriner. ls my wife here ?
I do not know .
what do you mean you don &apos;t know ?
-l only know I don &apos;t know . -you wouldn &apos;t mind if I look around .
me , jujitsu .
-Me , jujitsu . -ls that so ?
me , jujitsu , too .
you must not go in . you must not disturb him .
I can &apos;t go in , he must not be disturbed .
you should have seen your master this afternoon .
come on , sit up , boy .
no , better still , I tell you ... go hide your eyes and I &apos;ll give it to you that way .
five , ten , fifteen , twenty , twenty-five . no peeking .
five , ten , fifteen , twenty , twenty-five , thirty , thirty-five . you ready ?
all right , then , come on .
you &apos;re too smart .
honestly , Patsy , you should have seen Jerry this afternoon .
and when that chair started to slip from under him .
-l will say that for Jerry , he &apos;s never dull . -He was so silly , though .
I know he thought he &apos;d find me in Armand &apos;s arms .
he must have been terribly disappointed .
he must have felt awful about not finding you two in a clinch .
Jerry &apos;s always had the most fantastic way of getting into scrapes .
we &apos;ve had some grand laughs together .
but a girl really wants dependability and security .
Yes , I suppose she does .
then she ought to buy an annuity . be more fun than Leeson .
don &apos;t explain . I &apos;m not marrying him .
that &apos;s what I wanted to tell you . I &apos;m not either .
I can &apos;t marry him because I &apos;m still in love with that crazy lunatic .
and there &apos;s nothing I can do about it .
Patsy , here and there , now and then ...
-l &apos;ve done a few things for you , haven &apos;t I ?
-Yes .
here &apos;s a note that I &apos;ve written to Dan explaining exactly why I can &apos;t marry him .
I could never phrase anything in person as beautifully as I have in this note .
but now I &apos;ve lost my nerve about giving it to him .
-Could you sort of see that he gets it ?
-l should say so .
well , I tried to forget Jerry .
I know .
that &apos;s why you jumped at Leeson as if he were the last man on earth .
I &apos;ll answer that .
every time I open the door somebody walks in .
-How do you do ? -How do you do ?
-Hello , Armand . -you sent for me , madam .
Yes , I &apos;ve been so embarrassed about what happened ... in front of your guests I couldn &apos;t get out of there soon enough .
your husband is a very funny man , isn &apos;t he ?
I &apos;m convinced he must care about me or he wouldn &apos;t do those funny things .
Yes , but he doesn &apos;t care much about me .
no , Armand , that &apos;s just what I &apos;m getting at .
-l &apos;m wondering , could you do me a favor ? -But of course .
I &apos;ve been thinking ... I wonder if you could convince him ... that everything was just as I said it was that night at the inn .
I &apos;d be glad to .
but does he carry a gun ?
you &apos;re not afraid of him ?
-Of course not , but--
-Will you do it for me ?
as soon as possible ?
Yes .
and , by all means , he mustn &apos;t know that I had anything to do with it .
-No . -As soon as possible .
Mr. Smith !
how are you ?
-But this is much too soon . -lsn &apos;t it ?
-Much too soon . -What can I do ?
-you can &apos;t keep standing here . -l know , but where can I go ?
-Look , out here . -No .
look , in the bedroom . hurry up .
-Hiya , fellow . -Hello , Jerry .
-Hello , Patsy . how have you been ?
-Fine .
you knew it was me , didn &apos;t you ? sure you did .
you remembered me , didn &apos;t you ? sure , you bet .
get away .
-Hello , Jerry . -Hello , Lucy .
-l suppose you know why I dropped in . -No , I don &apos;t exactly .
as a matter of fact , I came to apologize for my behavior today in Duvalle &apos;s apartment ...
-studio , or whatever he calls his joint . -Oh , that ?
I certainly acted like a prize lunatic , and I &apos;m sorry .
-lt was nothing at all . -Nothing ?
nothing except the most ridiculous and sickening exhibition ... mortal man ever made of himself .
I don &apos;t know why I act like that .
unless it &apos;s because of the effect that Duvalle has on me .
I never knew anyone that can aggravate me the way he does .
-l can &apos;t think about him without seeing red . -you shouldn &apos;t get so excited .
a mere mention of his name and I feel positively murderous .
you do ?
-What &apos;s the matter with you ?
-Nothing .
I was just thinking about your problem . you certainly have a problem .
I know I have a problem , and I know how I feel , too .
I guess there &apos;s nothing I can do about it .
look at Mr. Smith .
-l guess he wants to play . -Yes .
here , you go and hide it for him .
no fair peeking , Smitty .
all right , let &apos;s go . come on .
Oh , no , you &apos;re cold .
you &apos;re colder than ice . cold , cold .
Oh , boy , what &apos;s wrong with you ?
nice going , fellow . let it go . good boy .
well , Lucy ... the main idea is , do you accept my apology ?
besides making a blue-ribbon sap of myself today , I must have embarrassed you terribly .
you took it fine , though .
-you must admit you were--
-Yes .
-What was that ? -Nothing , just an old mirror .
-The boy &apos;s getting worse every day . -Mr . Smith , that &apos;s a fine thing .
I &apos;m surprised at you . trying to get rid of me ?
no , he wasn &apos;t trying to get rid of you , you know it .
well , I really hadn &apos;t planned to leave so soon .
I thought , if you have nothing to do , you might like to go for a drive with me .
well , the air will do you good , and we can talk things over ?
-l &apos;d love that . Yes , it would do me good . -Swell .
-Where &apos;s your car ?
-Downstairs , in the garage .
while I &apos;m changing , you get the car and I &apos;ll meet you out front .
-Okay , dear . -l won &apos;t be a minute .
that &apos;s funny , I only bought the hat an hour ago and look at it .
did you have a haircut , maybe ?
-No . -No ?
maybe you have it on backwards . put it on the other way around .
well , I hadn &apos;t thought of that . wait a minute .
Yes , there , now that &apos;s more becoming .
it is a bit roomy . maybe they &apos;re wearing them that way this year .
well , I &apos;m not .
looks mighty funny to me .
look at your ears . that &apos;s why . your ears are all down .
what &apos;s wrong with it ?
-Stick your ears up underneath . -Don &apos;t be silly .
how can you stick your ears up ?
that &apos;s no good .
well , I always put my ears in .
-Who &apos;s there ?
-Me , and my ma .
Lucy , I &apos;ve caused you enough trouble for one day .
he better not find me here . I &apos;ll duck in the other room .
no , no , but ....
could you ....
-Hello , there . -Hello , Aunt Patsy .
good evening , Mrs. Leeson . good evening , Mrs. Leeson .
Lucy , you didn &apos;t come over this morning the way you usually do .
-l was so busy this morning . -That &apos;s what I kept telling you , Ma .
-Do you mind if I sit down ?
-No , not at all .
-l &apos;ve got an awful headache . -Well , I &apos;m getting one .
I thought maybe you were angry at my repeating what that awful ....
nonsense , Mrs. Leeson .
-What on earth was that ?
-Somebody &apos;s cleaning up in there .
I was afraid ....
-Must they do that ?
-Yes-- I was afraid , but I knew that in your heart you knew ... that I never suspected you .
of course not , Mrs. Leeson .
the first time Dan talked about you , I said , &quot; Why , she sounds like a sweet little thing . &quot;
why , to know Lucy is to love her .
Lucy , I got a surprise for you . ma and I talked it all over .
I hope you are going to like Oklahoma , because I &apos;m going to ask you ....
excuse me .
they forgot to touch second .
come on , Dan .
well , I guess a man &apos;s best friend is his mother .
I certainly learned about women from you .
-Here &apos;s your diploma . -Come on .
what &apos;s the matter with you , Smitty ?
I see what you mean . Patsy , look at this .
Oh , yes , that &apos;s Barbara Vance .
-you know who she is , don &apos;t you ? -Yes , I know who she is .
the madcap heiress. lsn &apos;t that what the papers usually call her ?
millions of dollars and no sense . I wonder what she &apos;s doing with Jerry .
entertaining him , running around town with him ... and I imagine falling in love with him .
-you can &apos;t tell all that from this picture . -No .
but I can tell it from what I &apos;ve heard . if rumor is true , Barbara is quite a girl .
and Jerry &apos;s having a lot of fun .
come in .
Hello , Jerry .
Hello , Lucy , what &apos;s the nature of this visit ?
well , I just thought I &apos;d ....
-Do you know what today is ?
-Certainly .
our divorce becomes final today . tomorrow , we &apos;ll both be back in circulation .
I just thought I &apos;d drop up and wish you a lot of luck .
that &apos;s very nice of you . would you like to join me for some wine ?
of course I would .
that was a cute picture of you and Barbara in the morning paper .
I love the caption : &quot; off with the old love . &quot;
I thought &quot; Out of the frying pan &quot; might have been better .
is that so ?
well , I think that Barbara and I will be very happy together .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;ll be very happy .
only I don &apos;t think you &apos;ll be as happy as Daniel and I .
what ?
-ls that still on ? -What do you mean , &quot; ls that still on ? &quot;
after that two-men-in-a-bedroom farce ... I sort of imagined that when we left , he left .
Oh , no . I just explained things to him very simply .
Oh , did you ?
did you say our cars broke down ... and we had to stay at your place because of the taxi strike ?
no , I didn &apos;t tell him that . I told him the truth .
and , strangely enough , he believed me .
Yes , it was very refreshing .
well , what shall we drink to ?
let &apos;s drink to our future .
here &apos;s hoping you and Barbara will be very happy ... which I doubt very much .
let &apos;s drink to your happiness with Buffalo Bill ...
-Good . - ... which doesn &apos;t even make sense .
-l &apos;ll tell you . we &apos;ll drink to the two of us . -Good .
as we go down life &apos;s highway ... you going your way ... and I going my way .
-Okay ?
-All right .
it &apos;s flat .
I &apos;ll open another bottle .
you &apos;ll have to hurry it up though because I &apos;m meeting Daniel .
I think champagne is so fitting to round out our romance .
I remember the first drink we ever had together .
you , in your very best manner , said :
&quot; lt must be champagne . &quot;
and then you offered a toast , you remember ?
-No , I don &apos;t . -Well , being a woman , I do .
you said ....
this &apos;ll land you a laugh .
you said :
&quot; lend an ear , I implore you
&quot; this comes from my heart I &apos;ll always adore you
&quot; till death do us part &quot;
remember ?
it was pretty swell .
I mean , while it lasted .
all beautiful things must end ... so I guess we may as well call it a day .
if you don &apos;t mind , I &apos;ll call a car .
would you call a car for me ? right away , please .
Hello ?
who &apos;s this , may I ask ?
it &apos;s what &apos;s-her-name . I only said hello . maybe you can pick it up from there .
-Did you have to answer my phone ?
-l thought it was about the car . I &apos;m sorry .
what am I going to tell her ?
you can think of something . you always could .
-l haven &apos;t time to think of anything . -Tell her you &apos;ll call her back .
-How can I tell her I &apos;ll call her back ?
-Then tell her to call you back .
Hello ? Hello , darling .
well , it took you long enough . have you decided who the woman is ?
isn &apos;t that funny , I knew you were going to ask me that .
-So did I. -Quiet .
it &apos;s very simple , dear. lt &apos;s my sister .
your sister ?
how are you going to get out of that ?
she just got back from Paris , dropped in to see me .
Jerry , you &apos;re slipping .
I &apos;d love to meet your sister . why don &apos;t you bring her along tonight ?
she can &apos;t come this evening . she has a previous engagement .
she wants me to come over ?
naturally she &apos;s anxious to meet you , too , but ....
Yes , tell her I &apos;d love to meet her . tell her to wear boxing gloves .
she said she &apos;ll break her engagement and come over later .
-But I strongly doubt that .... -Yes , I doubt it .
dear , I &apos;ll do my best to fix it up so the two of you meet very soon .
-Yes . Goodbye . -That &apos;d be lovely .
I &apos;m in a fine fix . she wants to meet my sister .
-you &apos;re a big help . -you know me . anything I can do ....
-What ?
to break it up ?
-l see what you mean .
I &apos;m in a fine mess .
Yes , hello ?
I did it again .
what does she do ?
call every five minutes ?
-you shouldn &apos;t take that from anybody . -Hello , Barbara .
put your foot down ....
-l told you she couldn &apos;t make it this evening . -She can &apos;t get away with it .
there &apos;s no reason to call me every five minutes about it , is there ?
no . well , all right .
-Good evening , Mr. Warriner . -Good evening .
-Hello , Barbara . -Hello .
good evening , Mrs. Vance .
-Hello , Mr. Vance . -Jerry .
where &apos;s your sister ?
she was terribly sorry she couldn &apos;t be here tonight .
she didn &apos;t weather the boat trip well . when I left , she was calling the doctor .
you can imagine my surprise when a woman answered the phone .
you can &apos;t blame me for being suspicious .
Barbara , you can &apos;t have a happy married life if you &apos;re always suspicious .
there can &apos;t be doubts in marriage .
marriage is based on faith . if you lose that , you &apos;ve lost everything .
very well said , Jerry .
Yes , wasn &apos;t it ? I think I read it in a book or something .
I was just thinking , will your sister be here for the wedding ?
-l doubt that very much , Mrs. Vance . -Maybe I should ask her to be a bridesmaid .
I think she &apos;s sailing back to Paris almost immediately .
she said she &apos;ll try to see you before she goes .
you &apos;d like my sister . she &apos;s your type .
-Where did she go to school ?
-Excuse me ?
-l said , where did she go to school ?
-ln Switzerland .
-you say your father was a Princeton man ?
-That &apos;s right , sir . class of &apos; 92 .
he tells some funny stories about the place in those days .
he tells one in particular about a football game .
it seems Yale was playing Princeton one day ... and with the ball on Princeton &apos;s two yard line , Yale fumbled .
a minute to go , Dad picked up the ball , and ran ....
Miss Lola Warriner .
Hello , brother dear . I made it .
what did you say , dear ?
-l just asked how you were feeling . -l &apos;m feeling fine . and you ?
Mrs. Vance , may I present my sister , Lola .
how do you do ?
-lt &apos;s lovely to know you . -Thank you .
-Won &apos;t you come in ?
-Thank you .
-Barbara , this is Lola . -How do you do ?
it &apos;s nice to be able to meet you .
I &apos;ve seen your pictures , and wondered how you look .
-l wondered about you , too . -Well , thank you .
-Lola ?
-Yes , dear ?
this is Barbara &apos;s father , Mr. Vance .
-Mr . Vance , my sister . -How do you do ?
what &apos;s the matter ?
nothing , only I never would have known you from his description .
-Won &apos;t you sit down ? -Thank you .
did I interrupt something ? weren &apos;t you talking when I came in for ....
would you excuse me , Mrs. Vance ? my handkerchief .
thank you .
it &apos;s me. lsn &apos;t that silly ?
it &apos;s you this time , Mrs. Vance .
look , I &apos;ll just put it over here , and get it out of the way .
dear !
I guess that could go on and on and on .
I hope not .
go on with your story , honey .
Yes , I was telling a story about my , about our father .
Oh , you were ?
I don &apos;t want to be rude , but may I have a drink ?
I had three or four before I came , but they &apos;re wearing off , you know how that is .
don &apos;t look at me like that . you like a little drink yourself .
we call him Jerry the Nipper .
likes to sneak it when nobody &apos;s looking . so cute about it , too .
I &apos;ve seen him go an evening , apparently having nothing to drink ... and all of a sudden , fall flat on his puss .
a glass of sherry , perhaps ?
will you get Miss Warriner a glass of sherry ?
a glass of sherry ?
excuse me .
I don &apos;t like sherry .
-Would you make that ginger ale please ?
-Ginger ale ?
I &apos;m sorry to interrupt you again , Jerry . now , what were you saying ?
I was just telling one of Father &apos;s stories . you &apos;ve heard it .
with a minute to go , Dad had the ball--
-a ball ?
what ball ?
-The football .
what in the world was Dad ever doing with a football ?
I was just telling a story about when Father was at Princeton . you remember--
Oh , yes , of course I remember . Pop loved Princeton .
he was there nearly 20 years .
if ever a man loved a place , he did . he just adored it .
and he certainly kept it looking beautiful .
you &apos;ve seen the grounds , of course .
of course ?
-Thank you . -l &apos;m afraid I &apos;m--
so sorry !
-Here &apos;s your handkerchief . -Thank you .
I &apos;m afraid that my sister has a somewhat distorted sense of humor .
so have I .
what she meant was , Father presented the college ... with some of its finest landscapings .
excuse me . was I thirsty ! it must have been that ham I had for dinner .
-l think my brother &apos;s pretty swell , don &apos;t you ?
-Oh , yes .
he &apos;s always been pretty swell to me .
I was working my head off at the Virginia Club .
but the minute he started doing better , you know what I mean ... why , he made me give up my job and take a trip to London and Paris ... and ....
I think that was pretty swell , don &apos;t you ?
what did you do at the Virginia Club ?
-you see-- -l &apos;ll tell her !
it was a little act , kind of ....
well , it &apos;s a little hard to explain .
-Have you got any records ?
-Records ?
-Yes . we have some records . -Well , maybe if we ....
say , wait a minute !
don &apos;t anybody leave this room . I &apos;ve lost my purse .
-Why , here it is . -Well , am I relieved .
where are the records ?
come this way and I &apos;ll show you .
look , will you keep an eye on that for me ?
here &apos;s my song . would you like to have me do it for you ?
-Well , no , I don &apos;t--
-Okay .
you &apos;ll have to put that on . it &apos;s a little fancy for me .
the one we &apos;ve got at home , you just wind .
I wouldn &apos;t , if I were you .
I won &apos;t do it the way I did at the club ... if that &apos;s what you &apos;re afraid of .
you think I &apos;m a fool ?
the number has some wind effects ... but you &apos;ll just have to use your own imagination about them .
get it ?
I never could do that .
are we going so soon ?
I was just beginning to enjoy myself .
good night . good night , all .
-Where are you going ?
-l &apos;m going to Patsy &apos;s cabin .
-you &apos;re not in any condition to drive . -l can make it in two minutes on two wheels .
that &apos;s what you think .
-Get over . -This is my car . I want to drive my car .
-Over . -No .
-l wish you &apos;d stayed in there . -That &apos;s right .
would you mind shutting that off , or at least turning it down ?
give it to me .
that &apos;s right , put it where we can find it .
-Here , you can &apos;t do that . -What ?
-Shut that thing off . -What ?
it &apos;s against the law . besides , you &apos;ll wake everyone up .
what ?
he says we &apos;ll wake up ....
why don &apos;t you help me ?
-lt &apos;s beautiful up here , don &apos;t you think so ?
-Sure , it &apos;s swell .
if it wasn &apos;t for you , I &apos;d have missed all this .
that &apos;s right .
I suppose by the time I get to town ... it will hardly be worthwhile going to bed .
you mind if I use your car to go home ?
no , I don &apos;t mind , only I think it &apos;s awfully silly .
Patsy will be disappointed .
well , thanks . I &apos;ll go home .
it &apos;s all right with me . my goodness , I just thought ....
Yes , you just thought that if I &apos;d stay up there ... you &apos;d show me exactly how innocent a night in the country can be , didn &apos;t you ?
are you still harping on that same old string ?
it doesn &apos;t matter to me whether you go or stay .
I was just trying to make it easier for you , that &apos;s all .
did you have to throw that gadget away ?
you want me to go back and look for it ?
what else can happen to us ?
a lot .
-What &apos;s that ?
-Two motorcycles .
-Anybody riding them ?
-There are two men .
-Are they in uniform ?
-Yes .
fine .
-Turn down that radio . -l can &apos;t .
what do you mean you can &apos;t ?
you lost the control ?
you can &apos;t let it run that way !
-Let me take a look at it . -Wait a minute , I &apos;ll get out of your way .
see what you can do .
-Help me to sort the wiring . -Let &apos;s take a look at it .
don &apos;t !
it &apos;s always good .
do you know you can get a ticket for that ?
-ls this your car ?
-Nope !
-Whose car is it ?
-l &apos;ll give you one more guess .
so it &apos;s yours . where &apos;s your ownership card ?
-ln my bureau &apos;s upper right-hand drawer . -Are you sure this is your car ?
of course I &apos;m sure !
if it &apos;s your car , what &apos;s the license number ?
what is it ?
I don &apos;t know . they change it every year .
don &apos;t look now , but what &apos;s the number on your motorcycle ?
-Have you folks been drinking ?
-No , I haven &apos;t , but ....
-Let me see you walk this line . -Come on .
go on , honey , truck it !
-Now what have you done ?
-The brakes are bad .
it &apos;s a bad break for us , too . now we haven &apos;t any transportation .
could you two gentlemen take us to my aunt &apos;s cabin ?
it &apos;s only 15 miles .
-That is , if you &apos;ve nothing else to do . -No , I don &apos;t .
-Have you ?
-Oh , no .
Oh , that &apos;s fine .
where will you sit ?
I &apos;ll have to figure that one out , I guess .
come on , try it. lt &apos;s fun !
now , listen , you two . don &apos;t say a word to this guy .
who are these people ?
why , that &apos;s Mrs. Warriner and that &apos;s Mr. Warriner .
how do you do ?
Hello .
I guess that settles it . will you get my car out in the morning ?
in the meantime , think of something you &apos;d like for Christmas . Goodbye .
-l hope you have a nice trip back . -Thank you .
Hi , Dad .
Hello , Dad .
everything all right with you ?
-Oh , I &apos;m feeling fine . -That &apos;s good .
but I wasn &apos;t expecting nobody tonight .
isn &apos;t Aunt Patsy here ?
-Well , no . -She isn &apos;t here ?
-But I thought for sure she was here . -l didn &apos;t .
isn &apos;t that funny ?
let me get you some coffee .
Oh , no , I don &apos;t think so , Dad .
it might keep me awake . I &apos;m going right to bed . I &apos;m awfully tired .
see ? she &apos;s all in .
-Oh , Dad , is this room in order ?
-Yes .
that &apos;s fine . Mr. Warriner will sleep in there .
give him a couple of nice warm blankets . he has a bad cold .
is that right ?
I &apos;ve had a bad cold now for some considerable time .
-That &apos;s too bad . -About three months .
how are you doing in there ? how are you doing in there ?
I &apos;m having a little wardrobe trouble .
you should see me .
I &apos;m glad you told him I have a cold . he fixed me up good .
my nightie is coming to me through the courtesy of Aunt Patsy .
go , get off !
Air-conditioned .
-What &apos;s wrong with this ?
-l don &apos;t know .
the lock isn &apos;t very practical , is it ?
no , it &apos;s not so very practical ....
l guess it will serve its purpose .
well , good night .
good night .
I &apos;m afraid we &apos;re going to have trouble with this .
I guess I &apos;ll be all right .
-Good night . -Good night .
good night .
I told you we &apos;d have trouble with this .
Yes .
in a half an hour , we &apos;ll no longer be Mr. and Mrs .
funny , isn &apos;t it ?
Yes , it &apos;s funny that everything is the way it is , on account of how you feel .
I mean , if you didn &apos;t feel how you do , things wouldn &apos;t be as they are , would they ?
I mean , things could be the same if things were different .
-But things are the way you made them . -Oh , no .
things are the way you think I made them . I didn &apos;t make them that way at all .
things are just the same as they always were ... only you &apos;re the same as you were , too ... so I guess things will never be the same again .
good night .
-Got caught in the door . -Good night .
good night .
why , you ....
well , there it goes again .
you &apos;re all confused , aren &apos;t you ?
-Aren &apos;t you ?
-No .
you &apos;re wrong about things being different ... because they &apos;re not the same .
things are different , except in a different way .
you &apos;re still the same , only I &apos;ve been a fool .
but I &apos;m not now .
as long as I &apos;m different , don &apos;t you think ... maybe things could be the same again ... only a little different ?
you mean that , Jerry ?
are you sure ?
no more doubts ? no more being ....
-Except ....
-Except what ?
-There &apos;s only one thing that bothers me . -What ?
this darn lock .
is that all ?
you think maybe if you ....
good night .

I &apos;m sure I &apos;ll get along somehow .
everything &apos;s going to be all right .
but I do need a place to sleep at night .
( Chuckling ) I can &apos;t sleep in the ground like you or in a tree the way you do .
and I &apos;m sure no nest would possibly be big enough for me .
maybe you know where I can stay .
in the woods somewhere ? ( TWITTERING )
you do ? ( TWITTERING )
will you take me there ?
Oh , it &apos;s adorable !
just like a doll &apos;s house .

then they &apos;re orphans .
that &apos;s too bad .
I know !
we &apos;ll clean the house and surprise them .
then maybe they &apos;ll let me stay .
now , you wash the dishes .
you tidy up the room .
you clean the fireplace .
and I will use the broom .
( singing ) Just whistle while you work
and cheerfully together we can tidy up the place
so hum a merry tune
( humming ) lt won &apos;t take long when there &apos;s a song to help you set the pace
and as you sweep the room lmagine that the broom ls someone that you love and soon you &apos;ll find you &apos;re dancing to the tune
Oh , no , no , no , no ! put them in the tub .
when hearts are high the time will fly
so whistle while you work

some day when my dreams Come true !
news has come from Vienna !
&quot; Leopold of Austria has seized King Richard on his return from the Crusades .
our king is being held prisoner . nothing further is known .
his Highness Prince John will make ...
... furtherpublic pronouncement tomorrow . &quot;
and how are the dear Saxons taking the news , Sir Guy ?
they &apos;re even more worried than Longchamps , Your Highness .
they &apos;ll be more than worried whenI squeezethefat out of their pampered hides .
-you intend to act on your plans ?
-What better moment than this , Sir Guy ?
whoever would have thought my dear brother ...
... wouldbeso considerate as to get captured ...
... andleaveallEngland to my tender care ?
he may disapprove when he returns , Your Highness .
if he returns . and I &apos;ll see to it that he doesn &apos;t .
we must drink to this moment , Sir Guy . golden days are ahead .
I &apos;ll assign tax districts to you tomorrow .
tomorrow , Your Highness .
-But who &apos;s gonna pay me ?
-Pay ! pay !
that &apos;s all you Saxons think about .
didn &apos;t I tell you it was for Prince John , who &apos;s just come up from London ?
stop ! stop !
this man is freeborn ! he &apos;s a landowner .
you can &apos;t make a slave of him !
didn &apos;t he refuse to send his men to work in Guy of Gisbourne &apos;s field ?
but I protest-- !
Dickon , follow me ! the rest remain here .
-What &apos;s your name , you Saxon dog ?
-a better one than yours .
look to your manners ! this is Sir Guy of Gisbourne .
sir Guy or the devil ! there &apos;s little to choose between them .
-What &apos;s your name ?
-Much , the miller &apos;s son .
-It &apos;s death to kill the king &apos;s deer .
-And death from hunger if I don &apos;t .
thanks to you and the rest of you Norman cutthroats at Nottingham Castle .
-Be quiet , you .
-I won &apos;t be quiet !
you can kill me if you like , but not until I &apos;ve had my say .
you can beat and starve us Saxons now ...
... but when King Richard escapes , he &apos;ll take you by the scruff of the neck ...
... andflingyouintothesea !
-What the devil ?
-Come now , Sir Guy .
-you &apos;d not kill a man for telling the truth ?
-lf it amused me , yes .
be thankful my humor &apos;s of a different sort .
by what right do you interfere with justice ?
by a better right than you have to misuse it .
that goes for your master , Prince John .
I &apos;ll give him that message at the baron &apos;s meeting in Nottingham tonight .
thank you . he does need a bit of a talking to .
-Eh , Will ?
-He has been getting rather out of hand .
-Fetch him along .
-Hold there . what &apos;s his fault ?
-He &apos;s killed a royal deer .
-you &apos;re wrong . I killed that deer .
this man &apos;s my servant .
I suppose you realize the penalty for killing the king &apos;s deer is death .
-Whether for serf or noble .
-Really ?
are there no exceptions ?
-Thanks , good master .
-Better look before you shoot next time .
from this day , I follow only you .
there isn &apos;t a poor Saxon in Nottingham shire that doesn &apos;t know and bless Sir Robin of Locksley .
take me as your servant .
why , in all the forest , there isn &apos;t a hunter as good as me .
I ask no pay . just to follow you .
fetch the deer , then .
while Richard is bent on adventure in foreign lands ...
... itisourdutyasNormans to preserve the realm ...
... bygivingloyalsupport to Prince John ...
... theonlytruedefender of the Norman spirit .
hail to Prince John .
my lords , I thank you . well , this is what we Normans like :
good food , good company ...
... anda beautifulwoman to flatter me , eh , Lady Marian ?
was it worthwhile coming with me from London ...
... toseewhatstoutfellows our Nottingham friends are ?
take Sir Guy of Gisbourne .
one of our most renowned defenders of the realm .
-Must I take him , Your Highness ?
-Why , you like him , don &apos;t you ?
-Well , he &apos;s a Norman , of course .
-Is that the only reason for liking him ?
isn &apos;t that reason enough for a royal ward who must obey her guardian ?
Oh , nay , I &apos;d not force you , my lady .
but he &apos;s our most powerful friend in these shires and he &apos;s in love with you .
if I could promise him marriage to a royal ward , it might help my plans .
-Perhaps when I know him better .
-Of course .
you &apos;re a very wise young woman .
any more objections to the new tax from our Saxon friends ?
objections , Your Highness ?
with a Saxon dangling from every ... ... gallowstree between here and Charnwood ?
well said , sir knight . but not too many , mind .
else we &apos;ll have nobody left to till our land or pay the tax .
there &apos;s one exception I &apos;d make , Your Highness .
-a certain Saxon noble .
-Who is that ?
-Sir Robin of Locksley .
-Sir Rob- - Sir Robin of Locksley ?
I &apos;ve heard precious little else since I &apos;ve been here .
what &apos;s his latest outrage ?
Oh , nothing less than killing a royal deer in Sherwood Forest today .
and you didn &apos;t take him ?
that would have been a problem , Your Highness .
-a Saxon a problem ?
-He &apos;s a notorious troublemaker , my lady .
Aye . an impudent , reckless rogue ...
... whogoesaroundthe shire stirring up the Saxons against authority .
and he has the insolence to set himself up as a protector of the people .
I could have captured him long ago , but ... .
but what ?
well , he &apos;s the deadliest archer in England , and ... .
and my brave High Sheriff of Nottingham is afraid of him .
I want him taken and hanged . at once , do you hear ?
I &apos;ll not tolerate--
open the door !
who is this , this ... ?
sir Robin of Locksley , Your Highness .
let him approach .
Greetings , Your Highness .
you should teach Gisbourne hospitality .
I no sooner enter his castle doors with a piece of meat ...
... thanhisstarvingservants try to snatch it from me .
you should feed them , Gisbourne . they &apos;ll work better .
with the compliments of your royal brother , King Richard , God bless him !
by my faith , but you &apos;re a bold rascal .
Robin , I like you .
I &apos;m gratified , Your Highness .
I don &apos;t think Gisbourne shares that sentiment , however .
he does look sour .
what &apos;s the matter , Gisbourne ? run out of hangings ?
-I know a ripe subject for one .
-lf you &apos;ll excuse me--
sit down ! sit down , my dear . he &apos;ll not harm you .
sir Robin , this is the Lady Marian Fitzwalter .
I hope my lady had a pleasant journey from London ?
what you hope can hardly be important .
what a pity her manners don &apos;t match her looks , Your Highness .
you hear that , gentlemen ?
here &apos;s Gisbourne so in love with Marian he daren &apos;t say &quot; boo &quot; to her andthissaucyfellow gives her better than she sends .
my lords and ladies , I would like to present to you Sir Robin of Locksley .
sir Robin , permit me to present to you your host , Sir Guy of Gisbourne ...
- ... andournobleguests .
-I &apos;m deeply honored , Your Highness .
-Have you had meat ?
-None but what I brought .
well , sit down . sit down there opposite me .
-Get up , Sir Ivor . give him your place . -Your Highness !
get up ! get up , sir knight !
come , Sir Ivor . out with you .
bring Sir Robin food at once , do you hear ?
such impudence must support a mighty appetite .
true enough , Your Highness .
we Saxons have little to fatten on by the time your tax gatherers are through .
be seated , gentlemen .
no need to stand on ceremony on my account .
so you think you &apos;re overtaxed , eh ?
overtaxed , overworked and paid off with a knife , a club or a rope .
-Why , you speak treason .
-Fluently .
I advise you to curb that wagging tongue of yours !
it &apos;s a habit I &apos;ve never formed .
you know , we Saxons aren &apos;t gonna put up with these oppressions much longer .
Oh , you &apos;re not ? then listen to this :
as you may know , my brother is a prisoner of Leopold of Austria .
and from Leopold , I have received a ransom demand of 1 50,000 gold marks .
that means that you , my friends ...
... mustcollectin taxesnot 2gold marks in the pound , but 3 !
and the money &apos;s to be turned over to me .
why to you , Your Highness ?
King Richard appointed Longchamps regent .
I &apos;ve kicked Longchamps out .
from now on , I am regent of England .
well , confound it , what are you goggling at ?
is it so strange that I decide to rule when my brother &apos;s a prisoner ?
who &apos;s to say I shouldn &apos;t ?
-you , Sir Mortimer of Leeds ?
-Not I , Your Highness .
-you , Sir Boron ?
-Nor I , Your Highness .
-you , Sir Ralf of Durham ?
-My sword is yours , Your Highness .
and what about our young Saxon cockerel here ?
what &apos;s the matter ? have you no stomach for honest meat ?
for honest meat , yes . but I &apos;ve no stomach for traitors .
-you call me traitor ?
-you ? Yes .
and every man here who offers you allegiance .
your Highness .
what do you call a man who takes advantage of a king &apos;s misfortune toseizehispower ?
and now , with the help of this sweet band of cutthroats ...
... you &apos;ll try to grind a ransom for him out of every helpless Saxon .
a ransom that &apos;ll be used not to release Richard ...
... buttobuyyourwaytothe throne .
let me ram those words down his throat , Your Highness !
Oh , no . later . let him spout for the moment .
and what do you propose to do ?
I &apos;ll organize revolt . exact a death for a death .
and I &apos;ll never rest until every Saxon in this shire can stand up , free men ...
... andstrikeablow for Richard and England .
-Have you finished ?
-I &apos;m only just beginning .
from this night on , I use every means in my power to fight you .
Dickon !
such impudence , Your Highness . if I could only reach him .
stand back ! stand back !
open the door !
quick , guards , quick !
there &apos;s a traitor inside trying to escape !
-Shut the door , quick !
-Traitor , sir ?
you infernal idiot ! which way did he go ?
there , through the gate .
-After him !
-Guards ! horses !
Dickon , follow Mansfield ! to your troop !
up you go , quick .
tell Crippen the arrow-maker and his friends ...
... topassthewordtoevery man who &apos;s been beaten or tortured :
the Gallows Oaks in Sherwood tomorrow .
-Yes , master .
have it proclaimed in every village that this Saxon Locksley &apos;s an outlaw .
hang anybody that gives him shelter or aid .
Yes , Your Highness .
his possessions are forfeit to the crown .
Seize his castle and his lands .
everything he owns .
and just to let the people know how the wind has changed ...
- ... thesooneryoubegincollectingthe--
-The ransom , Your Highness ?
Yes , yes , of course . the ransom .
there &apos;s a death sentence for your Robin of Locksley !
I &apos;ll have him dangling in a week .
-I &apos;m tired .
-What ?
after a refreshing sleep in the greenwood ?
I &apos;ve pulled seven acorns out of my ribs .
-Lovely fresh air .
-My teeth ache with chattering .
-Nightingales singing .
-An owl hooting in my ear all night .
hooting ? he was singing you to sleep .
there &apos;s a lusty infant .
he &apos;d be a good one to reason into joining us .
by the look of him , his quarterstaff does his reasoning for him .
-Let &apos;s see what he &apos;s made of .
-It &apos;s your skull , not mine .
-Give way , little man .
-Only to a better man than myself .
he stands before you .
let him pass , Robin .
it &apos;s much too warm to brawl with such a windbag .
when I &apos;ve brushed this fly off , I &apos;ll give you a dusting for good measure .
this fly has a mighty sting , friend .
I &apos;ve only a staff and you threaten me with a longbow and a goose shaft .
-Aren &apos;t you man enough-- ?
-Wait ! I &apos;ll get myself a staff .
-Ready ?
-Yes .
pretty fellow , play a livelier tune that I can make this puny rascal dance to .
you need a merrier tune ? well , how &apos;s this ?
if you want a lesson , you came to the right man !
-Where is he ?
-Who ?
-This quarterstaff master .
-Here .
give my compliments to him .
my friend , I should ask payment for what I &apos;m teaching you here today .
there &apos;s something on account .
there &apos;s your change .
my head hums like a swarm of bees .
what &apos;s your name , friend ?
-John Little . what &apos;s yours ?
-Robin .
-Not Robin of Locksley ?
-Aye .
-Then I &apos;m right glad I fell in with you .
- &apos; Twas he who did the falling in .
I wanted to see what you were made of . and I did .
-I hope you &apos;ll not hold it against me .
-On the contrary .
-I love a man that can best me .
-I &apos;d like to join your company .
you shall .
if you can hold a breach like you held that bridge ...
... you &apos;re one of us . welcome .
-This is Will of Gamwell .
-Yeah .
-He took care not to wet his feathers .
-Just brain over brawn , friend .
you heard Robin &apos;s orders .
look nippy now and spread the word .
&quot; by royal decree , Robin of Locksley isdeclaredan outlaw , condemned to death . &quot;
meet Robin in Sherwood at Gallows Oaks .
&quot; any person aiding him will be hanged . &quot;
meet Robin in Sherwood at Gallows Oaks .
Robin in Sherwood .
at the Gallows Oak .
Robin in Sherwood .
Robin . gallows Oak .
gallows Oak .
I &apos;ve called you here as freeborn Englishmen , loyal to our king .
while he reigned over us we lived in peace .
but since Prince John has seized the regency ...
... GuyofGisbourneand his traitors have murdered and pillaged .
you &apos;ve all suffered from their cruelty .
the ear loppings , the beatings ...
... theblindingswithhot irons , the burning of our homes ...
... themistreatmentof ourwomen .
it &apos;s time we put an end to this !
-Robin &apos;s right .
-Aye !
now , this forest is wide .
it can shelter , clothe and feed a band of good , determined men ...
... goodswordsmen , goodarchers , good fighters !
men , if you &apos;re willing to fight for our people , I want you .
Aye ! Aye !
then kneel and swear this oath .
that you , the freemen of this forest , swear to despoil the rich ...
... onlytogivetothepoor .
to shelter the old and helpless ...
... toprotectallwomen , rich or poor , Norman or Saxon .
swear to fight for a free England .
to protect her loyally until the return of our king and sovereign ...
... RichardtheLion-Heart .
and swear to fight to the death against our oppressors !
we do ! we do solemnly swear !
string him up again !
-He &apos;ll die if we lash him again , my lord .
-Oh , he &apos;ll die , will he ?
another one of their Saxon impudences .
they &apos;ll do anything to trick us .
continue !
-Mercy , good master ! have mercy !
-Start him dancing !
this will teach you to defy Prince John !
father ! father !
stop !
five men dead .
murdered .
sir Ivor , Nigel , Baldwin , Norbert .
-you don &apos;t have to name them .
-Our men can &apos;t lay a hot iron intheeyesofa taxdodgerwithout getting an arrow in the throat .
-He &apos;s got to be stopped !
-Have you tried to stop him ?
Yes , but I couldn &apos;t find him .
what chance has anyone of finding him ?
every villager and woodcutter &apos;s his friend .
every runaway serf and Saxon thief in the shire is joining him .
I &apos;ve sent spies in the forest to find out his hiding place ...
- ... buthestrikes , and gonelike aflash .
-While you stay safely at home .
do you question my valor ?
am I not personally commanding the force ...
... thatgoeswithSir Guy and Lady Marian to Kenworth Castle ...
... toguardthetax moneyheis bringing back , with my sword and my life ?
I only hope this murderer does come out of his hiding place .
you hope !
enough of this wrangling !
I &apos;ll lay this outlaw by the heels when I get back .
well , well . a curtal friar , and a mighty fat one at that .
-He &apos;s the man we need . I &apos;ll enlist him .
-Be careful , Robin .
that &apos;s the friar of Fountain &apos;s Abbey . he &apos;s noted--
Yeah , that &apos;s right . Noted for his piety .
a humble soul , he is , with a heart as gentle as a lamb .
-Be easy with him , master .
-Oh , I won &apos;t harm him .
you stay here lest you frighten him . don &apos;t interfere .
but that friar &apos;s one of the most dangerous swordsmen--
bless my soul , a miracle !
a robber-thief ! give me back my mutton joint !
if you &apos;re a robber you &apos;ll get nothing from me .
I &apos;m a curtal friar and vowed to poverty .
if this is poverty , I &apos;ll gladly share it with you .
that &apos;s what you are doing . give me back my mutton joint !
not so close , my ponderous one .
-I &apos;d have a word with you .
-Well ?
I live in the forest with good fellows ...
... who &apos;ve everything in life save spiritual guidance .
and no merit but one .
-And what &apos;s that ?
-we &apos;re outlaws .
since we &apos;re newborn to the greenwood , we need someone to do our christenings .
-So we &apos;ve chosen you .
-Not I .
they &apos;ve probably all got your taking ways .
of course . but you &apos;ll love them , one and all .
let &apos;s waste no more time .
we &apos;ll take the shortcut across the stream .
-Come .
-I &apos;ll not . I &apos;m happy here .
you will come .
now then , since I don &apos;t care to get my feet wet ...
... you &apos;ll carry me across on your back .
-On my back ?
-Bend ! you must learn obedience .
come on , bend .
on , now !
come on ! on ! on !
come now , fat one . why not give up ?
you can see I &apos;m a better swordsman .
after I let a little air into your bellows you &apos;ll whistle a different tune .
by Our Lady , you &apos;re the fairest swordsman I ever met .
must we go on , then ?
I think we &apos;re even now , friar .
even ? Nay . you &apos;re still ahead of me by half a leg of mutton .
-So--
-No . hold there , friar . enough .
come with me and I &apos;ll promise you the finest venison pasty ...
... andthebiggestyou everate .
beef , boar &apos;s head , casks of ale .
if you &apos;d said that before , you &apos;d have saved us both a wetting .
-you &apos;ll join us ?
-Aye .
if only to convert you from your thieving ways .
you &apos;re Robin Hood , aren &apos;t you ?
the holy henchman !
hail , doubting friar !
-Robin .
-Aye ?
he &apos;s well named Friar Tuck .
it would take half the deer in Sherwood Forest to fill that cavern .
and twice that to fill your empty head .
-Whoa , Will !
-What news , Will ?
-I &apos;ve got word--
-It &apos;s all right .
he &apos;s one of us .
one of us ? he looks like three of us .
Aye . and equal to a full dozen .
now , now , now , now .
friar Tuck , Will Scarlett . what &apos;s it , Will ?
sir Guy of Gisbourne is stopping by the way tonight .
-Has he got the tax money ?
-a fortune !
-When does he enter Sherwood ?
-Tomorrow .
we &apos;ll have to postpone that stuffing match , but it &apos;ll be double tomorrow !
come ! back to camp , men ! here , curb your appetite with that .
-Are you ready , men ?
-Aye .
-See anything of them ?
-Not yet .
is everything ready ?
they &apos;ll think they &apos;ve got into a blooming hornet &apos;s nest .
there they come .
hadn &apos;t we better send out flanking guards ?
what for ?
well , this is Sherwood , you know , and Robin Hood--
-Afraid of that gallows-face ?
-Afraid ? certainly not , sir .
but it &apos;s here that he &apos;s boldest .
don &apos;t worry . we &apos;re more than enough to take care of him .
outlaws have no face to show themselves against armed troops .
are you sure ? I seem to remember--
he jumps out of ambush at small parties , but he wouldn &apos;t dare to attack us .
-Well , you old rooster , what do you see ?
-Make ready . they &apos;re in two sections .
-Do you see Sir Guy ?
-He &apos;s leading the second .
the treasure wagon is with him .
sir Guy and the sheriff are watering their horses .
-The advance guard &apos;s far ahead .
-Good . little John !
take your men and cut off the first section .
you surround the advance guard .
-Ready , men ?
-Aye , Robin !
then stand ready for the signal .
come , Will. come on , let &apos;s welcome Sir Guy .
-Look !
-The guard ! quick !
welcome to Sherwood , my lady .
what , Sir Guy , no greeting from you ? why , that &apos;s curious .
I &apos;ve often heard that you &apos;d give me a warm welcome if ever we met again .
-you &apos;re permitting this without even-- ?
-Fighting ?
-I &apos;m afraid he has no choice , my lady .
-Well , I have , you impudent rascal !
you &apos;re not going to harm my lamb , my honeysuckle .
be still , Bess .
we &apos;ve nothing but peaceful intentions . have we , men ?
we only want to stroke his pretty neck .
-we won &apos;t harm him much .
-you see ?
well , let &apos;s away .
don &apos;t bother to mark the way .
it &apos;ll take keener men than you &apos;ve got ...
- ... tofindourcampagain .
-you &apos;ll hang for this , all of you .
a small price to pay for the company of such a charming lady .
what can a Saxon hedge-robber know of charm ?
or ladies ?
-She means you .
-Me ? a hedge-robber ?
you must tell me more about myself .
you may have been misinformed .
perhaps , but I don &apos;t find it interesting enough to bother about .
you just harm one hair of my lady &apos;s head andthatuglyfaceofyours willwalk about with no neck under it .
now , mind !
-What are you staring at ?
-I ain &apos;t never been out walking ...
- ... witha femalebefore .
-What female ?
-you .
-Well , of all the impudence !
I suppose you say that to all women that tickle your fancy .
I &apos;ve never tickled a woman &apos;s fancy before .
no , I &apos;ve never had a sweetheart .
do you mean to say you never had one single sweetheart in all your life ?
you don &apos;t know what you missed , my lad .
I &apos;ve had the bands on five times .
my lord ! your robes for the feast . hurry up , put them on .
-I won &apos;t !
-you will !
I will ! I will !
to them , this is heaven .
silks for rags , kindness instead of riches , limitless food instead of hunger .
-Why , they &apos;re actually happy .
-Are they ?
aren &apos;t you even a little pleased to see them enjoying themselves ?
I think it &apos;s revolting .
your life &apos;s been very sheltered , hasn &apos;t it , my lady ?
too sheltered , perhaps .
but if you could know these people as I know them .
their patience , loyalty , goodness .
friar Tuck ! these should fit Sir Guy .
me lord . here is your raiment for the banquet .
when you &apos;ve done with them , give them to Prince John .
to the tables , everybody , and stuff yourselves !
may I serve you , my lady ?
I &apos;m afraid the company has spoiled my appetite .
misfortune . now , mine is excellent .
-a little mutton , my lady ?
-I said I &apos;m not hungry .
why , so you did . I &apos;d forgotten .
well , you will let me know if you regain your appetite , won &apos;t you ?
friends ! friends !
I &apos;d supposed , with you , that this Sir Guy of Gisbourne was a scurvy fellow ...
... anda bitterenemyofours . and yet , look !
he provides us with this tasty supper .
and is this the end of his beneficence ? why , no !
for in his train today ...
... he &apos;s brought us half a score of boxes full of jewels and silks ...
... andmore , about30,000goldenmarks wrested from the northern shires .
-you wouldn &apos;t dare .
-Sit down !
some of you might think our host ...
... intendedthistreasure for the coffers of Prince John ...
... insteadofto ransomthe king . and you would be right .
but a strange thing happened .
a change of heart overtook him in the forest , and there it is , safe and sound !
-you speak of loyalty .
-Yes . why not ?
I suppose you and your cutthroats intend to send this treasure to Richard ?
you wouldn &apos;t dream of keeping it yourselves .
friends ! what shall we do with this treasure ?
divide it amongst ourselves ?
-Hold it for Richard !
-It belongs to the king !
-Convinced ?
-I may have been hasty ... .
but why you , a knight ...
... shouldliveherelikeananimal , robbing , killing , outlawed ... ?
are you really interested in learning why I turned outlaw ?
or are you afraid of the truth ? or of me , perhaps ?
-I &apos;m afraid of nothing . least of all of you .
-Good . then come with me .
Oh , so you are afraid .
-Well , men .
-Hi !
hardly an inspiring sight for such pretty eyes as yours , I &apos;m sure .
but these poor devils have all had their homes burned .
their families beaten and starved to death by your tax gatherers .
-Bless you . we &apos;ll never forget you .
-Our humble thanks , master .
-May we be worthy , Robin .
-you are , mother , you are .
-Have you eaten well , friend ?
-Yes , thank you , Robin Hood .
we humbly thank you , master .
I &apos;m sorry to have to show you that .
but once these poor people were happy and contented .
just simple villagers who never harmed a soul .
and now ... .
tortured , eyesput out , tongues slit , ears hacked off .
they come to me for protection against your Norman friends .
but you &apos;ve taken Norman lives .
Yes , those that deserved it . the cruel and unjust .
you &apos;re a strange man .
strange ? because I can feel for beaten , helpless people ?
no , you &apos;re strange because you want to do something about it .
you &apos;re willing to defy Sir Guy , even Prince John himself .
to risk your own life .
-And one of those men was a Norman .
-Norman or Saxon . what &apos;s that matter ?
-It &apos;s injustice I hate , not the Normans .
-But it &apos;s lost you your rank , your lands .
it &apos;s made you a hunted outlaw whenyoumighthave lived in comfort and security .
what &apos;s your reward for all this ?
reward ? you just don &apos;t understand , do you ?
I &apos;m sorry .
I do begin to see a little now .
if you do , then that &apos;s reward enough .
now that you &apos;ve robbed us and had your fill of insulting us , we wish to leave .
-Come , Lady Marian .
-My men will escort my lady .
but before you leave , it might be well if you thanked her for saving your life .
my life ?
do you think you would have left this forest alive ...
... if it hadn &apos;t been for her presence here ?
-Peter ! Harold !
-Yes , master ?
take six men and guide our loyal host and his nervous friend ...
- ... totheNottinghamRoad .
-But our horses , our clothes .
you &apos;ll return to Nottingham as you are , on foot .
this , Sir Guy , will at least be a lesson to you in humility , if not in mercy .
-Your people will be returned tomorrow .
-But the Lady Marian .
you &apos;d best be started before I have a change of mind .
I think we &apos;d better go .
now , my lady .
friar Tuck ! little John !
take the lady to the Abbey of the Black Canons ...
... sotomorrowthebishop can give her escort the rest of the way .
-May I go too ?
-With your permission , my lady ?
Goodbye , my lady .
Goodbye .
-He took everything you had collected ?
-Every silver penny .
and you two nincompoops sat there and let him do it .
-Oh , we resisted as well as we could .
-Where are your wounds ? your bruises ?
-And where are your men ?
-What did Your Highness expect ?
with the Lady Marian in our company and Locksley &apos;s men outnumbering us .
and not an arrow wound to divide among them , I suppose .
and more than 30,000 marks in the hands of that wolf &apos;s head .
that fellow &apos;s got to be taken . understand ?
and how does Your Highness suggest that he be taken ?
-lf I may be so bold as to inquire ?
-Mind your words , Gisbourne .
you &apos;re fortunate not to be paying for this with your head .
your Highness , sir , I could muster an army and surround Sherwood .
-you couldn &apos;t capture him ...
-you mind your words .
... ifhesatinyour lap shooting arrows at a crow .
arrows !
-He said shooting arrows at a crow .
-Take that silly looking bonnet off .
that stirs something in my mind .
perhaps we can &apos;t take him by force .
he &apos;s too well protected .
knows Sherwood &apos;s hidden paths well . but--
-But what ?
-we &apos;ll outwit him .
we &apos;ll hold an archery tournament !
archery tour--
and have him fly in on the end of one of his own arrows ?
that &apos;s marvelous .
he &apos;s the finest archer in the North .
think he &apos;d forgo shooting againstthearchersofallEngland ?
we &apos;ll give a prize . say , a golden arrow .
and ask him to risk his neck for that ?
that won &apos;t be the only bait , with the Lady Marian presenting the arrow herself .
what do you mean ?
when they came out of the forest , she seemed very friendly .
and didn &apos;t you notice how his eyes never left her ?
-Yes , yes , I noticed .
-Well , then !
-Well , then , how do we get word to him ?
-Get word to Robin ...
... whohasan eyeineverybush and ears in every wall ?
but even if he comes , won &apos;t he be disguised ?
whether he be dressed as priest , beggar , knight ...
... palmer , whatdisguisecan conceal the finest archer in England ?
the man who wins the golden arrow will be Robin Hood .
will you take that bonnet off ?
I hope our little golden hook will catch the fish .
-you hope ?
-Oh , it will if he &apos;s here .
if he &apos;s not , we &apos;ll stick your head upon the target and shoot at that .
-Are your men sure of their orders ?
-Yes .
they &apos;re stationed all around the field .
even a worm couldn &apos;t get through .
you talk as if this were a trap .
no , my dear .
just a precaution in case the Saxons create a disturbance .
by orders of His Highness Prince John ...
... thechampions of Sir Guy and the knights ...
... willbelimitedtothreeflights of arrows for the eliminations .
the winning team will meet all comers .
-you know it &apos;s a trap .
-a golden arrow , from the lady herself .
-They &apos;ve cooked this up to take you .
-Well , what of it ?
-you know what &apos;ll happen if they do .
-Where &apos;s your sporting blood ?
sir Guy accepted our invitation . we &apos;d be rude not to accept his .
-It &apos;d be ruder to get your neck stretched .
-There , my band getting fat and overfed .
where &apos;s your love of fights , risk , adventure ?
since our friend seems to have gone a little mad , I &apos;ll have to see him through .
we &apos;ll have to see him through .
prepare final flight .
does my lady find it interesting ? lady Marian ?
-Oh , I &apos;m sorry .
-I asked if you found it interesting .
Yes , very . they &apos;re splendid archers .
you &apos;ll find it much more interesting later on .
the winning team will compete as individuals .
Captain Phillip of Arras .
Elwyn the Welshman . Matt of Sleaford .
they now challenge all comers .
the men who &apos;d shoot against that lot have to have the eyes of a falcon .
they &apos;re far too good for me . I &apos;m not shooting today .
remaining archers will use center target .
Matt of Sleaford , out !
Elwyn the Welshman , out !
-The tall tinker .
-Now is the time .
not so hasty , Sir Guy . I &apos;m enjoying myself .
let them finish the match .
-But he could--
-Have your men close in if you wish .
look .
Yeah , they &apos;re closing in . I hope Robin sees them .
I must commend Your Highness for the subtlety of your scheme .
very good . would you say you &apos;d seen that tall fellow before ?
and if I had , what interest could a tinker have for me ?
Phillip of Arras shoots next .
tie ! you will be allowed another flight .
target &apos;s a deal too close. can we have it removed to a fit distance to shoot at ?
another 20 paces !
if your archer captain wins at that distance ...
... I &apos;ll give you 1 000 gold marks for him .
win or lose , I &apos;ll give him to Your Highness for a favor .
provided you let me deal with this wolf &apos;s head in my own way .
done .
I &apos;m leaving for Norwich right after the tournament anyway ...
... soyoumaydowhat youplease with him .
why , he can &apos;t win now . no living man could beat that shot .
I &apos;ll wager 1 00 marks on Phillip of Arras !
he split Phillip &apos;s arrow .
the tinker wins ! he wins !
-What is your name , archer ?
-Godfrey of Sherwood , Your Highness .
how is it that a tinker learned so well the use of arms ?
even a peaceful tinker ...
... mustprotecthimselfthesedays from treachery and other things .
it &apos;s earned you more than you bargained for today .
I pronounce you champion archer of England .
from the gracious hand of Lady Marian Fitzwalter , you &apos;ll receive your reward .
advance .
I ... .
Hereis yourprize , sirarcher .
it &apos;s indeed an honor to receive it from the hands of so beautiful a lady .
-How is it you didn &apos;t use a black arrow ?
-That &apos;s my court of last resort , Sir Guy .
-Its verdict is always final .
-Arrest this man !
that &apos;s a good idea .
you &apos;re a very rash young man .
and I &apos;m sorry I can &apos;t be in Nottingham to see what Gisbourne has in store for you .
-It &apos;ll be something special , I &apos;m sure .
-I &apos;m sure .
sorry I underestimated you . next time perhaps--
there &apos;ll be no next time . take him away !
&quot; Robin of Locksley . known to some as the outlaw Robin Hood .
after trial , in which you did not produce one witness in your behalf ...
... you &apos;ve been found guilty of outlawry , theft , murder , abduction ...
... falsepretenses , contempt of the Crown ...
... poachinginroyalforests and high treason . &quot;
haven &apos;t you forgotten a count or two ?
surely it &apos;s a crime under the noble Prince John to love one &apos;s country .
to protect serfs from injustice and be loyal to one &apos;s king .
if I could add anything to the charges against you , I would most gladly do so .
&quot; it is the sentence of this tribunal , that on the morrow at noon you be taken ...
... tothesquareinNottinghamandthere hanged by the neck until you are dead . &quot;
there may be some who will regret that a man of your peculiar talents ...
... shouldbecutoff soearlyinlife . but personally--
you think the sentence extremely lenient . thank you .
what &apos;s troubling you , my lady ? is it the outlaw ?
Yes . I hate to see a human being trapped ... .
Bess , you know where his men may be found , don &apos;t you ?
-Why , my lady , how should I know ?
-Don &apos;t put me off .
that little man who liked you . you &apos;ve been seeing him ?
-Yes , my lady .
-Tell me where .
-Do you want to send a message ?
-To his men , yes .
well , my lady , I have had a nip of ale of a night , just now and again ...
... at a place in the town and I won &apos;t deny as some of the others were there .
where was it ? Oh , Bess , please tell me !
it was a tavern , my lady .
the Saracen &apos;s Head in Pilgrim court .
-The landlord &apos;s name is Humility Prin .
-Humility Prin .
knock at the door and say , &quot; A Locksley . &quot;
- &quot; A Locksley . &quot;
-Yes , but--
get me a cloak , quickly !
Yes , madame . Oh , dear ... .
-But there must be some way-- -couldn &apos;t we storm the place ?
why , you &apos;d need an army with a battering ram to even dent it .
Aye , he &apos;ll be hanged for sure .
maybe Little John &apos;s right . perhaps we should--
a Locksley .
-What is it , Prin ?
-a lady , sir . the Lady Marian .
-What ?
-It &apos;s a trap , Will . watch those windows .
she has the password , all right .
-Is she alone ?
-Yes , sir .
fetch her in .
-What do you want , my lady ?
-I want to help him .
-How did you find us here ?
-Never mind that now .
please don &apos;t stand there staring . tell me what I can do .
-Don &apos;t trust her . it &apos;s a Norman trick .
-Would I come alone if it were a trap ?
what &apos;s to prevent your killing me if-- ?
is there no one here with sense enough to see ?
one moment .
we have to make sure , my child .
you &apos;re a good daughter of the church ?
you swear by Our Lady that you want to help Robin ?
I swear , good Father .
-Have you thought of a way ?
-Yes .
-Can you get us in the castle ?
-That &apos;s no good . he &apos;s heavily guarded .
but I thought of another way . listen .
-This is a rare treat , isn &apos;t it , my lady ?
-Yes , isn &apos;t it ?
with Locksley out of the way , we &apos;ll stamp out the rest .
won &apos;t it be a pleasant surprise for Prince John when he returns ?
to think that I was once foolish enough to believe that you rather liked him .
why , your hand is trembling .
take him to the gallows .
take him up there .
he &apos;ll not be so insolent when they &apos;ve stretched his neck .
get ready .
stop him !
stop ! guards !
friar Tuck ! much !
-Here we are , sir !
-Here we are , safe and sound !
back to camp !
Robin ! where are you ?
here I am . stand by !
he is different from anyone I &apos;ve ever known .
he &apos;s , well , he &apos;s brave and he &apos;s reckless , and yet he &apos;s gentle and kind .
he &apos;s not brutal like ... .
tell me , when you are in love , is it ...
... well , isit hardtothinkofanybody but one person ?
Yes , indeed , and sometimes there &apos;s a bit of trouble sleeping .
I know , but it &apos;s a nice kind of not sleeping .
Yes , and it affects your appetite too .
not that I &apos;ve noticed it &apos;s done that to you exceptwhenhe was waiting to be hanged .
does it make you want to be with him all the time ?
Yes . and when he &apos;s with you , your legs are weak as water .
tell me , my lady , when he looks at you , do you feel a kind of prickly feeling ...
... likegoosypimplesrunning all up and down your spine ?
-Then there &apos;s not a doubt of it .
-Doubt of what ?
that you &apos;re in love !
what do you want ?
Robin !
-I must say . I must say !
-Keep quiet , Bess .
are you completely mad ?
-Why did you come here ?
-To see you .
but don &apos;t you realize that-- ?
my men told me what you did for me , so I &apos;ve come to thank you .
and after what I couldn &apos;t help overhearing about that prickly feeling ...
... I &apos;m very glad I did come .
that was a game . now , you &apos;ve got to go at once !
a game ? well , couldn &apos;t I join in ?
of course , I probably wouldn &apos;t be as good at it as this pretty young girl .
but I could do my best .
Bess , will you leave us ?
please !
now , let &apos;s see , where does this game begin ?
Oh , I know . it &apos;s simple .
we &apos;ll start where you &apos;re in love with me .
you are , aren &apos;t you ? because I am with you , terribly .
that &apos;s why I came . I had to see you again .
you must go at once . and I don &apos;t love you .
-Oh ! are you sure ?
-Yes .
very well then , I &apos;ll go .
this is rather unfriendly of you , exposing me to my enemies like this .
let me see .
there &apos;s a fat old captain of the guard down there with bow legs .
if I drop on him that &apos;ll bend them out worse .
an archer ! he &apos;s too thin . I might miss him altogether .
-Robin !
-The very thing .
five men-at-arms in a group .
they &apos;ll break the fall beautifully .
-Goodbye , my lady !
-Robin !
-Yes ?
-Please .
then you do love me ? don &apos;t you ?
-Don &apos;t you ?
-you know I do .
well , that &apos;s different .
-Do you know you &apos;re very impudent ?
-Me ?
you are !
when my guardian , King Richard , finds out about your being in love with me--
-I know , he &apos;ll make me court jester .
-He won &apos;t !
he &apos;ll stick your funny head on London Gate .
and a fine decoration it will be , my bold Norman beauty .
-I &apos;m not bold .
-Well , you &apos;re Norman .
well , I don &apos;t hold that against you . and you are a beauty .
-you &apos;re the most beautiful--
-you &apos;re leaving at once .
please , darling , every minute you &apos;re here you &apos;re in danger .
I &apos;ll go .
-Marian , will you come with me ?
-To Sherwood ?
I &apos;ve nothing to offer you but a life of hardship and danger ...
... but we &apos;d be together .
-But , Robin , dear--
-It &apos;s asking a lot , but who knows how long it &apos;ll be before Richard returns .
friar Tuck could marry us . will you ?
because I love you , Robin , I &apos;d come .
even the danger would mean nothing if you were with me .
then you will ?
no . listen to me , darling .
you remember that day in Sherwood Forest ?
I realized then for the first time that what you were doing was right ...
... andthatwe werewrong .
no , let me finish .
you taught me England is bigger than Normans and Saxons ...
... fightingandhatingeachother .
that it belongs to all of us , to live peacefully together ...
... Ioyalonlyto Richardand toEngland .
but , darling , you could help .
I could help much more by watching for treachery here ...
... andleavingyoufreetoprotect Richard &apos;s people until he returns .
now do you see why you have to go back to your men alone ?
go now , quickly , dearest .
-Goodbye , darling .
-Goodbye .
-Goodbye , my love .
-Goodbye .
-you gentlemen have traveled far ?
-Yes , quite a distance .
I &apos;m sorry I can &apos;t give you better food .
-There is little left to us these days .
-This will be enough .
the inn at Luton was well supplied . how is that ?
that &apos;s a Norman inn .
but it &apos;s an outrage ! I &apos;ll complain to Prince John .
I &apos;ll have this rascal &apos;s ears , no matter how .
dares to rob me !
strip my person of jewels !
what &apos;s this country coming to whena highchurchman can &apos;t travel the forest in safety ?
-Who &apos;s he ?
-The Bishop of the Black Canons .
-Do you wish to go on after dinner ?
-No . we can &apos;t reach the abbey tonight .
-I &apos;ll stay . tend to the horses .
-Yes , Your Grace .
-Bring food to us !
-Yes , Your Grace , at once !
it &apos;s no longer safe to journey anywhere .
robbers at every turn of the road .
-What happened , Your Grace ?
-I told you ! we &apos;ve been robbed .
not a chance to defend ourselves .
they burst on us from ambush .
-Who did ?
-Why , Robin Hood , of course .
there &apos;s no other with impudence enough .
Robin Hood again , sire .
-you &apos;ve heard of him , then ?
-Oh , he seems well known hereabouts .
-Oh , then you &apos;re strange to this shire ?
-More or less .
what might be your names , gentlemen ?
we &apos;re hardly important enough to deserve your interest .
-Landlord , where &apos;s our ale ?
-Coming , sirs .
will you gentlemen be remaining here tonight ?
we hadn &apos;t decided , Your Grace . what would you advise ?
well , there &apos;s so much danger on the road , you &apos;d be far safer here .
we will then , since we &apos;ll have the added pleasure of your company .
I should like to stay , but I recollected some urgent affairs at my abbey .
some other time , or perhaps you would break your journey ...
- ... andsupwithmetomorrow .
-Your Grace is too kind .
then I bid you good evening , gentlemen , and God speed you in the morning .
thank you . good night .
the window !
are there beds prepared , landlord ?
let &apos;s to sleep , then . I &apos;m tired .
-I &apos;m afraid he suspects , sire .
-I fear so .
his Grace is a Norman .
did you see the fear on the landlord &apos;s face when he came in ?
I &apos;ve seen it in the faces of thousands since we returned .
I ought never to have left England .
I noticed when Robin Hood &apos;s name is mentioned--
the mysterious outlaw whom we have sought .
in vain .
however , the bishop didn &apos;t have any difficulty meeting him .
which gives me an idea .
-And you &apos;re sure it was Richard ?
-No doubt of it .
how like my dear brother this is !
he couldn &apos;t rot in Durnstein like any decent man .
-But Richard has no army .
-No , Your Highness .
-lf he had , we should have heard of it .
-lf my brother happened to be killed--
-England would have a new king .
-That would be murder ! I &apos;ll have no part--
you &apos;ll do as you &apos;re told ! that &apos;s very simple .
keep your mouth closed .
your Highness , I beg of you !
how long will you retain your abbey if Richard survives to find out ...
... what you &apos;ve been up to these years he &apos;s been away ?
go on , Gisbourne . who &apos;s to ... ?
Dickon was a knight before your brother hacked off his spurs ...
... oversomelittlemischance .
there &apos;s nothing he wouldn &apos;t do for a king who &apos;d restore him to rank .
-you don &apos;t love my brother , I hear .
-I have little reason to , Your Highness .
-you know this tavern ?
-Yes .
if Richard dies--
Dickon returns to the roll of English knights .
am I not right ?
with the manor and estate of Robin of Locksley to support his rank .
-When shall I start ? -Now .
how many men will you need ?
I shall do it better alone , Your Highness .
the sooner you &apos;re crowned king--
the better for my friends ? you &apos;re a clever fellow , Gisbourne .
thank you , Your Majesty .
return to your abbey and make preparations to proclaim me king ...
... hereinNottingham , the day after tomorrow .
do you suppose she heard ?
I don &apos;t know .
now you know why Robin &apos;s got to find King Richard at once and warn him .
take this note to Much at Saracen &apos;s Head .
my lady &apos;s hearing is a little defective tonight .
when you knock at a lady &apos;s door as if it were a tavern , you deserve to wait .
you seem upset .
upset ? why should I be ?
Oh , come now , my dear Lady Marian .
you &apos;ve played the innocent long enough .
-Let &apos;s be frank with one another .
-I don &apos;t see the need .
you &apos;re charming , but not exactly clever .
you couldn &apos;t have failed tooverhearwhatPrinceJohn and I were talking about .
Oh , no , no , no . please don &apos;t trouble to deny it .
and your first thought , as Richard &apos;s loyal ward , was to warn him .
-Am I not right ?
-Why , how could I warn Richard ?
how did Locksley and his men arrange his escape ...
... fromhangingafterthe archerymatch ?
someone here in the castle must have got word to him .
that &apos;s ridiculous !
when Richard &apos;s in danger , what more natural ...
... thanthatyoushouldtry to warn him through Locksley ?
and you do intend to warn him , don &apos;t you ?
-Don &apos;t you ?
-No !
if that &apos;s true , perhaps you &apos;d explain before Prince John andtheCourtofExecution the meaning of this .
guard !
escort my Lady Marian to the Great Hall .
not only has she consorted with this Saxon rebel ...
... foundguiltyof outlawry , theft , murder , abduction and high treason ...
... butshehasbetrayed her own Norman people .
are you not ashamed , my Lady Marian ?
Yes , I am . bitterly .
but it &apos;s a shame that I &apos;m a Norman afterseeingthethingsmyfellow countrymen have done to England .
at first I wouldn &apos;t believe .
because I was a Norman I wouldn &apos;t let myself believe thatthehorrorsyou inflicted on the Saxons weren &apos;t just .
I know now why you tried so hard to kill this outlaw whom you despised .
it &apos;s because he was the one man in England who protected the helpless ...
... againstbeasts who were drunk on human blood !
and now you intend to murder your own brother !
you &apos;ll be sorry you interfered .
sorry ? I &apos;d do it again if you kill me for it .
a prophetic speech , my lady , for that is exactly what is going to happen to you .
you wouldn &apos;t dare .
I &apos;m the royal ward of King Richard and no one but the king himself ...
... hastherighttocondemnmetodeath .
you are quite right , my dear .
and it shall be a king who will order your execution for high treason ...
... exactly48hoursfromnow .
take her away .
-you got it all in your stupid head now ?
-Of course I have .
well , give Robin the whole message exactly like I told it to you .
Bess , where was Dickon supposed to find King Richard ?
Oh , never mind him !
what do I care about your kings and thrones and such ?
Robin has gotta do something to save my baby !
come on , old girl . Robin will look after her , all right .
-Where &apos;s Dickon heading for ?
-Kent Road Tavern .
Kent Road Tavern ?
you can save three miles and cut him off through Low Wood .
come on , lass , give us a kiss and wish me luck .
hurry up and take your ugly face out of here .
Oh , Much . Oh , you will be careful , won &apos;t you ?
of course I will .
Greetings , sir abbot !
-you &apos;ve traveled far this morning ?
-Too far to be patient with delay now .
perhaps it &apos;s the weight of your purse that wearies you .
I can remedy that .
if it weighs more than a just amount I &apos;ll share it with those who have less .
you think I hand my purse to every rough lout who asks for it ?
you see , sir abbot ?
we &apos;re poor outlaws , with nothing to eat but the king &apos;s deer whileyouhaveproperty , rents , and silver .
I &apos;ve traveled far on the king &apos;s business and the silver I have left ...
... equalsnomorethan60marks .
what ? are you friendly to our good King Richard ?
I love no man better .
by that speech you save half your money .
give me 30 marks for the poor and the rest you may keep .
then I can go free ?
any friend of Richard &apos;s is free of this forest .
would you honor us by sharing meat with us ?
-Gladly .
-Then come .
-Well , sir rascal , tell me , who are you ?
-I &apos;m called Robin Hood .
it seems I &apos;ve heard of you .
-Nothing good , I hope .
-Oh , now I remember !
how does your loyalty to Richard set on a killer of knights ...
... a poacher of the king &apos;s deer and an outlaw ?
those I kill died from misusing the trust that Richard left them .
and the worst rogue of these is the king &apos;s own brother .
-Oh , then you blame Prince John .
-No , I blame Richard .
his task was defending his people ...
... insteadofdesertingthem to fight in foreign lands .
what ? you &apos;d condemn Holy crusades ?
I &apos;ll condemn anything that leaves the task of holding England ...
much !
-Much , what &apos;s happened to you ?
-Take me to Robin , quick !
-Much , what &apos;s happened ?
-King Richard &apos;s in England . in Sherwood !
what ?
Prince John sent Dickon to Kent Road Tavern last night to kill the king .
-Take 50 men to the Kent Road Tavern--
-No need , master , no need .
I headed Dickon off . he ain &apos;t gonna murder no one no more .
-But the king ? where is he ?
-I don &apos;t know , master .
men , Richard must be found .
he must be brought here for safety .
little John , take a party and scour the country .
friar Tuck , into the town .
will , search every inn and cottage .
don &apos;t rest , day or night , until he &apos;s found .
understand ?
you don &apos;t need to search for Richard , Robin .
-He &apos;s in good hands . the best in England .
-What do you mean ? where is he ?
here !
sire .
all these have remained loyal .
rise , Sir Robin .
rise , men of Sherwood .
sire , Prince John &apos;s calling Bishop of the Black Canons ...
... toproclaimhimking in Nottingham tomorrow .
-How &apos;d you learn this ?
-Lady Marian . she overheard .
they &apos;ve taken her for treason .
she &apos;s been condemned to the block for warning us .
he wouldn &apos;t dare execute the king &apos;s ward .
you underestimate him .
if we &apos;re to save her and your throne , we &apos;ve got to act now !
by attacking Nottingham castle ?
without an army it &apos;ll be much too strong .
your men will be killed .
if the Bishop of the Black Canons is performing the ceremony tomorrow ...
... supposewevisithim at his abbey tonight ... ... andpersuadehimtosuggestaway .
brace up . smile !
wider !
still sure it wasn &apos;t you who warned my brother I was in England ?
why , sire , believe me , l--
your Grace , smile !
you &apos;ll sweat the lard off that fat carcass of yours ...
... before this day &apos;s over , my pudgy friend .
and I hope some Norman sword whittles you down to size !
Oh , Lord , we beseech thee .
Sanctify this thy servant , our royal Prince John .
Enrich his noble heart and bestow upon him all princely virtues .
amen .
no news of Richard .
no . none , Your Highness .
then Dickon must have--
sir Dickon , Your Highness .
of course . of course .
we are ready for the ceremony , Your Majesty .
remember .
by what authority do you , John Lackland , Prince of England ...
... claimtobe crownedthisday , sovereign of the realm ...
... andasdefenderoftheHolySepulcher , to receive the blessing of the church ?
by right of blood succession . according to the law of the realm .
is it of your own free will that you thus depose your brother ...
... RichardtheLion-HeartofEngland ?
Richard no longer exists !
from this moment forward , I , John , am king of England !
aren &apos;t you a little premature , brother ?
Richard ! the Lion-Heart !
he &apos;s lying ! he &apos;s an imposter !
-The king lives !
-Men of Sherwood !
Robin Hood !
it &apos;s a trick of the outlaws ! kill him ! Seize him !
did I upset your plans ?
you &apos;ve come to Nottingham once too often !
when this is over , there &apos;ll be no need for me to come again .
your sword , Gisbourne .
-Know any prayers , my friend ?
-I &apos;ll say one for you !
save yourself , Robin !
the door , quick ! quick , or I &apos;ll trim that beard for you !
but , Richard , Richard ! I thought--
-you thought I was murdered !
-Oh , no , no .
I didn &apos;t mean to ... .
after all , Richard , I am your brother .
Yes , sire , he is your brother .
Yes , my brother .
I could forgive you if your treachery were against me and not my subjects .
I banish you and your followers from England for the remainder of my lifetime .
take them away . see that they leave England .
I further banish from my realm all injustices and oppressions ...
... whichhaveburdenedmypeople .
and I pray that under my rule ...
... NormansandSaxonsalike will share the rights of Englishmen .
long live Richard the Lion-Heart !
what about you , Robin ?
my sword is yours , sire , now and always .
is there nothing the king can grant the outlaw ...
... whoshowedhim his duty to his country ?
Yes , Your Majesty , a pardon for the men of Sherwood .
granted with all my heart .
long live Richard the Lion-Heart !
but is there nothing for yourself ?
there &apos;s but one thing else , sire .
and do you too wish ... ?
more than anything in the world , sire .
kneel , Robin Hood .
Arise , Robin , Baron of Locksley , Earl of Sherwood and Nottingham ...
... andlordof allthe landsandmanors appertaining thereto .
my first command to you , my lord earl ...
... istotakeinmarriage the hand of the Lady Marian .
long live Robin Hood ! long live Robin Hood !
long live Lady Marian !
and what say you to that , Baron of Locksley ?
may I obey all your commands with equal pleasure , sire !
Hello .
- What &apos;s all this fuss about , Charters ?
- I &apos;m hanged if I know .
Danke schön . Danke schön .
ladies and gentlemen , I &apos;m very sorry .
the train is little bit uphold .
and if you wish to stay in my hotel , you have to register immediately .
why the deuce didn &apos;t he say so in the first place ?
Ah .
Oh , how do you do , Miss Henderson ? how do you do , ladies ?
- It &apos;s a great honor to have you with us again .
- Nice to see you too , Boris .
- You haven &apos;t changed a bit since last Friday .
- I see you haven &apos;t shaved either .
- Is everything ready ?
- Everything is ready . I didn &apos;t change anything .
not even the sheets . we know . lead on , Boris .
you see , I didn &apos;t expect you to come so quickly .
- Well , our legs gave out on us .
- That &apos;s odd .
- We had to do the last lap in a farm cart .
- Oh !
I see we &apos;ve got company .
don &apos;t tell me Cook &apos;s are running cheap tours here .
- What is it , Boris ?
- It &apos;s the avalanche .
- Avalanche ?
- Avalanche , Boris . avalanche .
you see , in the spring we &apos;ve got many avalanches .
you know , - bloop !
and everything disappear . even train disappear under the avalanche .
but I &apos;m going home tomorrow . how long before they dig it out ?
by morning . it &apos;s lucky for you .
you can leave by this train instead of your own .
how you said it ? is a bad wind that blow nowhere no good .
talking of wind , we haven &apos;t eaten since dawn .
- Serve us some supper , Boris , in our room .
- I could eat a horse .
- Don &apos;t put ideas into his head . uh , some chicken , Boris .
- Yes .
- And a magnum of champagne .
- Absolutely .
- And make it snappy .
- Bandrika may have a dictator , but tonight we &apos;re painting it red .
Meanwhile we have to stand here cooling our heels , I suppose , eh ?
Confounded impudence .
Oh , third-rate country . what do you expect ?
- Wonder who all those women were . - Hmm .
possibly Americans , I should think .
- You know , almighty dollar , old man .
- I suppose we &apos;ll have to wait here .
if only we hadn &apos;t missed that train at Budapest .
I don &apos;t want to rub it in , but if you hadn &apos;t insisted ... on standing up until they finished their national anthem -
Yes , but you must show respect , Caldicott .
if I &apos;d known it was going to last 20 minutes -
well , it &apos;s always been my contention that The Hungarian Rhapsody ... is not their national anthem .
- In any case , we were the only two standing .
- That &apos;s true .
- Well , I suppose we shall be in time after all .
- I doubt it .
that last report was pretty ghastly .
do you remember ? &quot; England on the brink . &quot;
Yes , but that &apos;s newspaper sensationalism .
- The old country &apos;s been in some tight corners before .
- It looks pretty black .
even if we get away first thing tomorrow morning , there &apos;s still the connection at B ♪ öâle .
- We &apos;ll probably be hours . - Mmm , that &apos;s true .
well , somebody surely can help us . Oh , sir .
would you happen to know what time the train leaves Bâle for England ?
Oh . really ?
fella doesn &apos;t speak English .
Hello ? Alex .
champagne . Miss Henderson .
monsieur .
- Here &apos;s one leaves Bâle 21 : 20 .
- 21 : 20 ?
- Yeah .
- Twenty . Twenty . Twelve from 21 is -
- Twenty-one -
- Eleven . no . Yes .
I regret , sir , there is only left two single room in front ... or a little double room at the back .
- We &apos;ll , uh , take the two singles .
- Very well , sir . here is .
- Thank you .
- Thank you .
at least you might have asked me which I preferred .
my dear , a small double room at the back in a place like this -
you weren &apos;t so particular in Paris last autumn .
it was quite different then . the exhibition was at its height .
I realize that now . there &apos;s no need to rub it in .
- We want a private suite with a bath .
- Facing the mountain .
- Yes .
- With a shower , of course .
- Hot and cold .
- A private thingummy if you &apos;ve got one .
sorry , gentlemen .
the only things I &apos;ve got is the maid &apos;s room .
- The what ?
- Maid &apos;s room ?
I &apos;m sorry . the whole hotel is packed . jammed to the sky .
that &apos;s impossible . we haven &apos;t fixed up yet .
you can &apos;t expect to put the two of us up in the maid &apos;s room .
well , don &apos;t get excited . I &apos;ll remove the maid out .
Yes , I should think so . what ? what are you talking about ?
- I think I &apos;d sooner sleep on the train .
- Would you ?
- There is no &apos; eating on the train .
- No eating on the train ?
Yes . I mean - Heating .
- Heating . there &apos;s no heating on the train .
- That &apos;s awkward .
- all right . we &apos;ll take it .
- Just a minute . with one condition .
you have to have the maid comes to your room , remove her wardrobe .
Anna .
she &apos;s a good girl , and I don &apos;t want to lose her .
we &apos;d better go and dress .
- Rather primitive humor , I hope .
- Grown-up children , you know .
that was rather an awkward situation over that girl .
- Pity he couldn &apos;t have given us one each .
- Eh ?
- I mean , uh , a room apiece .
- Oh .
I , Iris Matilda Henderson ... a spinster of no particular parish ... do hereby solemnly renounce my maidenly past ... and do declare that on Thursday next , the 26th inst . , being in my right mind ...
I shall take the veil and the orange blossom ... and change my name to Lady Charles Fotheringail .
can &apos;t you get him to change his name instead ?
the only thing I like about him is his mustache .
you &apos;re a couple of cynics . I &apos;m very fond of him .
well , I &apos;m fond of rabbits , but they have to be kept down .
Rudolph , give me a hand .
have you ever read about that little thing called love ?
it used to be very popular .
child , the carpet is already laid at St. George &apos;s , Hanover Square .
and Father &apos;s simply aching to have a coat of arms on the jam label .
to Iris and the happy days she &apos;s leaving behind .
and the blue-blooded check-chaser she &apos;s dashing to London to marry .
the blue-blooded check-chaser .
I have no regrets . I &apos;ve been everywhere and done everything .
I &apos;ve eaten caviar at Cannes ... sausage rolls at the docks .
I &apos;ve played baccarat at Biarritz ... and darts with the rural dean .
what is there left for me but ... marriage ?
Oh !
it &apos;s this hanging about that gets me .
if only we knew what was happening in England .
mustn &apos;t lose grip , Charters .
come in .
- Did you follow that ?
- I did .
tell her this has gone far enough .
no , uh - No change , uh - change here .
um , outside .
- She doesn &apos;t understand .
- No . come on .
Oh !
nothing newer than last month .
I don &apos;t suppose there is such a thing as a wireless set hereabouts .
being in the dark like this - our communications cut off in a time of crisis .
Hello , hello , hello ! London ?
you want Mr. Seltzer ? Yes . hold on .
I &apos;m going right to - to find where he is .
London .
go on . risk it .
Hello . Hello . you .
huh ? no , no , no . I &apos;m not Mr. Seltzer .
name &apos;s Charters . I don &apos;t suppose you know me . what ?
well , you needn &apos;t worry . they &apos;ve just gone to fetch him .
tell me . what &apos;s happening to England ?
&quot; blowing a gale &quot; ? no , you don &apos;t follow me , sir .
I &apos;m inquiring about the test match in Manchester .
cricket , sir ! cricket ! what ?
you can &apos;t be in England and not know the test score .
- Fella says he doesn &apos;t know .
- Oh , silly ass .
Hello . can &apos;t you find out ? nonsense .
Oh , all right . if you won &apos;t , you won &apos;t !
- Wasting my time . the fella &apos;s an ignoramus .
- Mr. Seltzer ... at last your call come through to London .
Hello . Hello , hello . London .
huh ? London .
thank you , waiter .
- What do you say to a grilled steak ?
- That &apos;s a very good idea .
- Well done for me , please .
- On the red side for me .
these people have a passion for repeating themselves .
- I - I beg your pardon .
- Mm-hmm ?
he &apos;s trying to explain to you that , owing to the large number of visitors , there &apos;s no food left .
no food ?
what sort of place is this ?
expect us to share a blasted dog box with a servant girl on an empty stomach ?
is that hospitality ? is that organization ?
Oh . thank you .
- I &apos;m hungry , you know .
- What a country . I don &apos;t wonder they have revolutions .
you &apos;re very welcome to what &apos;s left of the cheese .
uh , of course , it &apos;s not like beefsteak , but it &apos;s awfully rich in vitamins .
- Really . thank you very much .
- I &apos;m afraid they &apos;re not accustomed to catering for so many people .
Bandrika is one of Europe &apos;s few undiscovered corners .
Yes . that &apos;s probably &apos; cause there &apos;s nothing worth discovering , I should think .
you may not know it as well as I do .
I &apos;m feeling quite miserable at the thought of leaving it .
- After you with the cheese , please .
- Certainly , old man . why not ?
- So you &apos;re going home ?
- Tomorrow .
my little charges are quite grown up .
I &apos;m a governess and a music teacher , you know .
in the six years I &apos;ve lived here , I &apos;ve grown to love the country , especially the mountains .
I sometimes think they &apos;re like very friendly neighbors .
you know , the - the big father and mother mountain with their white snow hats .
and their nephews and nieces . not quite so big . with smaller hats .
right down to the tiniest hillock without any hat at all .
well , of course , that &apos;s just my fancy .
- Oh , really .
- I like to watch them from my bedroom every night when there &apos;s a moon .
I &apos;m so glad there &apos;s a moon tonight .
do you hear that music ?
everyone sings here . the people are just like happy children ... with laughter on their lips and music in their hearts .
- It &apos;s not reflected in their politics , you know .
- I never think you should judge any country by its politics .
after all , we English are quite honest by nature , aren &apos;t we ?
you &apos;ll excuse me if I run away . good night . good night .
good night .
queer sort of bird .
trifle whimsical , I thought .
well , after six years in this hole , we &apos;d be whimsical .
Oh , I don &apos;t think so , old man .
- She was very decent about that cheese .
- Mmm .
I see she &apos;s finished the pickles .
good night , Iris .
- Listen . someone &apos;s serenading .
- Oh , let him . nothing will keep me awake tonight .
good night , my children .
what &apos;s happening ? an earthquake ?
that would hardly account for the music , would it ?
what a horrible noise .
- What can they be doing ?
- I don &apos;t know , but I &apos;ll soon find out .
Hello .
musical country , this .
- I feel quite sorry for that poor singer outside ... having to compete with this .
Boris , Miss Henderson speaking .
look . someone upstairs is playing musical chairs with an elephant .
move one of them out , will you ? I want to get some sleep .
all right . that ought to settle it .
thank you so much .
some people have so little consideration for others ... which makes life so much more difficult than it need be .
don &apos;t you think ? well , good night . thank you so much .
I expect you &apos;ll be going on the train in the morning .
- Yes .
- I hope we shall meet again under - under quieter circumstances .
- Good night .
- Good night .
Miss , please , I &apos;Il fix everything .
you &apos;d better .
hold it . steady . don &apos;t move .
uh -
- If you please , sir -
- Get out !
please , sir . will you kindly stop ?
they are all complaining in the hotel . you make too much noise .
- Too much what ?
- Too much noise .
you dare to call it a noise .
the ancient music with which your peasant ancestors ... celebrated every wedding for countless generations .
the dance they danced when your father married your mother ... always supposing you were born in wedlock , which I doubt .
look at them .
- I take it you &apos;re the manager .
- Sure I am the manager of this hotel .
fortunately I &apos;m accustomed to squalor . tell me . who &apos;s complaining ?
- This young English lady underneath .
- Well , you tell the young English lady underneath ... that I am putting on record for the benefit of mankind ... one of the lost folk dances of Central Europe ... and furthermore , she does not own this hotel .
but , sir , don &apos;t you understand ?
now , one , two -
you know what he said ?
&quot; who she think she is ? the queen of Sheba ?
she think she owns this hotel ? &quot;
- Well , can &apos;t you get rid of him ?
- Impossible .
- Are you sure ?
- Uh , I begin to wonder .
it &apos;s come back to me . I &apos;ve got an idea .
you see , the German lady . she will call him up on the telephone .
she say , &quot; Young man . it &apos;s my room .
I did pay for it . get out quickly . &quot;
- How &apos;s that , huh ?
- Good enough .
we &apos;ll eject him with a little -
he &apos;ll never forget as long as he live .
nothing but baseball .
you know . we used to call it rounders .
children play it with a rubber ball and with a stick .
not a word about cricket .
Americans got no sense of proportion .
come in .
I can &apos;t stand this ridiculous lack of privacy . lock the door .
Oh !
who are you ? what do you want ?
- Recognize the signature tune ?
- Will you please get out .
Oh , this is a much better room .
definitely an acceptable room .
what exactly do you think you &apos;re doing ?
keep away .
would you hold those for a minute ?
put those back at once .
- Now , which side do you like to sleep ?
- Do you want me to throw you out ?
Oh , in that case , I &apos;Il sleep in the middle .
smart of you to bribe the manager .
an eye for an eye ... and a tooth for a toothbrush .
I suppose you realize you &apos;re behaving like a complete cad .
on the contrary , you &apos;re perfectly at liberty to sleep in the corridor if you want to .
Hello .
Oh , I shouldn &apos;t if I were you .
I &apos;d only tell everyone you invited me here .
and when I say everyone , I mean everyone .
and I have a powerful voice .
- Come out of there at once !
- Not until you bribe the manager to restore me to my attic .
come out of that bathroom !
Hello . Boris ?
look . I was thinking . I
- I might change my mind about that room upstairs if -
Oh , by the way , you might have my things taken upstairs .
you &apos;re the most contemptible person I &apos;ve ever met in all my life !
well , confidentially , I think you &apos;re a bit of a stinker too .
well , if we get to Bâle on time , we should see the last day of the match .
I hope the weather &apos;s like this in Manchester .
perfect wicket for our fellas .
we &apos;re somewhere along here .
if you don &apos;t hurry , Margaret , we shan &apos;t get that compartment to ourselves .
does it matter ?
well , there &apos;s still time to change your mind , Iris .
Yes . why not send Charles a greetings telegram and tell him he &apos;s all washed up ?
no . it &apos;s too late . this time next week ...
I shall be a slightly sunburnt offering on an altar in Hanover Square .
I shan &apos;t mind , really .
Oh ! good morning .
I can &apos;t find my bag .
it &apos;s a brown holdall , you know . have you seen -
no . of course not . uh , thank you .
well , I gave it to the porter . I can &apos;t imagine what happened .
Oh , she dropped her glasses .
- Say , you dropped your glasses . - Oh .
thank you , my dear .
- Oh ! - Oh , dear , oh , dear , oh , dear !
- Darling , are you hurt ?
- Oh !
I don &apos;t know . what was it ?
never mind about that .
this cockeyed station of yours has practically brained my friend .
- Yes indeed !
- Well , what are you going to do about it ?
- He says he cannot hold the train .
- I like that !
hurry up ! it &apos;s going .
- Yes , my dear .
- I &apos;Il be all right .
- Are you sure ? - Be careful now .
careful .
don &apos;t worry . I &apos;ll look after her . such carelessness .
you sure you &apos;re all right ?
- Send us a copy of the Times .
- Write and tell us all about it .
good luck . look after yourself .
there , there . you &apos;ll be all right in a minute .
just take everything quietly .
put some of this eau de cologne on your head .
- Do you feel any better ?
- Yes , thank you . I &apos;m all right now .
what you need is a good , strong cup of tea .
- I &apos;ll ring for the attendant . - No , no .
please don &apos;t bother .
I &apos;ll go to the dining car myself . I need some air .
Oh , well , in that case , I &apos;ll come with you . if you don &apos;t mind , that is .
no , of course not .
Ah -
Oh ! I - I beg your pardon .
you can always tell a honeymoon couple , you know . they &apos;re so shy .
- Why did you do that ?
- Well , we don &apos;t want people staring at us .
anyone would think the whole legal profession were dogging you .
- Oh , one would be enough .
- You even thought that beggar in Damascus was a barrister in disguise .
I merely said his face was distinguished enough for a judge .
you hurried off in the opposite direction , I noticed .
that &apos;s not true . I was looking for a street called &quot; Straight . &quot;
- You weren &apos;t so careful the first few days .
- I know . I know .
and anyway , as for you meeting someone you know , what about me ?
Robert thinks I &apos;m cruising with Mother .
if one &apos;s feeling a little bit shaky , I always think it &apos;s best to sit in the middle of the coach .
preferably facing the engine . uh , a pot of tea for two , please .
- Very good .
- Oh , and - and just a minute .
will you please tell them to make it from this ?
I don &apos;t drink any other .
uh , and - and make absolutely sure that the water is really boiling .
you understand ?
it &apos;s a little fad of mine .
my dear father and mother ... who I &apos;m thankful to say are still alive ... and enjoying good health , invariably drink it .
and so I follow their footsteps .
do you know a million Mexicans drink it ?
at least that &apos;s what it says on the packet .
it &apos;s very kind of you to help me like this .
I don &apos;t think we &apos;ve introduced ourselves .
my name &apos;s Iris Henderson . I &apos;m going home to be married .
really ? Oh , how very exciting .
- I do hope you &apos;Il be happy .
- Thank you .
you &apos;Il have children , won &apos;t you ? they make such a difference .
I always think it &apos;s being with kiddies so much that &apos;s made me - if I may say so - young for my age .
I &apos;m a governess , you know . my name &apos;s Froy .
did you say Freud ?
no . O-Y . not E-U-D .
- Froy .
- I &apos;m sorry . I can &apos;t hear .
Froy . it rhymes with &quot; joy . &quot;
thank you . uh , please reserve two places for lunch , will you ?
- That is if you &apos;d care to have it with me .
- Of course .
there &apos;s nothing moot about it . it simply wasn &apos;t out . that &apos;s all .
but for the umpire &apos;s blunder , he &apos;d probably still be batting .
- What do you mean ? I don &apos;t understand .
- I &apos;ll show you . look here .
I saw the whole thing .
there . now then . there &apos;s Hammond .
there &apos;s the bowler . there &apos;s the umpire .
- Sugar ?
- Two , please .
dear me . there is no sugar .
now watch this very , very carefully , Caldicott .
- Grimmett was bowling .
- May I trouble you for the sugar , please ?
- What ?
- The sugar , please .
thank you so much .
if I were you , I &apos;d try and get a little sleep .
it &apos;ll make you feel quite well again .
there &apos;s a most intriguing acrostic in The Needlewoman .
I &apos;m going to try and unravel it before you wake up .
reservations for lunch , please .
- Madame has booked for lunch ?
- Oh , I think my friend did . she &apos;s got the tickets .
- Have you seen my friend ?
- No .
um , my friend . where is she ?
la signora inglese . the English lady . where is she ?
there has been no English lady here .
- What ?
- There has been no English lady here .
there has . she sat there in the corner .
you saw her . you spoke to her . she sat next to you .
but it &apos;s ridiculous .
she took me to the dining car and came back here with me .
you went and came back alone .
maybe you don &apos;t understand .
I mean the lady who looked after me when I was knocked out .
Ah . perhaps it make you forget , eh ?
well , I may be very dense , but if this is some sort of a joke , I &apos;m afraid I don &apos;t see the point .
- Oh , steward , you served me tea just now .
- Yes , madame .
- Have you seen the lady I was with ? the English lady .
- But madame was alone .
- Pardon , madame . he make mistake .
- Well , of course .
he must remember the little English lady .
she ordered the tea and paid for it .
no . it is you who paid .
he say to look at the bill . I will look , madame .
but she gave you a special packet of tea . you can &apos;t have forgotten that .
the tea was ours , madame . I received no packet .
- But you did . I know what happened .
- Pardon , madame . the bill .
- Uh , tea for one .
- But that &apos;s not right .
perhaps madame would care to examine the bills herself .
no , I wouldn &apos;t . the whole thing &apos;s too absurd .
please , have you seen a lady pass through -
- Oh .
- Well , well . if it isn &apos;t old stinker .
if I thought you were going to be on this train , I &apos;d have stayed another week in the hotel .
- Uh , lady ? no . why .
- It doesn &apos;t matter .
you probably wouldn &apos;t recognize one anyway .
Hello . feeling queer ?
it &apos;s that pipe of yours , George .
why don &apos;t you throw your old socks away ?
never mind . thanks for the help all the same .
come on . sit down . take it easy .
- What &apos;s the trouble ?
- If you must know , something fell on my head .
- When ? Infancy ?
- At the station .
- Oh . bad luck . can I help ?
- No . only by going away .
no , no , no .
my father always taught me never desert a lady in trouble .
he even carried that as far as marrying Mother .
I say , did you see a little lady last night in the hotel ?
I only saw one little lady . she was hardly in tweeds .
but she was in my compartment , and now I can &apos;t find her .
she must be still on the train . we haven &apos;t stopped since we started .
- Of course she &apos;s still on the train . I know that .
- all right . nobody said she isn &apos;t .
- Yes , but that &apos;s just what they are saying .
- Who ?
the rest of the people in the compartment and the stewards .
they insist they never saw her .
- All of them ?
- all of them .
- You were saying you got a knock on the head ?
- What do you mean ?
- Never mind . do you talk the lingo ?
- No .
well , they probably thought you were trying to borrow some money .
come on . let &apos;s knock the idea out of their stupid heads .
a most unfortunate remark . I beg your pardon .
that &apos;s one of them . the little dark man .
I say . excuse me . I think there &apos;s been a little misunderstanding .
- This young lady seems to have lost her friend .
- Yes . I have heard .
- This gentleman has been explaining to me .
- Ah .
most interesting .
and I think under the circumstances , we shall all introduce ourselves .
- I am Italian citizen . my wife and child .
- How do you do ?
- Oh , bonny little chap . how old is he ?
- 1934 class .
- Ah . - Sì .
and the lady in the corner is the Baroness Atona .
Oh , yes . I met her husband .
he presented prizes at the folk dance festival . minister of propaganda .
and I am Dr. Egon Hartz of Prague . you may have heard of me .
- Not the brain specialist ?
- Yes . the same .
you flew over to England the other day and operated on one of our cabinet ministers .
- Oh , yes .
- Tell me . did you find anything ?
- A slight cerebral contusion .
- Oh , well , that &apos;s better than nothing .
but I am picking up a similar case at the next station , but so much more complicated .
I shall operate at the national hospital tonight .
among other things , a cranial fracture with compression .
- Do you understand ?
- Oh , yes . a wallop on the bean .
- I suppose you haven &apos;t seen my friend .
- Unfortunately , no .
I &apos;ll just take a word with the baroness .
uh -
no .
- What do they say ?
- Well , they both say they &apos;ve never seen her .
but that &apos;s not true . she was sitting where you are .
- Can you describe her ?
- Well , it &apos;s a bit difficult .
you see , she was sort of middle-aged and ordinary .
- Well , what was she wearing ?
- Tweeds , oatmeal flecked with brown ... a three-quarter coat with patch pockets ... a scarf , a felt hat , brown shoes ... a tussah shirt and - and a small blue handkerchief in her breast pocket .
- I can &apos;t remember any more .
- You couldn &apos;t have been paying attention .
- Now listen . you both went along to tea .
- Yes .
- Well , surely you met somebody .
- I suppose we did , but -
wait a moment . let me think .
Oh , yes . there was an Englishman who passed the sugar .
right you are . let &apos;s go along and dig him out .
pardon me . I &apos;ll come with you . this is most interesting to me .
well , we don &apos;t like people muscling in , but we &apos;Il make you a member .
wait a moment . there was somebody else .
as we passed this compartment , Miss Froy stumbled in .
there was a tall gentleman and a lady .
now we &apos;re getting somewhere .
if we can find someone who saw her , we &apos;Il have the place searched .
- Can I be of any assistance ?
- That &apos;s the gentleman .
do you happen to remember seeing this young lady pass the compartment with a little Englishwoman ?
I &apos;m , uh - I &apos;m afraid not .
but you must have . she almost fell into your compartment .
surely you haven &apos;t forgotten . it &apos;s very important .
everybody &apos;s saying she wasn &apos;t on the train , but I know she is ... and I &apos;m going to find her even if I have to stop the train to do it .
Caldicott . this is Charters . can I come in ?
you know that girl we saw at the hotel ?
she &apos;s back there kicking up a devil of a fuss .
- Says she &apos;s lost her friend .
- Well , she hasn &apos;t been in here , old man .
- But the point is she threatens to stop the train .
- Oh , Lord .
if we miss our connection in Bâle , we &apos;ll never make Manchester in time .
- This is serious .
- Let &apos;s hide in here .
I &apos;m sorry . I haven &apos;t the faintest recollection .
you must be making a mistake .
well , he obviously doesn &apos;t remember .
let &apos;s go and look for the other fellow .
- Who were you talking to outside ?
- Hmm ?
Oh , nobody . just , uh , some people in the corridor arguing .
there he is . that &apos;s the man .
I say . I &apos;m so sorry . I wonder if I can bother you .
- I wonder if you can help us .
- How ?
I was having tea about an hour ago with an English lady .
you saw her , didn &apos;t you ?
- I don &apos;t know . I mean , definitely . I was talking to my friend .
wasn &apos;t I ? - Indubitably .
but you were sitting at the next table . she turned and borrowed the sugar .
you must remember .
- I recall passing the sugar .
- Then you saw her .
I repeat . we were deep in conversation . we were discussing cricket .
I don &apos;t see how a thing like cricket can make you forget seeing people .
Oh , don &apos;t you ?
if that &apos;s your attitude , obviously there &apos;s nothing more to be said .
come , Caldicott .
- &quot; A thing like cricket . &quot;
- Hmm .
wrong tactics . we should have told him we were looking for a lost cricket ball .
but he spoke to her . there must be some explanation .
there is . please forgive me .
I &apos;m quite possibly wrong ... but I have known cases where a sudden shock or blow ... has induced the most vivid impressions .
I understand . you don &apos;t believe me .
Oh , it &apos;s not a question of belief .
even a simple concussion may have curious effects upon an imaginative person .
Yes , but I can remember every little detail .
her name - Miss Froy . everything .
so interesting .
you know , if one had time , one could trace the cause of the hallucination .
- Hallucination .
- Oh , precisely .
there is no Miss Froy . there never was a Miss Froy .
merely a vivid subjective image .
- But I met her last night at the hotel .
- You thought you did .
- Yes , but what about the name ?
- Oh , some past association .
an advertisement or a character in a novel , subconsciously remembered .
there is no reason to be frightened ... if you are quiet and relaxed .
thank you very much .
Dravka .
if you will excuse me , this is where my patient comes aboard . excuse me .
most interesting .
we &apos;re stopping .
- This is the first stop , isn &apos;t it ?
- Mm-hmm .
then Miss Froy must still be on the train .
look . you look out of this window and see if she gets off this side .
I &apos;ll take the other .
- Most interesting .
- Oh .
what was she dressed in ? Scotch tweeds , wasn &apos;t it ?
oatmeal tweeds .
Oh , I knew it had something to do with porridge .
how long does it take to get a divorce ?
- Eric . - Hmm ?
Oh , I beg your pardon . I wasn &apos;t listening .
- I said , &quot; How long does it take to get a divorce ? &quot;
- Oh , that depends . why ?
I was only wondering whether we could take our honeymoon next spring .
I mean the official one .
the difficulties are considerable .
for one thing , the courts are very crowded just now .
although I suppose we barristers ought not to complain about that .
as a matter of fact , with the - with conditions as they are now , my chances of becoming a judge are very rosy .
that is , if , uh , nothing untoward occurs .
such as you being mixed up in a divorce case yourself .
uh , yes .
in that first careless rapture of yours you said you didn &apos;t care what happened .
my dear , you must think of it from my point of view .
the law , like Caesar &apos;s wife , must be above suspicion .
even when the law spends six weeks with Caesar &apos;s wife ?
- Look here .
- Now I know why you &apos;ve been running around like a scared rabbit .
why you lied so deliberately a few minutes ago .
- I lied ? - Yes .
to those people in the corridor .
I heard every word you said .
it was merely that I didn &apos;t wish to be mixed up in any inquiry .
inquiry . just because a little woman can &apos;t be found -
that girl was making a fuss .
if the woman had disappeared ... and I &apos;d admitted having seen her , we might become vital witnesses .
my name might even appear in the papers , coupled with yours .
why , a scandal like that might lead anywhere .
anywhere .
Yes . I suppose it might .
- Nobody ?
- Nobody .
well , the only thing that came out my side was two bits of orange peel and a paper bag .
I know there &apos;s a Miss Froy . she &apos;s as real as you are .
that &apos;s what you say , and you believe it , but there doesn &apos;t appear to be anybody else who &apos;s seen her .
I saw her , I think .
- You did ?
- A little woman in tweeds .
- Yes ?
- Wearing a three-quarter coat ?
- With a scarf ? - That &apos;s right .
I saw her with you when you passed the compartment .
I knew I was right . but your husband said he hadn &apos;t seen her .
Oh , he didn &apos;t notice .
but as soon as he mentioned it , I remembered at once .
you win . you know , this calls for action .
are you prepared to make a statement ?
- Of course . if it helps .
- Ah . pardon .
my patient has just arrived . the most fascinating complication .
we &apos;ve some news for you . this lady actually saw Miss Froy .
- So - - We &apos;re going to have the train searched .
- You &apos;ll have to think of a fresh theory now , Doctor .
- It is not necessary .
my theory was a perfectly good one . the facts were misleading .
I hope you will find your friend . excuse me .
- I &apos;ll be in here if you want me . - Right you are .
come along .
Eric .
I was only going to mention that I told that girl I &apos;d seen her friend .
what &apos;s that ? have you taken leave of your senses ?
- On the contrary , I &apos;ve come to them .
- What do you mean ?
if there &apos;s a scandal , there &apos;d be a divorce .
you couldn &apos;t let me down , could you ?
you &apos;d have to do the decent thing as reluctantly as only you know how .
you forget one very important thing , Margaret .
your husband would divorce you . I &apos;ve no doubt .
but whatever happens , my wife will never divorce me .
it may seem crazy to you , but I tell you .
you &apos;re going to search the train .
Ah ! signorina . down there they look for you .
- Your friend . she come back .
- Come back ?
- Sì . Sì .
- But what happened ?
Oh . you go see . she tell you .
thanks . all right , Athelstan . relax .
the crisis is over .
come on . let &apos;s join the lady .
- Here we are .
- Miss Froy .
that isn &apos;t Miss Froy .
- Isn &apos;t it ?
- No .
I say , it &apos;s a silly thing to say , but are you Miss Froy ?
no . I am Madame Kummer .
she says she helped you into the carriage after you got the biff on the head , then went to see friends .
the baroness says that as you spoke about an English lady , she didn &apos;t connect her with Madame Kummer .
but she wasn &apos;t the lady I saw . it was Miss Froy .
oatmeal tweeds , blouse , blue silk handkerchief .
Yes . Yes , I know .
everything &apos;s the same , but it isn &apos;t her .
I beg your pardon .
when did you say you first met this Miss Froy ?
- Last night at the hotel .
- Oh . and was she wearing a costume like this ?
- Yes . I think so .
- Then I must apologize .
- You did meet her after all .
- Then -
but not on this train .
in your subconscious mind ... you substituted for the face of Madame Kummer that of Miss Froy .
but I didn &apos;t .
I couldn &apos;t have , I tell you . I talked to her here .
that &apos;s very easily settled .
there &apos;s an Englishwoman who said she saw her .
if this lady wouldn &apos;t mind - Madame -
bon .
Après vous , mesdames . what a gift for languages a fellow &apos;s got .
I &apos;m so sorry .
would you tell us , please , is this the woman you saw ?
it isn &apos;t a bit like her , is it ?
Yes , she &apos;s the woman .
- But it isn &apos;t , I tell you . it isn &apos;t .
- Are you sure ?
- Perfectly .
- She isn &apos;t . she isn &apos;t .
well , come on , then . I &apos;m so sorry to have troubled you .
well , aren &apos;t you going to say anything ?
you might at least gloat , if nothing else .
what am I expected to say ? you only did it to save your own skin .
she was lying . I saw it in her face .
they &apos;re all lying , but why ? why ?
now , why don &apos;t you sit down and take it easy ?
do you believe this nonsense about substituting Miss Froy &apos;s face for Madame Kummer &apos;s ?
well , I think any change would be an improvement .
listen , Miss Froy was on this train .
I know she was , and nothing will convince me otherwise .
must you follow me round like a pet dog ?
Oh . well , let &apos;s say a watchdog . I &apos;ve got all the better instincts .
Good-bye .
the doctor was right . you &apos;re all right .
I never saw Miss Froy on the train .
- It didn &apos;t happen . I know now .
- I &apos;m glad you &apos;re gonna take it like that .
what you want to do is to forget all about it .
just make your mind a complete blank .
you know ? watch me . you can &apos;t go wrong .
well , what about a spot of something to eat , huh ?
- Anything . - That &apos;s right .
come along .
Ah .
- Oh . would you like a little air ?
- Thanks .
- Well . do you think you can eat anything ?
- I could try .
that &apos;s the spirit .
you &apos;Il feel a different girl tomorrow .
I hope so .
I don &apos;t want to meet my fiancé a nervous wreck .
- Your ... what ?
- I &apos;m being married on Thursday .
quite sure you &apos;re not imagining that ?
- Positive .
- Oh , I was afraid so .
- Ah , food .
- I couldn &apos;t face it .
- Well , you know best . you mind if I talk with my mouth full ?
- If you must .
well , now . would you like to hear about my early life ?
- I don &apos;t think so .
- Well , since you pressed me , I &apos;Il begin with my father .
you know , it &apos;s remarkable how many great men began with their father -
- Oh , something to drink ?
- No , I -
Oh , yes , I will . a cup of tea , please .
you know , my father was a very colorful character .
amongst other things , he was strongly addicted to
- You &apos;Il never guess .
- Harriman &apos;s Herbal Tea .
- No , wrong . double scotch .
- A million Mexicans drink it .
- Maybe they do , but Father didn &apos;t .
- Miss Froy gave the waiter a packet of it .
- Packet of what ?
Harriman &apos;s Herbal Tea .
she said it was the only sort she liked .
I thought we &apos;d agree that you were going to make your mind a complete blank .
but it &apos;s so real . I &apos;m sure it happened .
- Did we , or did we not ?
- We did .
sorry . go on telling me about your father .
well , my father was a very remarkable man .
- Did he play the clarionet ?
- Incessantly .
in fact , he never put it down , unless , uh - unless it became absolutely necessary .
well , naturally I couldn &apos;t help inheriting his love of music .
- Why not ?
- It was all he left me .
you know , you &apos;re remarkably attractive .
has anyone ever told you ?
we were discussing you .
- Yes , of course . um , do you like me ?
- Not much .
well , after I &apos;d , uh , paid my father &apos;s debts ...
I started to travel , until they tried to cash the checks .
at the moment , you know , I &apos;m writing a book on folk dancing .
would you like to buy a copy ?
I &apos;d love to . when does it see the light of day ?
Hmm , about four years .
- That &apos;s a very long time .
- Very long book .
do you know why you fascinate me ?
I &apos;Il tell you .
you &apos;ve got two great qualities I used to admire in Father .
you haven &apos;t any manners at all , and ... you &apos;re always seeing things .
- Now what &apos;s the matter ?
- Look .
- It &apos;s gone !
- What &apos;s gone ?
Miss Froy &apos;s name on the window .
you saw it . you must have seen it ! she &apos;s on the train !
now steady , steady .
- Excuse me . thank you . it &apos;s okay .
- No , no ! we &apos;ve got to find her . something &apos;s happening to her !
- Now -
- Stop the train !
listen , everybody .
there &apos;s a woman on this train - Miss Froy .
some of you must have seen her . they &apos;re hiding her somewhere .
I appeal to you , all of you , to stop the train .
- Now , listen - - Please help me . please make them stop the train .
- Come on .
- Do you hear ? why don &apos;t you do something before it &apos;s too late ?
- Please . please .
- I know you think I &apos;m crazy , but I &apos;m not ! I &apos;m not !
- For heaven &apos;s sake , stop this train !
- Now , come -
leave me alone ! leave me alone !
huh . ten minutes late , thanks to that fool of a girl .
she gets up to any more of her tricks , we shall be too late for the last day of the match .
I suppose you couldn &apos;t put it to her in some way .
- What ?
- Well , people ... just don &apos;t vanish and so forth .
- She has .
- What ?
Vanished .
- Who ?
- The old dame .
- Yes .
- Well ?
- Well , how could she ?
- What ?
- Vanish .
- I don &apos;t know .
that just explains my point .
people don &apos;t just disappear into thin air .
it &apos;s done in India .
- What ?
- The rope trick .
Oh , that ? it never comes out in a photograph .
look , now . in half an hour we &apos;ll stop at Morsken , just before the border .
I will leave there , with my patient , for the national hospital .
if you will come with me , you could stay overnight in a private ward .
- You need peace and rest .
- Sorry . nothing doing .
isn &apos;t there anything we can do ?
Yes , find Miss Froy .
I tell you , my friend .
if she does not rest , I will not answer for her .
it will be best if you persuade her . she likes you .
Oh , I &apos;m just about as popular as a dose of strychnine .
if you coat it with sugar , she may swallow it .
Cosmopolitan train , this . people of all nations .
I &apos;ve just seen at least a million Mexicans in the corridor .
well , I thought I &apos;d look in to tell you to think over what Dr. Hartz said .
feel like changing your mind , I &apos;ll be hanging around .
- What &apos;s all the mystery ?
- You &apos;re right . Miss Froy is on this train .
I &apos;ve just seen the packet of tea that you were talking about .
they chucked it out with the rubbish .
- Trifle late , aren &apos;t you ? she may be dead by now .
- Well , dead or -
of course , for sheer variety , give me an English summer .
I remember once spending a bank holiday at Brighton -
we &apos;re going to search this train .
there &apos;s something definitely queer in here .
- Looks like supply service for trunk murderers .
- Don &apos;t !
look at that .
- All right , Miss Froy . it &apos;s only us .
- Hurry up . quickly .
well , perhaps it &apos;s Miss Froy bewitched . you never know .
well , anyway , I refuse to be discouraged .
faint heart never found old lady .
by the way , do you know anything about her ?
no . only that she was a governess going back home .
Mm-hmm .
- What is this thing ?
- Can &apos;t imagine .
anyway , there might be something down here .
- What on earth ?
- Our Italian friend , that -
I &apos;ve got it . wait a minute .
there you are . the Great Doppo .
- His visiting card . look .
- What &apos;s it say ?
&quot; the Great Doppo - magician , illusionist , mind reader -
&quot; will visit all the principal towns and cities .
see his , uh , fascinating act , The Vanishing L - Lady . &quot;
- Vanishing Lady ?
- Perhaps that &apos;s the explanation .
- What ?
- Maybe he &apos;s practicing on Miss Froy .
well , perhaps it &apos;s a publicity stunt .
no , I don &apos;t think so .
that wouldn &apos;t account for the baroness or Madame Kummer .
- Well , what &apos;s your theory ?
- Oh , I don &apos;t know . my theory ? I &apos;ll tell you .
Oh , dear .
I can &apos;t get one -
that one - Where are you ?
I &apos;m in here , with a strong smell of camphor ball .
- I can &apos;t see you .
- I &apos;m about somewhere .
here I am . where are you ?
- I don &apos;t know .
- Ah , this is what comes of not saying &quot; Abracadabra . &quot;
- Ooh ! Oh !
- Are you hurt ?
- Ouch .
- Come on . out with it , Oscar .
- Not much .
- Come sit down over here .
- What is that thing ?
- Well , in magic circles we call it the disappearing cabinet .
- You get inside and vanish .
- Mmm . so I noticed .
- You were about to tell me of your theory .
- Oh , my theory . well -
my theory , my dear Watson , is that we are in very deep waters indeed .
- Ahem . - Oh .
thank you very much .
let us marshal our facts over a pipeful of Baker Street shag .
in the first place , a little old lady disappears .
everyone that saw her promptly insists that she was never there at all .
- Right ?
- Right .
we know that she was .
therefore they did see her . therefore they are deliberately lying .
- Why ?
- I don &apos;t know . I &apos;m only Watson .
well , don &apos;t bury yourself in the part . I &apos;ll tell you why .
because they daren &apos;t face an inquiry .
because Miss Froy is probably still somewhere on this train .
- I told you that hours ago .
- Oh , yes . so you did .
- For that , my dear Watson , you shall have a trichinopoly cigar .
- Oh , thank you .
now there &apos;s only one thing left to do , you know - search the train in disguise .
- As what ?
- Well -
- Old English gentleman .
- They &apos;d see through you .
perhaps you &apos;re right . Aha !
will Hay , for instance .
now ... boys , boys .
which of you has stolen Miss Froy ? own up . own up .
- Those glasses , give them to me .
- They &apos;re Miss Froy &apos;s .
- You sure ?
Yes , they &apos;re exactly the same . gold rim with -
- Where did you find these ?
- Well , down here on the floor . the glass is broken .
- Well , probably in the struggle .
quick . - Pick up the glass .
you realize this is our first piece of really tangible proof ?
that &apos;s the last .
will you please give me those spectacles ? they belong to me .
- My spectacles , please !
- Yours ? are you sure ?
Ah , naughty , naughty .
you know , that &apos;s a very large nose for a very small pair of spectacles .
that &apos;s the game , is it ? let &apos;s see about that !
those are Miss Froy &apos;s glasses , and you know it .
she &apos;s been in here , and you know that too .
don &apos;t stand hopping about like a referee . cooperate .
kick him . see if he &apos;s got a false bottom .
wait a minute . I &apos;Il get him up .
Ow ! that doesn &apos;t help !
quick ! pull his ears back !
give &apos; em a twist . Yeah . that &apos;s it .
look out . he &apos;s got a knife !
quick . get a hold of it before he cuts a slice off me .
I can &apos;t reach it .
will you -
well done . that &apos;s it .
we know how that thing works . come out of there .
is he out , do you think ?
anyway , we &apos;ve gotta hide him somewhere .
what &apos;s in here ?
hurry up quick , before he comes to .
it &apos;s empty . bring him along .
come on .
Oh , no , you don &apos;t .
- Oh . - What &apos;s the matter ?
garlic . I &apos;ll be all right in a minute .
- Here . hold on to this .
- Oh , yes .
let &apos;s tie him up . Oh , well . we &apos;re getting somewhere at last .
we definitely know that Miss Froy was on this train ... and we know our friend here had something to do with it .
that ought to keep him quiet until we find her .
Ah . hard work , but worth it .
- Uh , let &apos;s have the evidence .
- Evidence ?
- Yes , the glasses .
- You &apos;ve got them .
no , I haven &apos;t got them .
- Oh .
- He &apos;s got them .
- He isn &apos;t there !
- Well -
Snookered . it &apos;s a false bottom .
that twister . he &apos;s a contortionist .
- He &apos;s gone , all right .
- Yes , to find the others and make more trouble .
we &apos;re in a nasty jam , my dear .
- We can &apos;t fight the whole train . we need allies .
- Yes , but who can we trust ?
- That &apos;s the snag .
- There &apos;s that Dr. Hartz person .
Yes , you &apos;re right . he might help . come along .
let &apos;s tell him the symptoms .
all right . Oh , wait a minute .
this is the one .
Oh . he &apos;s not there .
listen . I &apos;ve just had a particularly idiotic idea .
- Mmm . I quite believe that .
- But suppose that patient in there is Miss Froy .
Yes , but it didn &apos;t come on the train till after Miss Froy disappeared .
Oh , yes . Yes , that &apos;s why it &apos;s an idiotic idea .
- Come on . let &apos;s find the doctor .
- No , no , no . wait a minute .
- What is it ?
- Did you notice anything wrong about that nun ?
- No .
- I don &apos;t think she &apos;s a nun at all .
they don &apos;t wear high heels .
Yes , you &apos;re right . listen . did you see Madame Kummer get on the train ?
- No .
- Well , supposing they decoyed Miss Froy into the luggage van and hid her there .
the first stop , the patient comes aboard - head injury , all wrapped up .
the patient is Madame Kummer . Madame Kummer becomes Miss Froy and Miss Froy becomes ... that .
Yes , but why should they go to all this trouble to kidnap a harmless little governess ?
perhaps it isn &apos;t a governess at all .
perhaps it &apos;s some political thing , you know ?
well , let &apos;s investigate .
parlez-vous français ?
Sprechen Sie Deutsch ?
well , you &apos;ll just have to put up with it in English .
can we take a look at your patient , please ?
thank you . keep an eye on the nun .
what are you doing here ?
why are you in here ? this is the most serious accident case .
you have no business to be here at all , neither of you .
Dr. Hartz , we want you to undo those bandages and let us take a look at your patient &apos;s face .
are you out of your senses ? there is no face there .
nothing but lumps of raw flesh .
already the case has lost so much blood , nothing but a transfusion can save him .
what do you want me to do ? murder my patient ?
you &apos;re quite sure that this is your patient ?
we believe it &apos;s Miss Froy .
Miss Froy ? you can &apos;t be serious .
whatever put such ideas into your heads ?
I understand she &apos;s deaf and dumb .
- But she may lip-read .
- Oh , well , that &apos;s possible .
well , in that case , perhaps you will join me in the dining car ?
I &apos;Il be with you in a moment .
I want to be certain my patient hasn &apos;t been disturbed .
how the devil do I know how they cottoned on ?
somebody must have tipped them off .
you never said the old girl was English .
what difference does that make ?
in a few moments , I shall order three drinks in the dining car .
mine will be Chartreuse .
now , one of the stewards is working for us . now listen carefully .
there &apos;s that girl again .
seems to have recovered . lucky it blew over .
and now , perhaps , you &apos;ll tell me what &apos;s all about .
now listen , Doctor .
have you ever actually seen your patient ?
no , I merely received a message to pick the case up and operate at Morsken .
- How do you know that it &apos;s not Miss Froy ?
- We believe there &apos;s been a substitution , Doctor .
- You really mean to say that you think that someone -
- Um , um -
Oh . uh , I want a green Chartreuse .
- Won &apos;t you join me ?
- Oh , thanks . I &apos;d like a large brandy .
- And you ?
- Oh , I don &apos;t want anything .
- Oh , come on . it &apos;Il do you good .
- No , really . I don &apos;t want it .
you &apos;re very tired . it will pick you up .
all right , then . just a small one .
uh , two brandies and a Chartreuse .
tell me , do you know anything about the nun who &apos;s looking after your patient ?
nun ? no .
only that she is from a convent close to where the accident occurred .
don &apos;t you think it &apos;s rather peculiar that she &apos;s wearing high-heeled shoes ?
Oh , is she ?
well , that is rather - rather curious , isn &apos;t it ?
it &apos;s a conspiracy . that &apos;s all it can be .
all these people on the train say they haven &apos;t seen Miss Froy , but they have .
we know that , because just now in the luggage van -
- She &apos;s off again .
- Hope she doesn &apos;t create another scene .
put the lid on our getting back in time , if she did .
and then this fellow from the carriage - Doppo &apos;s his name -
he came along and grabbed the glasses .
Yeah . we went for him and had a bit of a fight .
- Oh , a fight ?
- Mm-hmm .
- We knocked him out .
- Oh .
Shh !
- He seems to have made a speedy recovery .
- Yes . all that &apos;s just bluff .
here .
Oh , but how could he be involved in a conspiracy ?
look at him , the poor fellow . he &apos;s just a harmless traveler .
he &apos;s also a music hall artist making a tour of Bandrika .
- Well ?
- Well , the baroness &apos;s husband is minister of propaganda .
one word from her and his tour would be canceled .
- Oh , I see .
- As for the stewards , if they don &apos;t do what they &apos;re told ... they &apos;ve got a nice cozy brick wall to lean up against .
well , that &apos;s just what stumps us , but all we know is that she was here on this train ... and now she &apos;s ... gone .
- Tell me about ... the two English travelers . they-they also denied seeing her .
Yes . just British diplomacy , Doctor .
&quot; never climb a fence if you can sit on it . &quot; it &apos;s an old Foreign Office proverb .
what I cannot understand is , why should anyone want to dispose of the old lady ?
Yes .
well , if you &apos;re right , it means the whole train is against us .
well , what are we going to do ?
well , in view of what you just told me , l-l-l shall risk examining the patient .
- Come on .
- Wait a minute , however -
but one moment . uh , we mustn &apos;t act suspicious .
behave as if nothing had happened .
drink . that &apos;Il steady your nerves .
to our health ... and may our enemies , if they exist , be unconscious of our purpose .
let &apos;s go . we must hurry now .
come on . drink up .
wait in here .
there you are .
- Anything wrong ?
- Nothing ... except they noticed you were wearing high heels .
however , it makes no difference .
we shall reach Morsken in three minutes .
quite an eventful journey .
- Well ?
- Yes . the patient is Miss Froy .
she will be taken off the train at Morsken , in about three minutes .
she will be removed to the hospital there and operated on .
unfortunately , the operation will not be successful .
Oh , I should perhaps have explained .
the operation will be performed ... by me .
Hmm .
you see , I am in this , uh , conspiracy , as you term it .
you are a very alert young couple ... but it &apos;s quite useless for you to think , as you are undoubtedly doing , of a way out of your dilemma .
the drinks you had just now , I regret to say , contained a quantity of Hydrocin .
for your benefit , Hydrocin is a very little-known drug ... which has the effect , in a small quantity , of paralyzing the brain ... and rendering the victim unconscious for a considerable period .
in a slightly larger quantity , of course , it induces madness .
however , you have my word the dose was a normal one .
in a very few moments now , you will join your young friend .
need I say how sorry I am , having to take such a -
how shall I say - melodramatic course ?
but your persistent meddling made it necessary .
- You all right ? you must have fainted .
- Did I ?
listen .
there &apos;s a woman next door going to be murdered ... and we &apos;ve got to get moving before this stuff takes effect .
well , uh
- I did read once that if you keep on the go , you can stay awake .
right . come on . let &apos;s get going .
it &apos;s locked .
we can &apos;t go that way . we &apos;d be spotted .
- You can &apos;t do that !
- Don &apos;t worry . it &apos;s only next door .
you carry on keeping fit - uh , touch your toes , stand on your head .
do anything , only whatever you do , don &apos;t fall asleep .
go on . you needn &apos;t be afraid . it is Miss Froy .
it &apos;s all right . you haven &apos;t been drugged .
he told me to put something in your drink , but I didn &apos;t do it .
what the devil are you ? he said you were deaf and dumb .
Oh , never mind about that now . if you want to save her , you &apos;ve got to hurry .
Hartz will be back in a minute . what &apos;s gonna happen then ?
if we can hold them off till we get past Morsken ... the frontier &apos;s a few miles beyond the station .
here . no , come on . there &apos;s still time .
that &apos;s Morsken . you finished ?
come on , Miss Froy .
- Oh !
- Cut it out , kid . you &apos;re not drugged . I &apos;Il explain later .
- Abracadabra .
- Miss Froy !
- Oh .
- Oh , I can &apos;t believe it !
- Thank you , my dear . thank you very much .
- Careful !
- Ready ?
- Yes .
- You all right , Miss Froy ?
- Yes , thank you .
it &apos;s rather like the rush hour on the underground .
look . we &apos;re slowing down .
look out .
I &apos;m sorry you &apos;ve had such an uncomfortable journey , Miss Froy .
get back on the train .
I hope nothing goes wrong . aren &apos;t we stopping rather a long time ?
the ambulance is going . we &apos;ll be off in a jiffy .
another couple of minutes , we &apos;Il be over the border .
I know I &apos;ve been well paid , and I &apos;ve done plenty of dirty work for it ... but this was murder and ...
sh-she was an Englishwoman .
- You are Bandriekan ?
- My husband was , but I &apos;m English ... and you were going to butcher her in cold blood .
your little diversion made it necessary not only to remove the lady in question ... but two others as well .
- You can &apos;t do that .
- Also , it would be unwise of us ... to permit the existence of anyone who cannot be trusted .
- You wouldn &apos;t dare . I know too much .
- Precisely .
I think we &apos;re over the border now .
- You can come out , Miss Froy .
- Oh . Oh , bless me .
- What an unpleasant journey .
- Never mind .
- You shall have a corner seat for the rest of the way .
- Okay .
- Ah .
- There you are .
okay .
now that it &apos;s over , I think you ought to tell us what it &apos;s all about .
what was that scream ?
- Surely it was only the train whistle .
- It wasn &apos;t . it was a woman .
be careful .
they &apos;ve rumbled .
we &apos;re on a branchline and they &apos;ve slipped the rear part of the train .
- Oh , dear . Oh , dear .
- Look here .
who are you ... and why are these people going to these lengths to get hold of you ?
I haven &apos;t the faintest idea . I - I &apos;m a children &apos;s governess , you know .
I can only think they &apos;ve made some terrible mistake .
why are you holding out on us ? tell us the truth !
you got us involved in this fantastic plot , you might at least trust us .
I really don &apos;t know . I -
I wonder if there &apos;s anybody else left on the train .
well , there &apos;s only the dining car in front , but there won &apos;t be anybody there now .
what do you make it ? Teatime .
well , all the English will be there . I &apos;m going to take a look .
come on . we &apos;d better stick together .
there &apos;s the old girl turned up .
told you it was a lot of fuss about nothing . bolt must have jammed .
I &apos;ve got something to say . will you all please listen ?
an attempt has been made to abduct this lady by force .
I &apos;ve got reason to believe that the people who did it are going to try again .
- What &apos;s the fellow driveling about ?
if you don &apos;t believe me , you can look out of the window .
this train &apos;s been diverted onto a branchline .
- What are you talking about ? Abductions , diverted trains -
- We &apos;re telling you the truth !
I &apos;m not in the least interested .
Y-You &apos;ve annoyed us enough with your ridiculous story .
my dear chap , you must have got hold of the wrong end of the stick somewhere .
- Yes . things like that just don &apos;t happen .
- We &apos;re not in England now .
- I don &apos;t see what difference that makes .
- We &apos;re stopping .
do you see those cars ? they &apos;re here to take Miss Froy away .
nonsense . look . there go a couple of people .
the cars have obviously come to pick them up .
in that case , why go to the trouble of uncoupling the train and diverting it ?
- Uncoupling ?
- There &apos;s nothing left of the train beyond the sleeping car .
- There must be . our bags are in the first-class carriage .
- Not any longer .
- Would you like to come and look ?
- If this is a practical joke , I warn you , I shan &apos;t think it very funny .
good Lord !
let &apos;s have some of that brandy .
- You don &apos;t suppose there &apos;s something in this , uh , fellow &apos;s story , Caldicott , do you ?
I mean , after all , people don &apos;t go about tying up nuns .
someone &apos;s coming !
they can &apos;t possibly do anything to us . we &apos;re British subjects .
I have come to offer the most sincere apologies .
an extremely serious incident has occurred .
an attempt has been made to interfere with passengers on this train .
fortunately , it was brought to the notice of the authorities ... and so if you will be good enough to accompany me to Morsken ...
I will inform the British embassy at once .
ladies and gentlemen , the cars are at your disposal .
we &apos;re very grateful . it &apos;s lucky some of you fellows understand English .
- Well , I was at Oxford .
- Really ? so was I. What year ?
hold on . this woman seems to be trying to say something .
- I don &apos;t understand the language and it may be important .
would you - - Certainly .
that &apos;s fixed him . that &apos;s all right . he &apos;s only stunned .
- What the blazes did you do that for ?
- Well , I was at Cambridge .
what &apos;s that got to do with it ? you heard what he said , didn &apos;t you ?
I heard what she said . that was a trick to get us off the train .
I don &apos;t believe it . the man &apos;s explanation was quite satisfactory .
thing like this might cause a war .
I &apos;m going outside , tell them what &apos;s occurred .
- It &apos;s up to us to apologize and put the matter right .
- What ? look -
- You were right . do you mind , old man ?
- Certainly .
- Look as if they mean business .
- I &apos;m afraid so .
- They can &apos;t do anything . it would mean an international situation .
- It &apos;s happened before .
- They &apos;re coming .
- Don &apos;t let them in ! they &apos;ll murder us .
they daren &apos;t let us go now .
- I order you to surrender at once .
- Nothing doing . come any nearer , I &apos;ll fire .
I &apos;ve warned you .
better take cover . they &apos;Il start any minute now .
nasty jam , this . don &apos;t like the look of it .
- Got plenty of ammunition ?
- Whole pouch full .
- Good .
- Duck down , you !
- I &apos;m not gonna fight . it &apos;s madness .
- It &apos;ll be safer to protest down here .
Hello . they &apos;re trying to work round to the other side .
you &apos;re behaving like a pack of fools !
what chance have we got against a lot of armed men ?
you heard what the mother superior said . we surrender now , we &apos;re in for it .
we &apos;Il never get to the match now .
- Give it to me .
- No .
give it to me !
- What &apos;s going on here ?
- He &apos;s got a gun and he won &apos;t use it .
what &apos;s the idea ?
- Well , I told you . I won &apos;t be a party to this sort of thing .
I don &apos;t believe in fighting !
- Pacifist , eh ?
won &apos;t work , old boy . early Christians tried it and got thrown to the lions .
come on . hand it over .
I &apos;m not afraid to use it .
probably more used to it . I once won a box of cigars .
he &apos;s talking rot . he &apos;s a damn good shot .
hope the old hand hasn &apos;t lost its cunning .
you know , I &apos;m half inclined to believe ... that there &apos;s some rational explanation to all this .
rotten . only knocked his hat off .
do you mind if I talk to you for a minute ?
- What , now ? - Yes , I
- Please forgive me , but it &apos;s very important .
hang on to this for me , will you ?
- All right . I &apos;ll hold the fort .
- I think it &apos;s safer along here . you come too .
keep your head low .
I just wanted to tell you ... that I must be getting along now .
but you can &apos;t ! you &apos;ll never get away . you &apos;ll be shot down .
I must take that risk . listen carefully .
in case I &apos;m unlucky and you get through ...
I want you to take back a message to a Mr. Callendar at the Foreign Office in Whitehall .
- Then you are a spy .
- I always think that &apos;s such a grim word .
- Well , what is the message ?
- It &apos;s a tune .
- Tune ?
- It contains - in code , of course - the vital clause of a secret pact between two European countries .
- I want you to memorize it .
- Well , go ahead .
the first part of it goes like this -
Oh , perhaps I &apos;d better write it down . have you got a piece of paper ?
no , don &apos;t bother . I was brought up on music . I can memorize anything .
very well .
- Hello . the old girl &apos;s gone off her rocker .
- I don &apos;t wonder .
why don &apos;t you face it ? those swine out there will go on firing till they &apos;ve killed the lot of us .
for goodness &apos; sake . shut up , Eric .
that &apos;s right . now we &apos;ve got two chances instead of one .
- You bet .
- You sure you &apos;ll remember it ?
Oh , don &apos;t worry . I won &apos;t stop whistling it .
- I suppose this is my best way out .
- Yes , just about .
but you may be hit , and even if you do get away , they &apos;ll stop you at the frontier .
- We can &apos;t let her go like this !
- This is a hell of a risk you &apos;re taking .
in this sort of job , one must take risks .
I &apos;m very grateful to you both for all you &apos;ve done .
I do hope and pray no harm will come to you ... and that we shall all meet again ...
- I hope so too . good luck .
- Good luck .
will you help me ?
Yes . right .
- Now you take the weight on this .
Yes . - Hold on .
- Hold your shirt .
- Right you are .
Good-bye .
- Was she hit ?
- I &apos;m not sure .
well , that &apos;s the end of my 12 .
there &apos;s not much left here either .
listen . we &apos;ve only got one chance now .
we &apos;ve got to get this train going , drive it back to the main line and then try and cross the frontier .
that &apos;s a bit of a tall order , isn &apos;t it ?
those driver fellows are not likely to do as you tell them .
we &apos;ll bluff them with this .
- Who &apos;s coming ?
- You can count on me .
- Me too .
well , we can &apos;t all go . you stay here and carry on .
if we have any luck , we &apos;ll stop the train when we reach the points .
- You jump out and switch them over .
- Okay .
you idiots . you &apos;re just inviting death .
I &apos;ve had enough .
just because I have the sense to try and avoid being murdered , I &apos;m accused of being a pacifist .
all right . I &apos;d rather be called a rat than die like one .
think for a moment , will you ?
if we give ourselves up , they daren &apos;t murder us in cold blood .
- They &apos;re bound to give us a trial .
- Stop jibbering , Eric . nobody &apos;s listening to you .
very well . you go your way . I &apos;Il go mine .
- Hey , where you off to ?
- I know what I &apos;m about .
- I &apos;m doing the only sensible thing .
- Oh , let the fellow go if he wants to .
you don &apos;t understand . I &apos;m -
no , please .
why aren &apos;t we going ? why aren &apos;t we going ?
they said we were going . why aren &apos;t we ?
if only he can get us away now . he must !
there &apos;s only one left . I &apos;ll keep that for a sitter .
they &apos;re moving away from the cars . they &apos;re coming towards us .
pity we haven &apos;t a few more rounds .
it &apos;s funny .
I told my husband , when I left him , that I wouldn &apos;t see him again .
Gilbert . Gilbert !
- By gad , we &apos;re off .
- This gives us a chance .
go on . keep going .
I say . do you know how to control this thing ?
I watched the fellow start it . anyway , I know something about it .
- Once drove a miniature engine on the Dymchurch line .
- Good . I &apos;Il look out for the points .
the blighters are chasing us . look .
we can &apos;t have far to go .
it &apos;s time for my little job changing the points .
thank heavens we shall be in neutral territory .
that will not be necessary .
I &apos;m sorry , but the points , as you call them , will not be changed over .
will you please be seated .
- There they are , just ahead of us . think you can stop it ?
- Hope so .
keep quite still until my friends arrive .
if anyone moves , I &apos;m afraid I shall have to shoot .
there &apos;s just one thing you don &apos;t know , Captain .
there &apos;s only one bullet left in that gun , and if you shoot me , you &apos;ll give the others a chance .
you &apos;re in rather a difficult position , aren &apos;t you ?
sit down , please .
all right .
where the devil &apos;s Charters ?
go ahead ! she &apos;s done it .
quick !
Oh !
it &apos;s all right . it &apos;s just my leg .
or as they say in English , jolly good luck to them .
my word , I &apos;m glad all that &apos;s over , aren &apos;t you ?
heaven knows what the government will say about all this .
- Nothing at all . they &apos;ll hush it up .
- What ?
Hey , take your hand off that thing . I &apos;ve got to remember a tune .
remember ?
porter , sir ?
uh , no , thanks .
well , we &apos;re home , Gilbert .
can &apos;t you stop humming that awful tune ? you must know it backwards .
I &apos;m not taking any risks .
- Charles be here to meet you ?
- I expect so .
♪ ♪ Well , you &apos;ll be pretty busy between now and Thursday .
I could meet you for lunch or dinner , if you &apos;d like it .
I &apos;m sorry . I didn &apos;t mean that . I -
no , as a matter of fact , I &apos;ve got to deliver this theme song for Miss Froy .
when I &apos;ve done that , I &apos;m gonna dash off to Yorkshire and finish my book .
I see .
- Ready ?
- Yes .
ample time to catch the 6 : 50 to Manchester after all .
Yes .
- Any sign of Charles yet ?
- No . I can &apos;t see him .
well , this is where we say good-bye .
Oh , what &apos;s the matter ?
Charles ?
Yes , you heartless , callous , selfish , swollen-headed beast .
are you going anywhere ?
foreign Office .
- Where are we going for our honeymoon ?
- I don &apos;t know . somewhere quiet .
somewhere where there are no trains .
Mr. Callendar will see you now .
- Wait a minute . it &apos;s gone .
- What &apos;s gone ?
- The tune . I &apos;ve forgotten it .
- No . Oh , no !
wait a minute . let me concentrate .
no , no , no , no . that &apos;s &quot; The Wedding March . &quot;
this is awful !
I &apos;ve done nothing else but sing it since the day before yesterday , and - and now I &apos;ve forgotten it completely .
- Miss Froy . - Well , I &apos;ll be had .
tired ?
are you on leave ?
you &apos;re not very talkative .
we &apos;re here .
- What ? - Le Havre .
le Havre . this is some fog !
I know all about fogs .
I was in Tonkin .
it &apos;s not foggy in Tonkin .
are you mad , swerving to save a dog ?
got yellow fever ?
then take quinine .
you might be in the army but I &apos;m the boss in my truck .
your truck , your bones !
all right , I will .
are we really going to fight over a dog ?
don &apos;t think I &apos;m chickening out .
I could easily take a hold of you and head-butt you .
so much for your spanner !
I only grabbed it in case you tried to shoot .
shoot ?
shooting might look easy .
like shooting clay pipes at the fair .
you shoot and then ... a man screams
and grabs hold of his belly , making a face like ... Like a kid who &apos;s eaten too much .
his hands turn red . then he falls .
and you &apos;re left all alone , not understanding a thing .
it &apos;s as if the ground had fallen away . right .
anyway ...
thanks for the lift .
here . no hard feelings ?
of course not .
- Bye .
- Want the packet ? - What about you ?
- I &apos;ve got more .
well , in that case ...
it &apos;s a laugh a minute tonight .
coming to dance , Lucien ?
I told you to wait at the bar . we &apos;re talking .
I came here because you asked me to but I hate places like this .
I find this music so dreadful .
I like classical music . we know what kind of music you like , Zabel .
you know nothing . you &apos;re just petty crooks .
that &apos;s right , make us laugh .
act the fool . funny , isn &apos;t he ? sure , if you say so .
you even make the orphan laugh .
and he &apos;s not normally cheerful . you make us laugh .
it &apos;s a fact .
you can pretend to laugh but you should be ashamed of the life you lead .
your parents are respectable people .
but you lead the life of a gangster . it &apos;s so demoralising .
and to think you learned to play the piano !
listen , it &apos;s all very well acting the fool for five minutes , but enough &apos;s enough .
where &apos;s Maurice ? Yes , good old Maurice !
no idea .
he used to drop in once in a while .
but once I saw he was a crook like you ,
I asked him to space out his visits . that &apos;s all .
this music !
Maurice has disappeared and since I &apos;ve fallen out with him ...
- Over a woman , no doubt .
- That or something else .
anyway , people think I &apos;m involved . and deep down that flatters you , right ?
but you &apos;re worried it might cause you trouble so you &apos;d like to know .
precisely .
I &apos;m sure you know a lot . Yes , a lot !
you &apos;re wrong , my dears .
I don &apos;t know a thing .
and don &apos;t get so familiar .
I &apos;m old enough to be your father and I &apos;m an honest merchant . we &apos;re pretty rare these days .
madam , my hat and coat , please .
he makes fun of us and then off he goes !
let him go .
we &apos;ll go and see him later .
what for ?
just to see .
I told you to get lost !
can &apos;t you be polite ? I &apos;m asking you how much the rooms cost ?
you &apos;re dressed up like an admiral so you can help the customers .
just tell me what the rooms cost . I &apos;m telling you , this is not a hotel !
so you won &apos;t say what the rooms cost ?
it &apos;s not for tonight because I &apos;m skint .
get lost or this could turn nasty !
- Sorry .
- No harm done .
- What a brute ! - Who ? - The admiral .
- Leave me in peace . I &apos;m in a hurry .
but it &apos;s not every night I meet a friend . I don &apos;t love soldiers . I just feel sorry for them .
I might have been a soldier if I hadn &apos;t come a cropper the day I got called up .
do you have to be so clingy ?
- Is that your dog ?
- No . if you &apos;re looking for a quiet spot , I might be able to help you .
the trouble is , I &apos;m skint .
that doesn &apos;t matter . I &apos;ll take you to Panama &apos;s .
- What &apos;s Panama &apos;s ? - Panama &apos;s ?
it &apos;s the quietest spot on the coast . for a seaside resort , it &apos;s the best you can find .
my dream is ...
if you dream standing up , you &apos;ll fall over .
it &apos;s that place lit up over there . my dream is to sleep just once between clean , white sheets .
a top sheet and a bottom sheet .
your dog &apos;s back .
I told you , he &apos;s not mine .
get lost , will you ? I &apos;ve got no dog , nothing .
don &apos;t you like dogs ?
not one that &apos;s looking for a master .
come in .
want a drink ?
I &apos;m not thirsty . I just need some rest .
besides , I can &apos;t afford a drink . that doesn &apos;t matter . make yourself at home .
but I &apos;m warning you , don &apos;t try telling me some sob story about the fog , your troubles and your problems .
there &apos;s no fog here , only fair weather .
the hands are nailed down , so ... any personal stuff ...
well , I am , but I &apos;m discreet .
what do you think of this one ?
it &apos;s a real one .
I bought it in Panama , in 1906 . Panama !
it cuts America in half .
you cross it by boat and you &apos;re down below looking up at monkeys in the sky .
blue monkeys . it &apos;s wonderful .
- Tired ?
- A little . forgive me .
tired or not , it &apos;s none of my business .
usually , I never ask questions .
no harm done .
leave that alone , you idiot !
the crew will come unglued . you &apos;ve already swallowed the cabin boy .
Panama , 1906 .
32 years in the bottle and you want to gulp it down !
when I &apos;m thirsty ...
- Michel .
you &apos;ve got a crowd in tonight .
Yeah , high society !
people are what they are .
pretty awful , pretty criminal .
but there are pretty things too .
you should paint them . paint them ?
I &apos;ve tried painting flowers , young women , children ...
it was like painting crime with all that entails .
I &apos;d see crime in a rose .
it &apos;s called painting with a knife !
what could be simpler than a tree ? and yet when I paint one , I make everyone ill at ease .
there &apos;s always something or someone hidden behind the tree .
I paint things hidden behind other things .
to me , a swimmer is already a drowned man .
whenever I try to paint gaiety , music , a dance or an outdoor wedding , on my canvas I find only hatred , jealousy , murder and cemeteries .
still lives !
be quiet , you idiot ! no , I &apos;m the idiot .
only an idiot can live this way with such anguish .
I think you &apos;re complicated . Yes .
but ...
things will work out .
are you still considering suicide ?
some people go fishing some go hunting , some go to war .
others commit crimes of passion .
and some commit suicide . you have to kill someone .
that &apos;s life for you !
take your drinking , for instance , you drink to kill the pain .
me ?
I drink to get drunk .
it amounts to the same thing .
as for you , I &apos;m sure that if I did your portrait ... Leave me alone !
your hands in your pockets , at night in the fog ...
I &apos;ve had enough of this !
you and your fancy talk !
it &apos;s getting on my nerves .
- Have you been drinking too ?
- Shut up . what do you know ? I get upset and you insist that I &apos;ve been drinking .
I haven &apos;t . I just haven &apos;t eaten for two days .
there &apos;s a sign on my belly that says &quot; cold storage &quot; .
didn &apos;t they feed you in the army ? what &apos;s it to you ?
you should have said you were hungry . it &apos;s not hard .
I know .
when you &apos;re hungry you ask for food .
only I shut up out of pride . I &apos;m proud . funny , that .
you said you were hungry .
there &apos;s bread , sausage and some Chester cheese .
aren &apos;t you going to tell me to enjoy my food ?
have you forgotten your manners ?
you again !
perhaps you &apos;re hungry too .
- Is he yours ?
he &apos;s got a nice face .
so have you .
you &apos;re pretty and I like you .
I mean it . you &apos;re skinny but I like you .
it &apos;s like in the movies , I see you and I like you .
it &apos;s love at first sight . I &apos;m love-struck .
you know that little chap with wings on his back and arrows ? hearts on trees .
you girls !
do you really think that ?
what you say about love .
you girls are all the same .
you tout your wares , but really you &apos;re after romance .
what did you say ?
we tout our wares ?
Yes .
have you never heard the expression before ?
you tout your wares , you hustle .
why do you talk to me like that ? come off it !
don &apos;t tell me you came here to bring your granny a cake , like Little Red Riding Hood .
pity , because ...
I &apos;m the big bad wolf .
do you think khaki suits me ?
tell me ... Why do you keep laughing like that ?
it &apos;s not a real laugh .
it &apos;s sad . have you ever seen a woman fall in love with a soldier ?
women love a soldier when he &apos;s on parade .
I don &apos;t even know why I &apos;m telling you this .
men and women can &apos;t get along .
they don &apos;t speak the same language . they don &apos;t use the same vocabulary .
maybe so , but they can still love one another .
- Not really . - Well , then ?
I don &apos;t know .
- What was that ?
- Just some bad boys .
your lighting is like the catacombs .
- Well ? - Well ! most unfortunate .
how could you lose him ?
he &apos;ll be hiding in that shack .
I &apos;m sure he &apos;s here .
open up .
we &apos;re dying of thirst . we &apos;re closed .
if you don &apos;t open up , we &apos;ll come in anyway .
- First warning shot . fired in the air , like in Panama .
the next one &apos;s for you . they &apos;re going to shoot .
are you afraid of the gunfire ?
- I wish that was all .
- What else is there ? I can &apos;t tell you .
you &apos;re sweet .
what &apos;s your name ?
the bastards !
a real naval battle !
indeed .
Hey !
blood ?
what are you doing there ?
are you wounded ?
I must have cut my hand when I fell .
life is a curious thing , at least what you see of it between midnight and 3am .
that man mustn &apos;t see me here .
I don &apos;t want too many people to see me either .
they were after me like a pack of wolves .
I got away but it was a close call .
- give me some rum , boss . - There &apos;s no rum here .
but you can wash your hands .
Ah , yes , my hands .
blood stains clothes but it washes off hands easily .
have you ever noticed how doctors , surgeons in particular , have white , well-kept hands ?
yet they paddle in blood all day long .
I &apos;m not a doctor .
I sell cut-price trinkets . nobody asked you what you did .
there &apos;s some rainwater outside in the bucket .
are you an artist ?
I wish I was . I love the arts .
classical music , especially religious music .
it brings back memories .
I love sifting through my memories .
where &apos;s your wound ? I can &apos;t see it .
and now I &apos;ve lost my parcel .
that is upsetting .
so that wasn &apos;t your blood ?
I don &apos;t know who you are . it &apos;s none of my business .
it &apos;s dawn . you can go now .
you &apos;ve got a face I don &apos;t like .
some faces are likeable , some aren &apos;t .
it &apos;s unimportant .
a face doesn &apos;t amount to much . it carries so little weight .
mine pleases nobody , but believe it or not , when I look in a mirror , I like it .
each time the sun rises , we think something new will happen , something fresh .
then the sun goes to bed and so do we .
it &apos;s sad .
did you mean what you said earlier ?
what ?
about love .
I wouldn &apos;t have said it otherwise .
you might have said it to soften up a customer .
nothing like a cold shower to perk a fellow up .
now I &apos;m fresh as a daisy and ready for work .
you work ? Yes , down at the docks .
this holds two litres .
each morning I swipe two litres to sell at night .
it &apos;s illegal , of course , but I &apos;m the only one who recorks the barrel .
it &apos;s a simple question of professional honesty .
Bye , then .
excuse me , lovely lady , but work is work .
where are you going ?
- We &apos;re going the same way , then .
do you like life ?
- You like life , don &apos;t you ?
Yes , on certain days .
does life like you ?
so far it &apos;s been pretty mean , but ... that may change since I like it .
thanks for your hospitality . you &apos;ve been great .
thank you for keeping me company .
if I can help in any way ...
perhaps you could find me some civvies .
so you &apos;re on permanent leave ?
- I thought you didn &apos;t ask questions .
- Don &apos;t you trust me ? - Yes , but ...
- This is my only suit and I like it .
come back tonight and I might have something .
what &apos;s your shoe size ?
- Seven and a half . why ? - No reason .
sometimes luck strikes . luck ?
he &apos;s a seven and a half , like me .
he needs clothes , I have some .
he wants a new life , but ... he needs a pass .
Yes , he needs a new identity . that &apos;s obvious .
I have one going spare . - Oh ?
I &apos;m going swimming .
the sea &apos;s rough and it &apos;s foggy .
what ? I &apos;m just stating the facts .
the sea is rough and it &apos;s foggy .
and that &apos;s fine by me .
I swim pretty badly .
even so , I &apos;m going to swim out as far as possible .
what do you want me to say ?
- Nothing .
Michel ! don &apos;t do anything stupid .
what a fog !
shoes .
bottle tops , an old comb .
the seabed &apos;s vast . that &apos;s not the seabed .
the seabed &apos;s further out and deeper .
you talk like a deep-sea diver .
- How old are you ? - 17 .
me too ...
- That &apos;s funny .
- What ? - Look at Nelly . - Where ?
curious .
- I thought we were going for coffee ?
- We &apos;re going to have some fun .
I &apos;m going to Panama &apos;s tonight .
come along .
got any money ?
- Why ? do you want some ?
- You don &apos;t have any . yesterday you were hungry .
Hi .
come here a minute .
what do you want ?
nothing . we were just passing .
I came over to say hello .
and to ask for news of Maurice . - You must know something .
leave me alone . I see you &apos;ve already forgotten Maurice and found a replacement ?
great .
you &apos;ll go out with anybody but you turn me down .
I think you &apos;re pretty .
you &apos;ve got a pretty mouth .
you don &apos;t want to be touched ?
did Maurice never touch you ?
what about the others ? what about him ?
everybody except me !
leave me alone .
instead of hanging out at the Petit Tabarin , you should stay in the shop with your guardian .
by the way , when you see Zabel , tell him from me that last night &apos;s fun was just a warning .
that business disgusts me .
do I disgust you too ?
you too .
leave her alone like she asked you to .
take my advice , go and toss some stones in the water .
you soldiers are easily pleased .
you spit in the water and you &apos;re happy as Larry .
you can still leave her alone . he &apos;s the calm type .
a master of self-control .
there are three of us and you &apos;re on your own .
can &apos;t you count ?
you must be counting on the big man because you two don &apos;t amount to much .
- Whatever .
come with me . - Leave her alone !
a simple soldier dishing out orders ?
sorry , I &apos;m a bit rough .
leaving , are you ? in a hurry now ?
stay away from me .
don &apos;t hit me . don &apos;t hit me .
I &apos;m warning you ...
watch it !
watch what ?
lost your nerve all of a sudden , have you ?
you &apos;ve turned pale .
you don &apos;t look too good . next time you see me coming , I suggest you cross the street .
come on !
are you getting in or not ? Lucien looks like he &apos;s going to cry .
why did you do that ?
you don &apos;t know if I &apos;m worth it .
I thought you were in a hurry .
I don &apos;t know . I ran away .
if I don &apos;t , it will be the same .
I should go back too .
Goodbye , Jean .
I &apos;ll come to Panama &apos;s tonight if I can .
it &apos;s me . listen .
shut up !
you make fun of all that is fine and beautiful .
you &apos;ve laughed at us enough .
it &apos;s over .
are you drunk or on drugs ?
I &apos;m sick of being humiliated .
do you hear me ?
I &apos;m a man and I &apos;ll prove it . right now !
put that away . we came here to talk .
reckless youth !
give me the papers , all of them .
tell us where Maurice is .
I bet you &apos;ve bumped him off .
what a thing to say .
what were you doing down by the water with those parcels ?
- Answer me , or else ...
- Or else what ? I &apos;ll show you who I am .
I &apos;ll prove to you that I &apos;m somebody .
I know who you are .
you &apos;re Lucien Lagardier , from a fine family but ill-bred .
too much pocket money and yet never enough .
you struck some deals and got into trouble so you came to old Zabel to ask him to bail you out .
you &apos;re an ungrateful boy .
I &apos;ve helped you out before .
last night you tried to run me over and shoot me .
I don &apos;t know where Maurice is . but the papers concerning you are in safe keeping .
were it god &apos;s will for me to die a violent death , you would all be in big trouble .
you came here to scare me and you haven &apos;t succeeded .
it &apos;s true .
they came here to scare me .
to scare me !
you little worms !
don &apos;t you realise I can &apos;t even scare myself ?
shut him up !
shut him up or I &apos;ll kill him .
I &apos;ll shoot you , I swear it .
what good would that do ?
- Let me go .
go out the back way .
- One day I &apos;ll prove I &apos;m somebody .
- What &apos;s got into him ?
a soldier taught him a lesson earlier .
it was about Nelly . - Really ?
- Lucien tried to talk to her . the soldier punched Babe and slapped Lucien .
what did Lucien do ?
- Nothing . - Nothing ?
these soldiers are admirable .
why are you telling me this ?
Lucien is your friend .
- Expecting someone for lunch ?
- Yes , my goddaughter .
think she &apos;ll come back ?
she always comes back .
here she is now. go .
you fly off like a swallow .
you desert your old guardian .
you leave him all alone , worried sick . why did you run off the other night ?
I was scared .
you &apos;re such a baby . why come back , then ? the others scare me too .
don &apos;t you like it here ?
you &apos;re still a little girl and yet you &apos;re a little lady too .
don &apos;t look at me like that !
where were you last night ? nowhere .
I went for a walk . and found a regiment .
is it sailing soon ?
- Tomorrow . - Where to ?
want something ?
stay there .
can I help you ?
I &apos;d like the little box in the window . I &apos;d like &quot; Jean and Nelly &quot; engraved on it .
that &apos;s nice . it &apos;s good to be sentimental .
this man has a gift for you .
I &apos;ll make you a gift of your gift to Nelly .
any friend of my goddaughter &apos;s is a friend of mine .
they don &apos;t like me much .
- May I help you ?
did you follow me here ?
no .
I looked in the window and came in . why did you want to buy me a souvenir ?
to get rid of some spare cash .
men , women , what difference does it make ?
sorry .
business is business . I hope you &apos;ll have coffee with us .
- No , thanks .
I have to ... - Please .
such politeness in a soldier is unheard of .
I suppose you &apos;re on leave .
you &apos;re not from round here .
I bet you &apos;re from Paris . - Yes .
- That &apos;s obvious .
- Thanks . everyone &apos;s welcome here .
are you here to see family ?
Nelly , fetch a bottle of cognac from the cellar .
she &apos;s a nice girl , isn &apos;t she ?
she runs away from time to time , but it &apos;s nothing serious . her mother was like that too .
short escapades but nothing serious .
then one day she left and never came back .
the girl stayed with her father . he was a fine man but he died .
more coffee ?
it &apos;s better than your average cup .
do you like the army ?
I get to travel . - Have you been in Le Havre long ?
- Since yesterday .
pretty town , isn &apos;t it ?
Nelly !
don &apos;t touch me .
leave me alone ! I need to talk to you .
what do you want from him ?
you have a fever .
come and lie down . I &apos;ll take you to your room .
she &apos;s so sensitive . the slightest thing upsets her .
you were at Panama &apos;s last night .
what of it ?
I didn &apos;t see you but I saw your dog .
he growled at me . Nelly was there too , wasn &apos;t she ?
I don &apos;t answer questions I don &apos;t like .
no one who spends the night there has a clear conscience .
really ? that goes for me as well as you .
do you have a good memory for numbers ?
I do .
take this number , for example .
36-14 . I only saw it once but I remember it .
it &apos;s your army serial number .
I saw it on your shirt earlier .
so what ? so this .
I &apos;m very discreet about people who do me a favour .
and people who don &apos;t ?
you did me a favour without knowing it .
by slapping Lucien Lagardier .
- Who ? - This morning down by the docks .
I &apos;m well informed .
what I don &apos;t see , I guess .
you didn &apos;t come to Le Havre by chance .
that &apos;s none of your business .
perhaps , but I &apos;m interested .
you came here because of the ships .
you &apos;re in trouble and you want to leave in search of a new life .
I can help you leave .
I have money if you want .
I can get you ID , a passport .
Lucien Lagardier is an immoral good-for-nothing .
he &apos;s threatening me and he &apos;ll stop at nothing .
so ?
I do you a favour , you do me one .
everyone &apos;s happy .
at night Lucien goes down by the water .
you &apos;re there .
you push him . he falls in . child &apos;s play !
whenever a rogue disappears , society breathes a little easier .
is that right ?
listen ... In Tonkin I once saw a limp , gooey bug .
just seeing it wiggle made me want to puke .
it was a scolopendra .
you remind me of it , with your slimy voice . you sound as if you &apos;re wading through slime .
my voice is odd but so are you .
I am the way I am .
I &apos;ve only ever stepped out of line when I &apos;ve been angry .
whenever anything good happens , scum like you come and mess it up .
you disgust me but I don &apos;t like squashing bugs .
come on .
I was watching .
Jean , be careful .
- Of your guardian ?
- Yes . I can see why you want to get out of that place .
can I see you tonight ?
- Where ?
- Anywhere . the fair on the dock .
- Fairs are big places .
- This is a small one . I &apos;ll meet you at the carousel with the white rabbits .
- What time ?
this is some pair of shoes !
so that &apos;s why he asked my size .
and I yelled at the poor man .
it &apos;s a shame he left before I could thank him .
do you know where he went ?
people come and go .
we &apos;re all just passing through .
all the same , I feel lucky .
I &apos;m a lucky devil .
funny how light a hat can feel when you &apos;re not used to it .
it &apos;s so light . the trousers are a bit tight but ...
they have side tabs .
I can adjust them . nice cloth .
he must be rich to give these away .
no doubt . he left this for you too .
money ?
850 francs . - 850 ?
- And that &apos;s not all .
a passport .
- What for ?
- He thought you might need it .
he thought ...
I didn &apos;t ask for anything . how did he guess ?
guess what ?
that I wanted to leave .
what about him ? he won &apos;t be needing it .
- Really ?
- He &apos;s not bothered .
Michel Kraus .
height : 5 &apos; 8 .
Medium-sized nose , brown hair .
funny how all men look alike on paper .
- You &apos;ll have to change the picture .
- That &apos;s easily done . and fix the stamp and the signature .
that &apos;s easy too . here ...
if no one has come for this in a year and a day , it &apos;s yours .
thanks . I &apos;m no good with words , so ...
come on .
don &apos;t forget your paint box .
your name &apos;s Michel Kraus and you &apos;re an artist .
that &apos;s right .
- goodbye .
- When do you sail ?
- Tomorrow at five .
- For Venezuela ?
pretty , isn &apos;t it ?
the ships , the sea , the sailors ...
everything &apos;s pretty to an artist .
I &apos;ve been watching you . it &apos;s easy to spot a painter &apos;s eye .
I was almost a painter myself .
I had paint in my blood .
then I did a medical degree .
you &apos;re looking at the doctor in spite of himself !
Dr. Mollet , doctor on board the Louisiana .
Michel Kraus . - Will you have a drink with me ?
- I &apos;m in a hurry . I have a lot to do too .
I sail tomorrow but I still have time for a drink .
- You sail tomorrow ?
- For Venezuela .
come along if you like . she &apos;s a good ship . you &apos;d be comfortable .
for a painter travel is a source of renewal .
- Do you take passengers ?
- Seriously ? you &apos;d really like to come ?
why not ?
there &apos;s nothing keeping me here .
as long as it &apos;s not too expensive .
I know you artists aren &apos;t wealthy .
come on . big decisions are best made over a glass of something .
Hi !
you look happy. good day ?
you bet ! two litres of the best .
- Where are you off to ?
- Hello .
- What &apos;s it to be ?
- A room . - A room ?
right away .
- What about my rum ?
- Coming right up .
- Want something ?
Yes , give me a shot .
- Of what ?
- A small shot of rum .
in a big glass !
it &apos;s just a formality . you artists are all bohemians .
my papers are in order . my passport ...
perfect . I &apos;ll arrange everything with the captain .
you can tell me if you like my watercolours .
watercolours ?
are you a landscape painter ?
I don &apos;t go in for theories .
you &apos;re not a cubist ?
a cubist ?
no . just as well , because I find cubism ...
what do you paint ?
in general ... I paint things that are hidden behind things .
very interesting .
for example , if I see a swimmer ,
I think he &apos;s going to drown . so I paint a drowning man .
your painting doesn &apos;t sound very cheerful .
as long as it &apos;s well painted . never mind the subject matter .
good health !
boss , another shot to keep these company .
are you going to take that room or not ?
Ah , yes , the room .
- How much is it ?
- 18 francs .
and what do I owe you ?
18 francs .
I &apos;ll pay up , then .
- What about the room ?
too late. good night .
and be on time . ships don &apos;t wait for you .
do you have much luggage ?
very little , just one suitcase .
- One suitcase ? - Yes .
you &apos;re leaving for Venezuela with one suitcase ?
how wonderful !
just as I imagine an artist to be .
no baggage , independence , freedom .
it &apos;s good to be free .
Yes , it is .
I &apos;m sure you plan to return . I mean ...
aren &apos;t you involved with anyone ?
no one .
don &apos;t move .
one ... two ... three .
thank you .
the journey &apos;s over so soon .
it would be wonderful if we could sail away , the two of us .
the two of us ...
that reminds me . wait here .
I need another picture .
- Another one ?
- Yes , I need another one .
to send to a girl ?
- No .
- Really ?
I said no , didn &apos;t I ?
do you take passport pictures ?
isn &apos;t that pretty ? maybe , but he looks unhappy .
it would be sad to lose him . I &apos;m used to him now , and to you .
you &apos;re a funny girl .
looking at you or listening to you ... makes me want to cry .
that shooting is getting on my nerves .
- Hungry ?
- I don &apos;t want a thing . I feel good .
really ?
you feel good with me ?
you have no idea how good I feel with you .
I can breathe . I feel alive .
this must be what happiness feels like .
if I heard you say that to anyone else , I &apos;d say it was silly .
but when you say it to me , it &apos;s strange but I like it .
you &apos;ve got pretty eyes .
kiss me .
kiss me again .
- I &apos;ll get the tickets . - There &apos;s a queue . a queue ?
what do you take me for ?
excuse me . we &apos;re with some ladies .
- You &apos;ve got a nerve ! hands off !
we rule the roost here .
don &apos;t make me laugh or my eye-liner will run .
- I hate people like that . - People like what ?
shut up !
find yourself another one .
watch out for draughts . my hat !
what &apos;s wrong , Lucien ? are you sick ?
watch the dog .
I warned you .
come on , Nelly .
I &apos;ll kill him !
Zabel too . I &apos;ll shoot them both .
you do understand ?
of course I understand .
life can be such a bitch .
it was deadly at Zabel &apos;s , stifling .
I &apos;d have gone anywhere .
at the Petit Tabarin everyone danced and laughed .
Maurice was gentle with me and he said that he loved me .
I said I loved him too .
but it wasn &apos;t true .
no one really danced or laughed . no one was in love .
it was all make-believe .
don &apos;t cry .
when you call me Nelly like that , it &apos;s as if I were still a little girl .
you haven &apos;t grown up all that much . I have .
I &apos;ve grown up too fast and seen too much .
I &apos;m damaged .
damaged ?
don &apos;t be silly . you &apos;re the sweetest girl I &apos;ve ever met .
a pretty young girl who loves life is like a man making a bid for freedom .
the world is against them .
they get hunted down . living is hard .
we &apos;re all alone .
at times we meet people we barely know and may never see again .
and they help us . we don &apos;t know why .
it &apos;s strange .
people love one another . no , they don &apos;t .
they don &apos;t have time for that .
I love you , Jean .
you talk like a child .
I really do love you .
don &apos;t leave me . what will I do without you ?
I &apos;m not going back to Zabel &apos;s .
I can &apos;t live in constant fear .
will you stay a few more days ?
who said I was leaving ?
seeing you in civvies , I suddenly thought ...
what difference does it make ?
maybe you &apos;ll take me with you ?
take you with me ?
don &apos;t you like me ?
keep me with you .
you &apos;re beautiful .
- Remember ?
- What ?
last night you woke me and spoke very softly .
you said you loved me .
I said that ?
- You must have been dreaming .
- Or you were . - Me ? - Dreaming out loud .
I don &apos;t dream .
everyone dreams .
- What time is it ?
- I don &apos;t know . eleven ?
the sunlight is lovely .
why are you smiling ?
I don &apos;t know .
I thought life was so sad and now ...
I see that maybe I was wrong so I &apos;m happy .
really ?
I have to tell you something .
it &apos;s not very nice .
- What is it ?
- Breakfast .
come in .
I brought the newspaper .
there &apos;s an amazing crime story .
the victim wasn &apos;t just anybody .
he &apos;s not very cheery .
how many sugars ?
two .
gruesome DISCOVERY
the mutilated body of a local man washed up on the quay
- How dreadful !
- What &apos;s wrong ?
I was right to be afraid .
I knew it . I sensed something was going to happen .
how dreadful !
well , well .
don &apos;t cry .
I &apos;m sure the scream I heard that night ...
it was him .
I knew I wasn &apos;t dreaming .
don &apos;t cry , Nelly .
I didn &apos;t love him and he hurt me , but that &apos;s not a reason to kill him .
do you know who did this ? I &apos;m pretty sure I do .
Yes ?
I need the tray .
the hotel only has two . we &apos;ve got twelve rooms so it &apos;s not easy .
you weren &apos;t very hungry .
can I take it ?
Yes , and make it quick .
there &apos;s quite a crowd on the quay where they found him .
and there &apos;s more .
apparently , they found a parcel of clothes belonging to a soldier .
they say he did it . maybe he did . who knows ?
no , it &apos;s not possible . you can &apos;t get dragged into this .
this or something else .
I was about to say something when that idiot came in with the paper , but ...
it &apos;s quite simple .
a ship is sailing for Venezuela at four and I plan to be on it .
you &apos;re leaving me .
you must think I &apos;m a bastard .
why ?
because I should have told you last night .
I saw how happy you were . you were laughing .
I wanted you so badly so I said nothing .
you were right not to .
but it wouldn &apos;t have changed anything .
kiss me .
I can explain . it &apos;s not complicated .
- I &apos;m a wanted man . - I don &apos;t need to know .
you can trust me . I &apos;m not a bad man .
of course you &apos;re not because I love you .
anyway , what of it ? if you were bad , perhaps I &apos;d love you just the same .
were you sure you &apos;d get away ?
everything was set . I thought my luck had changed .
they won &apos;t find me on the Louisiana .
my papers are in order .
- Unless ... - Unless what ?
unless your guardian Zabel ...
he threatened me . he guessed everything .
if he talks , I &apos;m done for .
- He won &apos;t say anything . - Why ?
I know what to say to shut him up .
do you think I &apos;m going to let you go back there ?
I &apos;ve got nothing to fear . anyway , what can you do ? nothing .
you must go .
I &apos;ve been happy with you .
if you &apos;re free , I &apos;ll still be happy , even if you are far away .
- I &apos;ll never forget you , Nelly . - Really ?
really .
if I manage to get away , I &apos;ll send for you .
I &apos;ll come .
you &apos;re going , I &apos;m going . it &apos;s crazy .
we were so happy together .
you have no idea how much I like you ... how much I wanted you last night .
and now ?
now ?
I want you like I did last night .
morning , all .
apparently , it was a soldier who did it .
- How do you know ?
- That &apos;s what they &apos;re saying .
they !
who &apos;s &quot; they &quot; ?
- Boss , I want a room . - At this time of day ?
now is as good a time as any . besides , I &apos;m sleepy .
I &apos;ll pay in advance .
it &apos;s too early . the rooms are all occupied .
I &apos;ll wait .
want something ?
I &apos;m not thirsty , I &apos;m sleepy .
Nelly , is that you ?
Yes , it &apos;s me .
I &apos;m glad you &apos;re back . I &apos;ve been so worried .
have you seen the paper ? Yes .
let that be a lesson to you . no more running away .
don &apos;t worry . they won &apos;t bother you .
they don &apos;t know who killed poor Maurice .
some say it was Lucien Lagardier .
others say it was a soldier .
maybe yours . my poor child !
I don &apos;t want anyone bothering him .
we both know who did it . and I can prove it .
you have too much imagination .
you heard a scream and found a cufflink behind a crate and now you &apos;re imagining terrible things .
be quiet .
I &apos;m telling you , I know .
I bet the police came here today . did you mention Jean ?
the police did come here today .
they were very polite .
but I did not mention Jean .
if they had searched for him , they would have found him with you .
I &apos;m sure you spent the night with him .
in a hotel .
in a bed !
you can &apos;t scare me now , whatever happens .
I &apos;ll never be scared again !
I want you to let him leave .
how you &apos;ve changed , Nelly !
your eyes have never shone so brightly .
you &apos;ve lost your baby face .
is it because you love him ?
so that &apos;s it .
why do you all have to be in love ?
does anyone love me ?
this is my home .
- And my home is your home . - Thanks .
looking at my watercolours ?
the follies of my youth . don &apos;t judge them too harshly .
give me your passport and I &apos;ll take care of everything .
see you later .
you don &apos;t scare me any longer .
you horrify me !
let me go .
you disgust me !
don &apos;t yell . no one can hear you .
I want you to listen .
I won &apos;t come near you . I &apos;ll stay here .
I want you to know why I killed him .
I thought you liked his looks .
that &apos;s enough !
Maurice was a good-for-nothing .
I couldn &apos;t bear the idea of you and him ...
that &apos;s enough !
I did it because I was jealous .
you &apos;ve never experienced jealousy , you stupid child .
it &apos;s terrible to be in love , to love like Romeo when you resemble Bluebeard .
be quiet !
I horrify you , do I ?
at times I horrify myself .
but it doesn &apos;t stop me from living .
at times I &apos;m even happy , when you &apos;re near me .
leave me alone !
I like you even when you scream .
you &apos;re the only thing I love . everyone else can die .
let go of her .
- Let go of her , you bastard !
- You won &apos;t get out of here alive .
- Come on . - Watch out !
do you think you can leave , just like that ?
you must believe in miracles .
or Santa Claus .
I &apos;ll kill you too !
you &apos;re the worst scum I &apos;ve ever met !
I &apos;ll say she helped kill him .
you &apos;re disgusting !
you don &apos;t deserve to live .
you &apos;re rotten to the core .
what a mess !
come on . let &apos;s go .
why did you come back ?
I was on board the ship and then I got off because ...
I wanted to see you .
I wanted to tell you I &apos;d been happy in my life for once , thanks to you .
the ship hasn &apos;t sailed yet . you could still make it .
the ship ?
please , Jean , you must go . come on .
kiss me .
quickly .
there is no time to lose .
quickly !
it &apos;s not possible .
you can &apos;t leave me alone .
you can &apos;t die .
I love you so much .
what do we care if we were expelled from college ?
we would &apos;ve left college anyhow . war ! isn &apos;t it exciting , Scarlett ?
you know those fool Yankees actually want a war ? - We &apos;ll show them .
- Fiddle-dee-dee ! war , war , war .
this war talk &apos;s spoiling all the fun at every party this spring .
I get so bored I could scream .
why , honey , of course there &apos;s going to be a war !
if either of you says &quot; war &quot; just once again , I &apos;ll go in the house and slam the door . - But , Scarlett , honey ...
- Don &apos;t you want us to have a war ?
well ... but remember ...
I warned you .
I &apos;ve got an idea . we &apos;ll talk about the Wilkes &apos; barbecue at Twelve Oaks .
that &apos;s a good idea .
aren &apos;t you eating barbecue with us ?
I hadn &apos;t thought about that yet .
I &apos;ll think about that tomorrow . we want all your waltzes .
first Brent , then me , then Brent , then me again , and so on .
- Promise ? - I &apos;d just love to .
if only I didn &apos;t have every one of them taken already .
why , honey , you can &apos;t do that to us .
- How about if we tell you a secret ?
- A secret ? who about ? you know Miss Melanie Hamilton from Atlanta ?
Ashley Wilkes &apos; cousin .
she &apos;s visiting the Wilkes ... That goody-goody !
who wants to know a secret about her ?
anyway , we heard , that is , they say ... Ashley Wilkes is gonna marry her .
the Wilkeses always marry their cousins .
now do we get those waltzes ?
of course .
- The other boys will be hopping mad . - Let them be mad .
we can handle them ! it can &apos;t be true . Ashley loves me .
Scarlett ! what has gotten into her ? do you suppose we made her mad ?
where are you going without your shawl , and the night air fixing to set in ?
how come you didn &apos;t ask them gentlemen to stay for supper ?
there &apos;s none in the county can touch you , and none in the state .
Pa ! so proud of yourself you are .
well , Katie Scarlett O &apos;Hara .
so you &apos;ve been spying on me , and like your sister Suellen ... you &apos;ll tell your mother on me that I was jumping again .
you know I &apos;m no tattletale like Suellen , but it does seem to me ... after you broke your knee last year jumping that same fence ...
I &apos;ll not have me own daughter telling me what I shall jump and not jump .
it &apos;s my own neck , so it is .
all right , Pa , you jump what you please .
how are they all over at Twelve Oaks ?
the Wilkeses ?
just as you &apos;d expect with the barbecue tomorrow and talking nothing but war .
Oh , bother the war .
was there anyone else there ? their cousin , Melanie Hamilton from Atlanta , and her brother , Charles .
Melanie Hamilton !
she &apos;s a pale-faced , mealy-mouthed ninny . I hate her .
Ashley Wilkes doesn &apos;t think so .
Ashley Wilkes couldn &apos;t like anyone like her .
what &apos;s your interest in Ashley and Miss Melanie ?
it &apos;s nothing . let &apos;s go into the house , Pa .
has he been trifling with you ?
has he asked you to marry him ? - No !
- No , nor will he .
I have it in strictest confidence from John Wilkes this afternoon ...
Ashley is going to marry Miss Melanie . it will be announced tomorrow night at the ball .
I don &apos;t believe it .
here ! here , where are you off to ? Scarlett !
what are you about ?
have you made a spectacle of yourself running after a man ... who &apos;s not in love with you when you might have any man in the county ?
I haven &apos;t been running after him .
it &apos;s just a surprise , that &apos;s all .
now , don &apos;t be jerking your chin at me .
if Ashley wanted to marry you , it would be with misgivings I &apos;d say &quot; yes . &quot;
I want my girl to be happy . you &apos;d not be happy with him .
I would , I would !
what difference does it make who you marry ... so long as he &apos;s a Southerner and thinks like you ?
and when I &apos;m gone , I &apos;ll leave Tara to you .
I don &apos;t want Tara . Plantations don &apos;t mean anything when ...
you mean to say , Katie Scarlett O &apos;Hara , that land doesn &apos;t mean anything to you ?
why , land is the only thing in the world worth working for ... worth fighting for , worth dying for , because it &apos;s the only thing that lasts .
- Oh , Pa , you talk like an Irishman .
- It &apos;s proud I am that I &apos;m Irish . and don &apos;t you be forgetting , missy , that you &apos;re half Irish too .
and to anyone with a drop of Irish blood in them ... why , the land they live on is like their mother .
yonder she comes !
Miss Scarlett , Miss Suellen , Miss Carreen , your ma &apos;s home !
acting like a wet nurse to them low-down , poor white trash ... instead of being here eating her supper .
cookie , stir up the fire !
Miss Ellen &apos;s got no business wearing herself out .
take the lamp out on the porch . wearing herself out .
Mr. Gerald , Miss Ellen &apos;s home .
wearing herself out waiting on poor white trash .
shut up , dog ! barking in the house like that . get up from there , boy .
don &apos;t you hear Miss Ellen &apos;s coming ? get out there and get her medicine chest .
we was getting worried about you , Miss Ellen .
- Mr. Gerald ...
- All right , Pork . I &apos;m home .
Mrs. O &apos;Hara , we finished plowing the creek bottom today .
what do you want me to start on tomorrow ?
Mr. Wilkerson , I &apos;ve just come from Emmie Slattery &apos;s bedside .
your child has been born . my child , ma &apos;am ?
I &apos;m sure I don &apos;t understand . has been born , and mercifully , has died .
good night , Mr. Wilkerson .
I &apos;ll fix your supper for you myself , and you eats it .
after prayers , Mammy .
Yes , ma &apos;am . Mr. O &apos;Hara .
you must dismiss Jonas Wilkerson .
dismiss him , Mrs. O &apos;Hara ?
he &apos;s the best overseer in the county . he must go tomorrow morning , first thing .
but ... - No ! - Yes .
the Yankee Wilkerson and the white trash Slattery girl ?
we &apos;ll discuss it later , Mr. O &apos;Hara .
Yes , Mrs. O &apos;Hara .
I want to wear Scarlett &apos;s green dress !
I don &apos;t like your tone , Suellen .
your pink gown is lovely . - Can &apos;t I stay up for the ball tomorrow ? - But you may wear my garnets with it .
why can &apos;t I stay up for the ball tomorrow night ?
Scarlett ... you look tired , my dear .
I &apos;m all right , Mother .
why can &apos;t I stay up for the ball tomorrow night ?
I &apos;m 13 now . you may go to the barbecue and stay up till supper .
prayers , girls .
&quot; and to all the saints , that I have sinned exceedingly in thought , word and deed ...
&quot; through my fault .
&quot; through my fault , through my most grievous fault . &quot; therefore , I beseech the Blessed Mary , ever Virgin ...
&quot; blessed Michael , the Archangel ...
&quot; blessed John the Baptist ... &quot; the Holy Apostles , Peter and Paul ...
&quot; and all the saints to pray to the Lord , our God , for me . &quot;
Ashley doesn &apos;t know I love him .
I &apos;ll tell him that I love him and then he can &apos;t marry her . &quot; may the Almighty , and most merciful Lord ...
&quot; grant us pardon , absolution ... &quot; and remission of our sins .
amen . &quot;
just hold on and suck in .
Mammy , here &apos;s Miss Scarlett &apos;s vittles .
you can take that back . I won &apos;t eat a bite . Oh , yes , ma &apos;am , you is !
you &apos;s gonna eat every mouthful of this .
no , I &apos;m not !
put on the dress , &apos; cause we &apos;re late already .
- What &apos;s my lamb gonna wear ? - That . no you ain &apos;t !
if you say one word to Mother , I won &apos;t eat a bite .
keep your shawl on .
I ain &apos;t aiming for you to get all freckled ... after the buttermilk I done put on you all this winter , bleaching them freckles .
now , Miss Scarlett , you come on and be good , and eat just a little , honey .
no .
I &apos;m going to have a good time today and do my eating at the barbecue .
if you don &apos;t care what folks says about this family , I does !
I has told you and told you that you can always tell a lady ... by the way she eats with folks .
like a bird .
I ain &apos;t aiming for you to go to Mr. Wilkes &apos; ... and eat like a field hand and gobble like a hog !
fiddle-dee-dee .
Ashley Wilkes told me he likes to see a girl with a healthy appetite . what gentlemen says and what they thinks is two different things .
ain &apos;t no need of having it come right back up again .
why does a girl have to be so silly to catch a husband ?
Scarlett , if you &apos;re not here by the time I count ten , we &apos;ll be going without you !
I &apos;m coming , Pa !
one ... two , three ... four , five , six ...
Oh , dear !
my stays are so tight I know I &apos;ll never get through the day without belching .
well , John Wilkes .
it &apos;s a grand day you &apos;ll be having for the barbecue .
so it seems , Gerald . but why isn &apos;t Mrs. O &apos;Hara with you ?
she &apos;s after settling accounts with the overseer .
but she &apos;ll be along for the ball tonight . welcome to Twelve Oaks , Mr. O &apos;Hara .
thank you kindly , India .
your daughter &apos;s getting prettier every day , John .
India , here are the O &apos;Hara girls .
we must greet them .
I can &apos;t stand Scarlett .
if you see the way she throws herself at Ashley . now , that &apos;s your brother &apos;s business .
you must remember your duties as hostess .
good morning , girls . you &apos;re looking lovely .
good morning , Scarlett .
why , India Wilkes , what a lovely dress ! - Perfectly lovely , darling .
- I just can &apos;t take my eyes off it .
Scarlett , honey ...
you &apos;re looking mighty fine this morning .
- Good morning , Miss Scarlett . - Good morning .
- It &apos;s a pleasure to see you . - Good morning .
Howdy , Miss Scarlett . Ashley !
Scarlett , my dear .
I &apos;ve been looking for you everywhere .
I &apos;ve got something I must tell you .
- Can &apos;t we go some place where it &apos;s quiet ?
- Yes , I &apos;d like to , but I ...
I have something to tell you , too .
something I hope you &apos;ll be glad to hear .
but come say hello to my cousin Melanie , first .
Oh , do we have to ?
she &apos;s been looking forward to seeing you again .
Melanie !
here &apos;s Scarlett .
Scarlett !
I &apos;m so glad to see you again . Melanie Hamilton !
what a surprise to run into you here .
I hope you &apos;ll stay with us a few days at least .
I hope I shall stay long enough for us to become real friends , Scarlett .
I do so want us to be .
we &apos;ll keep her here , won &apos;t we , Scarlett ?
we &apos;ll just have to make the biggest fuss over her .
if there &apos;s anybody knows how to give a girl a good time , it &apos;s Ashley . though I expect our good times will seem silly to you because you &apos;re so serious .
Oh , Scarlett , you have so much life .
I &apos;ve always admired you so .
I wish I could be more like you . you mustn &apos;t flatter me , Melanie , and say things you don &apos;t mean .
nobody could accuse Melanie of being insincere .
could they , my dear ? then she &apos;s not like you , is she , Ashley ?
Ashley never means a word he says to any girl .
Oh , why , Charles Hamilton , you handsome old thing , you !
but , oh , Miss O &apos;Hara , I ...
was it kind to bring your good-looking brother here ... just to break my poor , simple , country girl &apos;s heart ?
she never even noticed Charles before .
because he &apos;s your beau , she &apos;s after him like a hornet .
Charles Hamilton , I want to eat barbecue with you .
mind you , don &apos;t go philandering with any other girl , &apos; cause I &apos;m mighty jealous .
I won &apos;t , Miss O &apos;Hara ! I couldn &apos;t !
I do declare , Frank Kennedy , if you don &apos;t look dashing ... with that new set of whiskers !
Oh , thank you , Miss Scarlett .
Charles and Rafe asked me to eat barbecue with them ... but I told them I couldn &apos;t because I promised you .
you needn &apos;t be so amused . look at her !
she &apos;s after your beau now !
Oh , that &apos;s mighty flattering of you , Miss Scarlett .
I &apos;ll see what I can do , Miss Scarlett .
what &apos;s your sister so mad about ?
you sparking her beau ?
as if I couldn &apos;t get a better beau than that old maid in britches .
Brent and Stuart Tarleton , you handsome old things , you !
no , you &apos;re not ! I won &apos;t say that . I &apos;m mad at you !
what have we done ?
you haven &apos;t been near me all day .
I wore this dress ... &apos; cause I thought you liked it .
I was counting on eating barbecue with you two .
- Well , you are , Scarlett . - Of course you are .
Oh , I never can make up my mind which of you two is the handsomer .
I was awake all last night trying to figure it out .
Cathleen , who &apos;s that ?
who ? that man looking at us and smiling .
the nasty , dark one .
my dear , don &apos;t you know ?
that &apos;s Rhett Butler .
he &apos;s from Charleston .
he has the most terrible reputation .
he looks as if he knows what I look like without my shimmy ! Scarlett !
why , my dear , he isn &apos;t received !
he spends a lot of time up North ... because his folks in Charleston won &apos;t even speak to him .
he was expelled from West Point , he &apos;s so fast .
and then there &apos;s that business about that girl he wouldn &apos;t marry .
tell , tell !
well , he took her out buggy riding in the late afternoon without a chaperon !
and then he refused to marry her !
no , but she was ruined just the same .
Ashley !
happy ? so happy !
you seem to belong here ... as if it had all been imagined for you .
I like to feel that I belong to the things you love .
you love Twelve Oaks as I do .
Yes , Ashley . I love it as ... as more than a house .
it &apos;s a whole world that wants only to be graceful and beautiful .
it &apos;s so unaware that it may not last ... forever .
you &apos;re afraid of what may happen if the war comes , aren &apos;t you ?
but we don &apos;t have to be afraid for us .
no war can come into our world , Ashley .
whatever comes ...
I &apos;ll love you , just as I do now ... until I die .
isn &apos;t this better than sitting at a table ?
a girl hasn &apos;t got but two sides to her at a table .
I &apos;ll go get her dessert .
- Here , she said me .
- Allow me , Miss O &apos;Hara .
I think ... I think Charles Hamilton may get it .
Oh , thank you , Miss O &apos;Hara ! thank you .
go get it .
isn &apos;t he the luckiest ?
Miss O &apos;Hara ... I love you .
I don &apos;t guess I &apos;m as hungry as I thought .
why do I have to take a nap ? I &apos;m not tired .
Well-brought-up young ladies take naps at parties .
it &apos;s high time you started behaving and acting like you was Miss Ellen &apos;s daughter .
when we were at Saratoga I didn &apos;t notice any Yankee girls taking naps .
no , and you ain &apos;t gonna see no Yankee girls at the ball tonight , neither .
how was Ashley today , Scarlett ?
he didn &apos;t seem to be paying much attention to you . you mind your own business !
you &apos;ll be lucky not to lose old whisker-face Kennedy .
you &apos;ve liked Ashley for months !
Pa said that his engagement &apos;s gonna be announced tonight .
that &apos;s all you know . Miss Scarlett !
Miss Suellen ! you all behave yourselves . acting like poor white trash children !
if you &apos;s old enough to go to parties , you &apos;s old enough to act like ladies .
who cares !
it &apos;s time we made them understand we &apos;ll keep our slaves ... with or without their approval .
&apos;Twas Georgia &apos;s sovereign right to secede from the Union !
that &apos;s right !
the South must assert herself by force of arms .
after we &apos;ve fired on the Yankee rascals at Fort Sumter , we &apos;ve got to fight !
- There &apos;s no other way ! - Fight ! that &apos;s right .
let the Yankees ask for peace !
the situation is very simple .
the Yankees can &apos;t fight and we can .
there won &apos;t even be a battle . they &apos;ll just turn and run every time .
one Southerner can lick 20 Yankees . we &apos;ll finish them in one battle .
gentlemen can always fight better than rabble .
Yes , gentlemen always can fight better than rabble .
what does the captain of our troop say ?
well , gentlemen , if Georgia fights , I go with her .
but , like my father , I hope the Yankees will let us leave the Union in peace .
- But , Ashley ... - But , Ashley , they &apos;ve insulted us !
you can &apos;t mean you don &apos;t want war !
most of the miseries of the world were caused by wars .
and when the wars were over no one ever knew what they were about .
if it wasn &apos;t that I knew you ...
now , gentlemen , Mr. Butler &apos;s been up North , I hear .
don &apos;t you agree with us , Mr. Butler ? I think it &apos;s hard winning a war with words , gentlemen .
what do you mean , sir ?
there &apos;s not a cannon factory in the whole South .
what difference does that make to a gentleman ?
lt &apos;ll make a great deal of difference to a great many gentlemen , sir .
are you hinting , Mr. Butler , that the Yankees can lick us ?
I &apos;m saying very plainly that the Yankees are better equipped than we .
they &apos;ve got factories , shipyards , coal mines ... and a fleet to bottle up our harbors and starve us to death .
all we &apos;ve got is cotton and slaves and arrogance .
- I refuse to listen to any renegade talk ! I &apos;m sorry if the truth offends you .
apologies aren &apos;t enough , sir !
I hear you were turned out of West Point , Mr. Rhett Butler ... and you aren &apos;t received by any decent family in Charleston , not even your own !
I apologize again for all my shortcomings .
perhaps you won &apos;t mind if I walk about and look over your place .
I seem to be spoiling everybody &apos;s brandy and cigars and ... dreams of victory .
that &apos;s just about what you could expect from somebody like Rhett Butler .
he refused to fight . not quite that , Charles . he refused to take advantage of you .
take advantage of me ?
he &apos;s one of the best shots in the country , as he &apos;s proved several times ... against steadier hands and cooler heads .
- I &apos;ll show him !
- No , please . don &apos;t go tweaking his nose anymore .
you may be needed for more important fighting , Charles .
now , if you &apos;ll excuse me , Mr. Butler is our guest .
I think I &apos;ll just show him around .
Ashley ! Scarlett .
who are you hiding from in here ?
what are you up to ?
what is this , Scarlett ? a secret ?
Oh , Ashley , Ashley ... I love you .
Scarlett ! I love you , I do !
well , isn &apos;t it enough that you &apos;ve gathered every other man &apos;s heart today ?
you &apos;ve always had mine . you cut your teeth on it . Oh , don &apos;t tease me now .
have I your heart , my darling ? I love you , I love you .
you mustn &apos;t say such things . you &apos;ll hate me for hearing them .
Oh , I could never hate you , and I know you must care about me .
Oh , you do care , don &apos;t you ?
Yes ...
I care .
Oh , can &apos;t we go away and forget we ever said these things ?
but how can we do that ?
don &apos;t you want to marry me ?
I &apos;m going to marry Melanie . but you can &apos;t . not if you care for me .
Oh , my dear , why must you make me say things that will hurt you ?
how can I make you understand ?
you &apos;re so young and unthinking .
you don &apos;t know what marriage means . I know I love you and I want to be your wife .
you don &apos;t love Melanie .
she &apos;s like me , Scarlett .
she &apos;s part of my blood and we understand each other .
but you love me .
how could I help loving you ?
you have all the passion for life that I lack .
that kind of love isn &apos;t enough for a successful marriage ... for two people as different as we are .
well , why don &apos;t you say it , you coward ?
you &apos;re afraid to marry me .
you &apos;d rather live with that fool who can &apos;t speak except ... to say &quot; yes &quot; and &quot; no &quot; and raise a passel of mealy-mouthed brats just like her .
you mustn &apos;t say such things about Melanie .
who are you to tell me I mustn &apos;t ? you led me on , you made me believe you wanted to marry me .
now , Scarlett , be fair . I never , at any time ...
you did , it &apos;s true you did !
I &apos;ll hate you till I die !
I can &apos;t think of anything bad enough to call you .
that wouldn &apos;t have been very tactful , would it ? but don &apos;t worry , your secret is safe with me .
sir , you are no gentleman ! and you , miss , are no lady .
don &apos;t think I hold that against you .
ladies have never held any charm for me .
first you take a low , common advantage of me , then you insult me .
I meant it as a compliment and I hope to see more of you ... when you &apos;re free of the spell of the elegant Mr. Wilkes .
he doesn &apos;t strike me as half good enough for a girl of your ...
your &quot; passion for living . &quot; how dare you ! you aren &apos;t fit to wipe his boots .
and you were going to hate him for the rest of your life .
she certainly made a fool of herself running after all the men at the barbecue .
that &apos;s not fair , India . she &apos;s so attractive , the men just naturally flock to her . Oh , Melanie , you &apos;re just too good to be true .
didn &apos;t you see her going after your brother Charles ? Yes , and she knows Charles belongs to me .
Oh , you &apos;re wrong , India .
Scarlett &apos;s just high-spirited and vivacious .
men may flirt with girls like that but they don &apos;t marry them .
I think you &apos;re being very mean to her .
war !
war &apos;s declared ! war !
Miss O &apos;Hara !
but it &apos;s war and everybody &apos;s going off to enlist . they &apos;re going right away . I &apos;m going , too .
Oh , Miss O &apos;Hara , will you be sorry ?
to see us go , I mean .
I &apos;ll cry into my pillow every night .
Miss O &apos;Hara , I told you I loved you . you &apos;re the most beautiful girl in the world , and the sweetest and the dearest .
I know I couldn &apos;t hope that you could love me .
I &apos;m so clumsy and stupid and not nearly good enough for you .
but if you could think of marrying me , I &apos;d do anything in the world for you .
just anything . I promise . what did you say ?
Miss O &apos;Hara , I said , would you marry me ?
Yes , Mr. Hamilton , I will .
you will ? you &apos;ll marry me ? you &apos;ll wait for me ?
I don &apos;t think I &apos;d want to wait . you mean you &apos;ll marry me before I go ?
Scarlett ... When may I speak to your father ?
the sooner the better .
I &apos;ll go now .
I can &apos;t wait . will you excuse me , dear ?
Mr. O &apos;Hara , Mr. O &apos;Hara .
it &apos;ll be a week at least before they call on me .
only a week , and then they &apos;ll take you away from me .
Scarlett , I thought of you at our wedding yesterday ... and I hoped that yours would be as beautiful , and it was .
don &apos;t cry , darling .
the war will be over in a few weeks ... and I &apos;ll be coming back to you .
you ain &apos;t supposed to be around people . you &apos;s in mourning . for what ?
I don &apos;t feel anything .
why should I have to pretend and pretend ... What is it ?
Oh , baby ...
what is it ?
my life is over .
nothing will ever happen to me anymore .
Oh , Mother .
I know you &apos;ll think I &apos;m horrible , but I just can &apos;t bear going around in black .
it &apos;s bad enough not being able to go to any parties ... but looking this way , too .
I don &apos;t think you &apos;re at all horrible .
it &apos;s only natural to want to look young and be young when you are young .
Oh , baby ...
how would you like to go visiting somewhere ? Savannah , perhaps ?
what would I do in Savannah ?
well , Atlanta , then .
there &apos;s lots going on there . and you could stay with Melanie and her Aunt Pittypat .
Melanie . Yes .
Yes , I could , couldn &apos;t I ?
Oh , Mother , you &apos;re sweet to me , sweeter than anybody in the world .
you &apos;d like it , really ? all right then .
now stop your crying and smile .
you can take Prissy with you .
start packing Miss Scarlett &apos;s things , Mammy .
I &apos;ll go write the necessary letters .
Atlanta ! Savannah would be better for you . you &apos;d just get in trouble in Atlanta .
what trouble are you talking about ? you know what trouble I &apos;s talking about .
I &apos;s talking about Mr. Ashley Wilkes .
he &apos;ll come to Atlanta when he gets his leave ... and you &apos;re sitting there waiting for him like a spider !
- He belongs to Miss Melanie ...
- You go pack my things like Mother said .
they &apos;re all whispering , and I just know it &apos;s about her .
every time I think of it I feel faint ! Aunt Pitty , you know Scarlett came here only to help raise money for the cause .
it was splendid of her to make the sacrifice .
anyone would think , to hear you talk ... that she came here to dance instead of to sell things .
ladies and gentlemen !
I have important news ! glorious news !
and now , a happy surprise for all of us .
we have with us tonight that most daring of all blockade-runners ... whose fleet schooners , slipping past the Yankee guns ... have brought us here the very woolens and laces we wear tonight .
none other than our friend from Charleston ...
Capt. Rhett Butler !
permit me .
Yes , I think so . only for a moment , Mrs. Hamilton . it was in the library .
Yes , Capt. Butler , I remember you .
ladies , the Confederacy asks for your jewelry on behalf of our noble cause .
we aren &apos;t wearing any . we &apos;re in mourning . wait .
on behalf of Mrs. Wilkes and Mrs. Hamilton .
thank you , Capt. Butler .
just a moment , please .
but it &apos;s your wedding ring , ma &apos;am .
it may help my husband more , off my finger .
thank you .
that &apos;s a very beautiful thing to do , Mrs. Wilkes .
here .
you can have mine , too , for the cause . and you , Mrs. Hamilton .
I know just how much that means to you .
- Melanie ! - Yes , Dr. Meade .
I need your approval , as a member of the Committee ... for something we want to do that &apos;s rather shocking .
will you excuse us , please ? I &apos;ll say one thing .
the war makes the most peculiar widows . I wish you &apos;d go away .
if you had any raising you &apos;d know I &apos;d never want to see you again .
now , why be silly ?
you &apos;ve no reason for hating me . I &apos;ll carry your guilty secret to my grave .
I guess I &apos;d be very unpatriotic to hate one of the great heroes of the war .
I do declare I was surprised to see you turn out to be such a noble character .
I can &apos;t bear to take advantage of your little girl ideas , Miss O &apos;Hara .
I &apos;m neither noble nor heroic . but you are a blockade-runner ?
for profit , and profit only .
are you telling me you don &apos;t believe in the cause ? I believe in Rhett Butler .
he &apos;s the only cause I know . the rest doesn &apos;t mean much to me .
and now , ladies and gentlemen ...
I have a startling surprise for the benefit of the hospital .
gentlemen , if you wish to lead the opening reel with the lady of your choice ... you must bid for her .
Caroline Meade , how can you permit your husband to conduct this ... this slave auction ?
Dolly Merriwether , how dare you criticize me !
Melanie Wilkes told the doctor ... that if it &apos;s for the benefit of the cause , it &apos;s quite all right .
Oh dear , oh dear . where are my smelling salts ? I think I shall faint .
don &apos;t you dare faint , Pittypat Hamilton . if Melanie says it &apos;s all right , it is all right .
come , gentlemen , do I hear your bids ?
make your offers . don &apos;t be bashful , gentlemen .
$ 20 . $ 20 for Miss Maybelle Merriwether .
$ 25 for Miss Fanny Elsing .
only $ 25 to give your ... $ 150 in gold .
for what lady , sir ? for Mrs. Charles Hamilton .
for whom , sir ?
Mrs. Charles Hamilton .
Mrs. Hamilton is in mourning , Capt. Butler ... but I &apos;m sure any of our Atlanta belles would be proud to ...
Dr. Meade , I said Mrs. Charles Hamilton .
she will not consider it , sir .
Oh , yes , I will .
choose your partners for the Virginia reel .
we &apos;ve sort of shocked the Confederacy .
it &apos;s a bit like blockade-running , isn &apos;t it ? it &apos;s worse .
but I expect a very fancy profit out of it . I don &apos;t care what you expect or what they think .
what do you want ?
I &apos;ll tell you , Scarlett O &apos;Hara , if you &apos;ll take that Southern belle simper off your face .
some day I want you to say to me ... the words I heard you say to Ashley Wilkes :
that &apos;s something you &apos;ll never hear from me , Capt. Butler , as long as you live .
how sweet , how kind . he is a thoughtful gentleman .
Oh , the darling thing .
Oh , Rhett , it &apos;s lovely , lovely .
you didn &apos;t really bring it all the way from Paris just for me .
Yes , I thought it was about time I got you out of that fake mourning .
next trip , I &apos;ll bring you some green silk for a frock to match it .
Oh , Rhett .
it &apos;s my duty to our brave boys at the front to keep our girls at home looking pretty . Oh , it &apos;s so long since I &apos;ve had anything new .
how do I look ? awful !
just awful . why , what &apos;s the matter ?
this war has stopped being a joke ... when a girl like you doesn &apos;t know how to wear the latest fashion .
Oh , Rhett , let me do it .
but , Rhett , I don &apos;t know how I &apos;d dare wear it . you will , though .
and another thing . those pantalets .
I don &apos;t know a woman in Paris who wears pantalets anymore .
Oh , what do they ... You shouldn &apos;t talk about such things . you little hypocrite .
I really can &apos;t go on accepting these gifts , though you are awfully kind . I &apos;m not kind .
I never give anything without expecting something in return . I always get paid . if you think I &apos;ll marry you to pay for the bonnet , I won &apos;t .
don &apos;t flatter yourself . I &apos;m not a marrying man .
well , I won &apos;t kiss you for it , either .
open your eyes and look at me .
no , I don &apos;t think I will kiss you ... although you need kissing badly .
that &apos;s what &apos;s wrong with you . you should be kissed , and often .
and by someone who knows how .
Oh , and I suppose you think you &apos;re the proper person .
I might be , if the right moment ever came . you &apos;re a conceited , black-hearted varmint , Rhett Butler .
because I &apos;m the only man over 16 and under 60 ... who &apos;s around to show you a good time .
but cheer up , the war can &apos;t last much longer . really , Rhett ? why ?
there &apos;s a battle going on right now that ought to pretty well fix things ... one way or the other .
is Ashley in it ?
you haven &apos;t gotten the wooden-headed Mr. Wilkes out of your mind .
Yes , I suppose he &apos;s in it . Oh , but tell me , Rhett , where is it ?
some little town in Pennsylvania called Gettysburg .
Casualty list .
Oh , Scarlett , you &apos;re so sweet to worry about Ashley like this for me .
I must go to her .
don &apos;t , my dear , not here .
let &apos;s go home .
Dr. Meade , not ...
Yes , our boy , Darcy .
I was making these mittens for him .
he won &apos;t need them now . mother , I &apos;m going to enlist ! I &apos;ll show them .
I never heard of anything so silly . it &apos;s a black day , Scarlett .
you haven &apos;t had bad news , have you ?
Ashley &apos;s safe . I &apos;m glad , for Mrs. Wilkes &apos; sake .
Rhett , there are so many others .
any of your friends ? just about every family in the county .
the Tarleton boys , Rhett , both of them . Yes , look at them .
all these poor tragic people .
the South &apos;s sinking to its knees .
it &apos;ll never rise again .
the cause ...
the cause of living in the past is dying right in front of us . I never heard you talk like that before .
waste always makes me angry .
and that &apos;s what all this is , sheer waste .
but don &apos;t you be downcast .
Ashley Wilkes is still alive to come home to the women who love him ... both of them .
Oh , you &apos;re here .
merry Christmas , Ashley .
come on , old gentleman , come on . we &apos;ve got all your wives .
we &apos;ve got all your little chicks . you got nobody to worry your head about leaving .
come on .
now you just stand still so you can be a Christmas gift for the white folks .
now hold on . hold on ! don &apos;t go getting so uppity ... even if you is the last chicken in Atlanta .
let &apos;s not talk about the war .
let &apos;s talk about Twelve Oaks , and Tara , and all the times before the war . can we have the wine , Aunt Pittypat ?
why did you say there wasn &apos;t enough , Uncle Peter ?
there &apos;s plenty .
it &apos;s the very last of my father &apos;s fine Madeira .
he got it from his uncle , Admiral Will Hamilton of Savannah ... who married his cousin , Jessica Carroll of Carrollton ... who was his second cousin once removed and a kin to the Wilkeses , too .
I saved it to wish Ashley a Merry Christmas .
but you mustn &apos;t drink it all at once because it is the last .
I meant it , my dear .
it was a lovely Christmas gift .
only generals have tunics like this nowadays .
I &apos;m so happy you like it , dear .
where did you get the cloth ? it was sent to me by a Charleston lady .
I nursed her son while he was in the hospital , Ashley , before he died and ...
Oh , you will take good care of it , won &apos;t you ? you won &apos;t let it get torn .
promise me . you mustn &apos;t worry .
I &apos;ll bring it back to you without any holes in it , I promise .
good night , my dear .
is it time yet , Uncle Peter , for Mr. Ashley to leave ?
pretty quick now , Miss Scarlett .
she isn &apos;t going to the depot with him ? she hasn &apos;t changed her mind ? no , ma &apos;am .
she &apos;s laying down .
she &apos;s so upset Mr. Wilkes told her she can &apos;t even come downstairs .
Ashley !
all right . Oh , Ashley , I &apos;ve got a present for you , too .
why , Scarlett , it &apos;s beautiful .
tie it on me , my dear .
while Melly was making your new tunic , I made this to go with it . you made it yourself ? well , then I shall value it all the more .
you know there &apos;s nothing I wouldn &apos;t do for you .
there &apos;s something you can do for me .
what is it ? will you look after Melanie for me ?
she &apos;s so frail and gentle and she loves you so much . you see , if I were killed and she ...
you say one for me . we shall need all our prayers now the end is coming .
the end ? the end of the war .
and the end of our world , Scarlett .
but , Ashley , you don &apos;t think the Yankees are beating us ?
Scarlett , my men are barefooted now ... and the snow in Virginia is deep .
when I see them ... and I see the Yankees coming and coming , always more and more ...
well , when the end does come I shall be far away .
it &apos;ll be a comfort to me to know that she has you .
you will promise , won &apos;t you ? Yes .
is that all , Ashley ?
all except goodbye .
Oh , Ashley , I can &apos;t let you go .
- You must be brave ... - No ... You must .
how else can I bear going ?
Oh , Scarlett , you are so fine and strong and beautiful .
Ashley , kiss me .
kiss me goodbye !
no , Scarlett .
Oh , Ashley , I love you .
I &apos;ve always loved you . I &apos;ve never loved anyone else .
I only married Charles just to hurt you .
Ashley , tell me you love me .
I &apos;ll live on it the rest of my life .
Goodbye .
when the war is over , Ashley .
when the war is over .
when we were little , my brother Jeff and I used to ... I told you about my brother Jeff , didn &apos;t I , ma &apos;am ?
I know I did . he ...
since Bull Run we haven &apos;t heard anything and ...
please , we must have your temperature now .
just take this in your mouth and not talk anymore .
not just now . Melanie , I &apos;m so tired .
I &apos;ve got to go home .
aren &apos;t you tired , Melanie ? no , I &apos;m not tired , Scarlett .
this might be ... Ashley .
and only strangers here to comfort him .
no , I &apos;m not tired , Scarlett .
they could all be ...
Ashley .
I &apos;ve been sitting by this curb one solid hour waiting to speak to you , Miss Wilkes .
go on , you trash , don &apos;t you be pestering these ladies . don &apos;t talk to her , Melly .
it &apos;s all right , Scarlett .
who are you ? my name &apos;s Belle Watling . but that don &apos;t matter .
I expect you think I &apos;ve got no business here . hadn &apos;t you best tell me what you want to see me about ?
first time I come here , I says , &quot; Belle , you &apos;re a nurse . &quot;
but the ladies didn &apos;t want my kind of nursing .
well , they was more than likely right . then I tried giving them money .
what are you doing here ? haven &apos;t you been told twice already ? this time I &apos;m conversing with Miss Wilkes .
you might as well take my money , Miss Wilkes .
it &apos;s good money , even if it is mine .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;re very generous . no , I &apos;m not .
I &apos;m a Confederate like everybody else , that &apos;s all .
of course you are .
some folks here wouldn &apos;t feel that way .
but maybe they ain &apos;t as good Christians as you .
look , Mrs. Meade .
it &apos;s a great deal of money . $ 10 , $ 20 , $ 30 , $ 50 .
and it &apos;s not our paper money . it &apos;s gold .
let me see that handkerchief .
&quot; R. B. &quot;
and she &apos;s driving away in Rhett Butler &apos;s carriage !
Oh , if I just wasn &apos;t a lady what wouldn &apos;t I tell that varmint !
&quot; the Lord is my shepherd . I shall not want .
&quot; he maketh me to lie down in green pastures .
&quot; he leadeth ... &quot; He restoreth my soul .
&quot; he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name &apos;s sake .
&quot; Yeah , though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death ...
&quot; I will fear no evil . &quot; for thou art with me .
sorry , son , we haven &apos;t got anything to give you .
these animals is driving me crazy ! what luck !
you &apos;ve got my jack ! give me an ace and I &apos;ll start another war !
I &apos;ll bid the moon !
I &apos;ll never see you or Pa again .
this leg &apos;s got to come off , soldier . no , no !
leave me alone ! I &apos;m sorry , soldier .
we &apos;re all run out of chloroform , Dr. Meade . then we &apos;ll have to operate without it .
no , no ! leave me alone !
you can &apos;t do it .
I won &apos;t let you do it to me ! tell Dr. Wilson to take this leg off immediately . it &apos;s gangrene .
no , no ! don &apos;t !
I haven &apos;t seen my family in three days .
I &apos;m going home for half an hour . orderly !
give me a lift . nurse , you can free this bed .
Miss Scarlett !
why , Frank Kennedy ! Miss Suellen , is she well ?
when did they bring you in ? you all right ? are you badly hurt ?
- She &apos;s all right , but I ... Dr. Wilson needs you in the operating room .
he &apos;s going to take off that leg .
better hurry .
I &apos;ll be back .
no , no , leave me alone !
no , no , I can &apos;t stand it !
no don &apos;t !
don &apos;t cut !
don &apos;t cut ! don &apos;t , don &apos;t !
please !
where &apos;s the nurse ?
Dr. Wilson &apos;s waiting . let him wait ! I &apos;m going home !
I &apos;ve done enough . I don &apos;t want any more men dying !
I don &apos;t want any more !
Scarlett !
Scarlett !
climb into this buggy . this is no day for walking .
you &apos;ll get run over . Oh , Rhett !
drive me to Aunt Pitty &apos;s , please . panic &apos;s a pretty sight , isn &apos;t it ?
that &apos;s just another of Gen. Sherman &apos;s calling cards .
he &apos;ll be paying us a visit soon .
I &apos;ve got to get out of here before the Yankees come !
and leave your work at the hospital ?
Mexico , London , Paris ... - With you ? - Yes , ma &apos;am .
I figure we belong together , being the same sort .
I &apos;ve been waiting for you to grow up and get that sad-eyed Ashley out of your heart .
well , I hear Mrs. Wilkes is going to have a baby in another month or so . it &apos;ll be hard loving a man with a wife and baby clinging to him .
well , here we are .
are you going with me , or are you getting out ?
I hate and despise you , Rhett Butler , and I &apos;ll hate and despise you till I die .
Oh , no , you won &apos;t , Scarlett .
not that long .
Miss Scarlett !
Miss Scarlett !
folks is all going to Macon and folks is running away and running away .
I can &apos;t bear it !
those cannon balls right in my ears !
I faint every time I hear one !
Uncle Peter , look out for that trunk ! but , Aunt Pitty , you aren &apos;t leaving ?
I may be a coward , but oh , dear ! Yankees in Georgia !
how did they ever get in ? I &apos;m going , too . Prissy , go pack my things .
get them , quick ! wait , Aunt Pitty , I won &apos;t be a minute . Scarlett , do you really think you ought to ?
you ain &apos;t planning on running away ? and don &apos;t you dare try to stop me .
I &apos;m never going back to that hospital .
I &apos;ve had enough of smelling death and rot and death . I &apos;m going home .
I want my mother . my mother needs me . now you &apos;ve got to listen to me .
you &apos;ve got to stay . Melanie needs you .
Oh , bother Melanie . she &apos;s ill already .
she shouldn &apos;t even be having a baby . she may have a difficult time .
can &apos;t we take her along ?
do you want her to take that chance ? to be jounced over rough roads ... and have her baby ahead of time , in a buggy ?
it isn &apos;t my baby !
you take care of her ! Scarlett !
we haven &apos;t enough doctors ... much less nurses to look after a sick woman .
you &apos;ve got to stay for Melanie . what for ?
I don &apos;t know anything about babies being born !
I knows , I knows . I knows how to do it .
I &apos;s done it lots and lots .
let me , Doctor , let me .
I can do everything .
- Good . then I &apos;ll rely on you to help us .
- Yes , Doctor . Ashley &apos;s fighting in the field , fighting for the cause .
he may never come back . he may die .
Scarlett , we owe him a well-born child .
Ashley . if you &apos;re coming , Scarlett , hurry !
I promised Ashley ... something .
then you &apos;ll stay ?
good . go along , Miss Pittypat .
Scarlett &apos;s staying .
go on , Uncle Peter .
Oh , dear , I don &apos;t know what to do .
it &apos;s like the end of the world .
Uncle Peter , my smelling salts .
Melanie , it &apos;s all your fault !
I hate you , I hate you !
and I hate your baby !
if only I hadn &apos;t promised Ashley !
if only I hadn &apos;t promised him !
stop !
stop , please stop ! is it true ? are the Yankees coming ?
I &apos;m afraid so , ma &apos;am . the Army &apos;s pulling out . pulling out of Atlanta ?
it can &apos;t be true ! it can &apos;t be true ! what &apos;ll I do ?
better refugee south right quick , ma &apos;am .
if you &apos;ll excuse me , ma &apos;am .
Prissy ! Prissy , come here !
pack my things and Miss Melanie &apos;s , too . we &apos;re going to Tara right away . the Yankees are coming !
Yes , ma &apos;am .
Scarlett ! Scarlett !
Melly , we &apos;re going to ...
Melly !
but , but ...
but the Yankees are coming .
poor Scarlett .
you &apos;d be at Tara now with your mother , wouldn &apos;t you ... if it weren &apos;t for me ?
Oh , Scarlett , darling ... you &apos;ve been so good to me .
no sister could have been sweeter .
I &apos;ve been lying here thinking ... if I should die ... will you take my baby ?
Oh , fiddle-dee-dee , Melly .
aren &apos;t things bad enough without you talking about dying ? - I &apos;ll send for Dr. Meade right away .
- Not yet , Scarlett . I couldn &apos;t let Dr. Meade sit here for hours , while ...
- while all those poor , wounded boys ... - Prissy !
Prissy ! come here , quick ! go get Dr. Meade !
the baby ! well , don &apos;t stand there like a scared goat .
run !
hurry ! I &apos;ll sell you South , I will ! I swear I will !
where &apos;s that Prissy ?
this room &apos;s like an oven already ... and it isn &apos;t noon yet .
Oh , don &apos;t worry , Melly .
mother says it always seems like the doctor will never come .
if I don &apos;t take a strap to that Prissy !
Oh , Melly .
you know what I heard about Maybelle Merriwether ?
you remember that funny-looking beau of hers ?
the one with a uniform like ladies &apos; red flannel underdrawers .
you don &apos;t have to keep on talking for my sake , Scarlett .
I know how worried you are .
Oh , Melly , I &apos;ll just go and fetch you some cool water .
you &apos;re as slow as molasses in January . and where &apos;s Dr. Meade ? - I ain &apos;t never seen him , Miss Scarlett .
- What ? no , ma &apos;am .
he ain &apos;t at the hospital . a man , he told me the doctor &apos;s down at the car shed with the wounded soldiers ...
well , why didn &apos;t you go after him ? Miss Scarlett .
there &apos;s folks dying down there and I &apos;s scared of dead folks .
Oh , you go sit by Miss Melly .
and don &apos;t you be upsetting her , or I &apos;ll whip the hide off you !
- Have you seen Dr. Meade ?
- Side , lady , please . Dr. Meade !
we &apos;ve got work to do . but Melly &apos;s having her baby .
you &apos;ve got to come with me !
I can &apos;t leave these men for a baby ! they &apos;re dying , hundreds of them ! get some woman to help you .
is the doctor come ?
no , he can &apos;t come .
Oh , Miss Scarlett , Miss Melly bad off .
he can &apos;t come . there &apos;s nobody to come .
Prissy , you &apos;ve got to manage without the doctor . I &apos;ll help you .
Oh , lordy , Miss Scarlett . well , what is it ?
lordy , we &apos;ve got to have a doctor .
I don &apos;t know nothing about birthing babies .
- What do you mean ? - I don &apos;t know ...
you told me you knew everything about it .
I don &apos;t know how come I told such a lie .
ma ain &apos;t never let me around when folks was having them .
Scarlett ! Scarlett !
Oh , Miss Scarlett ...
stop it ! go light a fire in the stove !
coming , Melly . coming .
go , Scarlett , before the Yankees get here .
I &apos;m not afraid . you know I won &apos;t leave you . it &apos;s no use .
I &apos;m going to die .
don &apos;t be a goose , Melly . hold on to me .
hold on to me . talk to me , Scarlett . please talk to me .
don &apos;t try to be brave , Melly .
yell all you want , there &apos;s nobody to hear .
ma says that if you puts a knife under the bed , it cuts the pain in two .
Capt. Butler !
Capt. Butler !
who do you want ?
Capt. Butler . he &apos;s upstairs . Belle Watling &apos;s giving a party .
thank you .
Capt. Butler !
Oh , Capt. Butler ! what &apos;s all the rumpus about ? I &apos;s got a message for Capt. Butler , Miss Watling !
Capt. Butler , you come out here in the streets to me .
what is it , Prissy ? Miss Scarlett , she done sent me for you .
a fine baby boy ... and Miss Scarlett and me , we brung him .
do you mean to tell me that Scarlett ...
well , it was mostly me , Capt. Butler , only Miss Scarlett ... she helped me a little , but I don &apos;t expect no doctor could have done no better !
only Miss Melly , she feeling kind of poorly now it &apos;s all over !
Yes , I can believe that !
Oh , Capt. Butler , the Yankees is here !
please come and bring your carriage for us right away .
I &apos;m sorry , Prissy , but the Army took my horse and carriage .
you &apos;d better come upstairs . I &apos;ll see what I can do .
Oh , no , Capt. Butler !
ma would wear me out with a cornstalk if I was to go into Miss Watling &apos;s .
any of you beauties know where I can steal a horse for a good cause ?
- Whoa , Marse Robert .
- Is that you , Rhett ?
- We &apos;s here , Miss Scarlett . we &apos;s here ! - Rhett , I knew you &apos;d come .
nice weather we &apos;re having . Prissy tells me you &apos;re planning on taking a trip .
if you make any jokes now , I &apos;ll kill you !
don &apos;t tell me you &apos;re frightened .
I &apos;m scared to death . if you had the sense of a goat , you &apos;d be scared too .
- Oh , the Yankees . - No , not yet .
that &apos;s what &apos;s left of our Army , blowing up the ammunition ... so the Yankees won &apos;t get it .
we &apos;ve got to get out of here . at your service , madam .
just where are you figuring on going ?
home , to Tara . they &apos;ve been fighting all day around Tara .
do you think you can parade through the Yankee Army ... with a sick woman , a baby , and a simple-minded darky ... or do you intend leaving them behind ?
you can &apos;t stop me ! don &apos;t you know it &apos;s dangerous jouncing Mrs. Wilkes over miles of open country ?
I want my mother !
I want to go home to Tara !
Tara &apos;s probably been burned to the ground . the woods are full of stragglers from both armies .
the least they &apos;ll do is take the horse away from you . it isn &apos;t much of an animal , but I had trouble stealing it .
I &apos;ll kill you if you try to stop me . I will , I will !
I will !
all right , darling , all right . now you shall go home .
I guess anybody who did what you &apos;ve done today can take care of Sherman .
here , now . stop crying .
now blow your nose like a good little girl .
there .
Prissy ! what are you doing ?
I &apos;s packing , Miss Scarlett .
stop it and come get the baby . Yes , ma &apos;am .
Melly !
Mrs. Wilkes , we &apos;re taking you to Tara .
Tara ... - It &apos;s the only way , Melly .
- No . Sherman will burn the house over our heads if we stay .
it &apos;s all right , Melly . my baby .
my poor baby .
have you the strength to put your arms around my neck ?
I think so .
never mind .
Oh , Ashley , Charles ... What is it ? what does she want ?
she wants us to bring them . get them .
our gallant lads must have set fire to the warehouses near the depot .
there &apos;s enough ammunition in the boxcars to blow us to Tara .
we &apos;ll have to hurry to get across the tracks . - You &apos;re not going that way !
- We have to . the McDonough Road &apos;s the only one the Yankees haven &apos;t cut yet .
Oh , wait .
I forgot to lock the front door . what are you laughing at ? at you , locking the Yankees out .
Oh , dear , I wish they &apos;d hurry .
I wouldn &apos;t be in such a hurry to see them go if I were you . with them goes the last semblance of law and order .
there &apos;s a horse !
down the alley , cut them off .
give me that horse .
we &apos;ll have to make a dash for it before the fire reaches that ammunition .
sorry , but you &apos;ll like it better if you don &apos;t see anything .
take a good look , my dear .
it &apos;s a historic moment . you can tell your grandchildren ... how you watched the old South disappear one night .
let the horse breathe a bit .
Mrs. Wilkes .
Miss Melly done fainted way back , Capt. Butler . well , she &apos;s probably better off .
I &apos;m going , my dear , to join the Army . you &apos;re joking !
I could kill you for scaring me so !
I &apos;m very serious , Scarlett .
I &apos;m going to join up with our brave lads in gray . but they &apos;re running away !
no . they &apos;ll turn and make a last stand , if I know anything about them .
when they do , I &apos;ll be with them . a little late , but &quot; Better late ... &quot;
Rhett , you must be joking ! selfish to the end , aren &apos;t you ?
thinking only of your own precious hide , with never a thought for the noble cause .
you should die of shame to leave me here alone and helpless !
you helpless ?
heaven help the Yankees if they capture you !
I want to say goodbye .
no ! climb down .
Oh , Rhett , please don &apos;t go . you can &apos;t leave me , please .
I &apos;ll never forgive you !
I &apos;m not asking you to forgive me .
I &apos;ll never understand or forgive myself .
and if a bullet gets me , so help me , I &apos;ll laugh at myself for being an idiot .
but there &apos;s one thing I do know ... and that is that I love you , Scarlett .
in spite of you , me and the whole silly world going to pieces around us ...
I love you ... because we &apos;re alike .
bad lots , both of us .
selfish and shrewd ... but able to look things in the eyes and call them by their right names .
don &apos;t hold me like that !
Scarlett , look at me .
I love you more than I &apos;ve ever loved any woman .
and I &apos;ve waited longer for you than I &apos;ve ever waited for any woman .
let me alone !
here &apos;s a soldier of the South who loves you , Scarlett ... wants to feel your arms around him ... wants to carry the memory of your kisses into battle with him .
never mind about loving me .
you &apos;re a woman sending a soldier to his death with a beautiful memory .
Scarlett , kiss me .
kiss me , once .
you low-down , cowardly , nasty thing , you !
they were right ! everybody was right ! you aren &apos;t a gentleman !
a minor point at such a moment .
here .
if anyone lays a hand on that nag , shoot him .
but don &apos;t make a mistake and shoot the nag .
Oh , go on . I want you to go .
I hope a cannonball lands slap on you .
I hope you &apos;re blown into a million pieces !
never mind the rest . I follow your general idea . and when I &apos;m dead on the altar of my country ...
I hope your conscience hurts you .
Goodbye , Scarlett .
come on , you !
we &apos;re going home .
Oh , my poor baby .
Ashley , I &apos;m glad you &apos;re not here to see this .
the Yankees ! the dirty Yankees !
we don &apos;t need no cow , Miss Scarlett .
we &apos;ll be home soon , and I &apos;s scared of cows .
Miss Scarlett , he &apos;s dead ! I can &apos;t see the house ! is it there ?
mother ! mother !
I &apos;m home . mother !
mother ! I &apos;m home .
I &apos;m home ! I &apos;m home !
Katie . Katie Scarlett .
Oh , darling .
- Mammy , I &apos;m home . - Honey , honey child !
Oh , Mammy , I &apos;m so ...
where &apos;s Mother ?
why ... Miss Suellen and Miss Carreen , they was sick with the typhoid .
they had it bad , but they &apos;s doing all right now .
just weak like little kittens . but where &apos;s Mother ? well ...
Miss Ellen , she went down to nurse that Emmie Slattery , that white trash ... and she took down with it , too .
- And last night , she ...
mother .
Miss Scarlett , honey .
if there &apos;s anything I can do , Miss Scarlett ...
what did you do with Miss Melly ? don &apos;t you worry your pretty head about Miss Melly , child .
I done slapped her in bed already , along with the baby .
you better put that cow I brought into the barn , Pork .
the Yankees done burned it for firewood . they used the house for their headquarters . they camped all around the place .
I &apos;d like to be drunk .
Oh , Pa .
what are those papers ?
bonds . they &apos;re all we &apos;ve saved .
all we have left . bonds .
what kind of bonds , Pa ?
why , Confederate bonds , of course , daughter .
Confederate bonds .
what good are they to anybody ?
I &apos;ll not have you talking like that , Katie Scarlett .
Oh , Pa , what are we going to do with no money and nothing to eat ?
we must ask your mother .
that &apos;s it !
we must ask Mrs. O &apos;Hara .
- Ask Mother ?
- Yes . Mrs. O &apos;Hara will know what &apos;s to be done .
Oh , Pa ... don &apos;t worry about anything .
Katie Scarlett &apos;s home .
Miss Scarlett .
what are we gonna to do with nothing to feed those sick folks and that child ?
I don &apos;t know , Mammy .
I don &apos;t know .
we ain &apos;t got nothing but radishes in the garden .
Miss Scarlett , Miss Suellen and Miss Carreen ... they &apos;s fussing to be sponged off .
where are the other servants , Mammy ? Miss Scarlett , there &apos;s only just me and Pork left .
the others went off to the war or runned away .
I can &apos;t take care of that baby and sick folks , too .
I &apos;s only got two hands .
who &apos;s going to milk that cow , Miss Scarlett ?
we &apos;s houseworkers .
as God is my witness ...
as God is my witness , they &apos;re not going to lick me .
English
don &apos;t you ever dare say you hate Tara again !
Katie Scarlett , there &apos;s something I must speak to you about . Yes , Pa , what is it ?
I &apos;ve been talking to Prissy and Mammy .
I don &apos;t like the way you &apos;re treating them .
you must be firm with inferiors , but you must be gentle with them ... especially darkies .
Yes , Pa , I know . but I &apos;m not asking them to do anything I &apos;m not doing myself . nevertheless , Katie Scarlett , I don &apos;t like it .
Oh , I didn &apos;t think of it that way .
who &apos;s there ? Halt or I &apos;ll shoot .
you &apos;re alone , little lady ?
you ain &apos;t very friendly , are you ?
you got anything else besides these earbobs ?
what have you got hidden in your hand ?
Scarlett , you killed him .
I &apos;m glad you killed him .
Scarlett , what happened ?
what is it , Scarlett ?
what is it ?
don &apos;t be scared , chickens .
what a cool liar you are , Melly .
we &apos;ve got to get him out of here and bury him .
if the Yankees find him here , they &apos;ll ... I didn &apos;t see anyone else . I think he must be a deserter .
but even so , we &apos;ve got to hide him . they might hear about it , and then they &apos;d come and get you .
I could bury him in the arbor where the ground is soft ... but how will I get him out of here ?
do you think it would be dishonest if we went through his haversack ?
I &apos;m ashamed I didn &apos;t think of that myself .
you take the haversack , I &apos;ll search his pockets .
you look .
I &apos;m feeling a little weak . Melly , I think it &apos;s full of money !
Oh , Melly , look ! look ! $ 10 , $ 20 , $ 30 , $ 40 ...
don &apos;t stop to count it now . we haven &apos;t got time . do you realize this means we &apos;ll have something to eat ?
look in his other pockets . hurry , hurry !
if he bleeds across the yard , we can &apos;t hide it .
give me your nightgown , Melly . I &apos;ll wad it around his head .
don &apos;t be silly . I won &apos;t look at you .
if I had my petticoat or pantalets , I &apos;d use them .
thank heavens I &apos;m not that modest .
now go back to bed . you &apos;ll be dead if you don &apos;t .
I &apos;ll clean up the mess when I &apos;ve buried him .
no , I &apos;ll clean it up .
well , I guess I &apos;ve done murder .
I won &apos;t think about that now .
I &apos;ll think about that tomorrow .
Katie Scarlett ! Katie Scarlett !
it &apos;s over ! it &apos;s over !
it &apos;s all over ! the war !
Lee surrendered . - It &apos;s not possible .
- Why did we ever fight ? Ashley will be coming home .
Yes , Ashley will be coming home .
we &apos;ll plant more cotton .
cotton ought to go sky-high next year !
while we were marching through Georgia
hurrah , hurrah ! we bring the jubilee
hurrah , hurrah ! the flag that makes you free
so we sing the chorus from Atlanta to the sea
while we were marching through Georgia Get out of the road , rebel !
get out of the way !
have you room in your carriage for a dying man ? I got no room for any Southern scum , alive or dead .
get out of the way . I reckon he &apos;d rather try and walk it at that .
Giddap ! jump , you gray-backed beggars ! act like they won the war !
now you come on and give me them pants , Mr. Kennedy .
come on .
you scrub yourself with that strong lye soap before I scrubs you myself .
I &apos;m gonna put these britches in the boiling pot .
the whole Confederate Army &apos;s got the same trouble :
crawling clothes and dysentery .
it &apos;s humiliating , how you treat Mr. Kennedy .
you &apos;d be a sight more humiliated if Mr. Kennedy &apos;s lice gets on you !
come on , Beau .
we must leave this gentleman alone because he &apos;s tired and he &apos;s hungry .
I don &apos;t mind , ma &apos;am . good to see a youngster again .
nice little fellow . another two years of war and we could have had him with us in Cobb &apos;s Legion .
were you in Cobb &apos;s Legion ? Yes , ma &apos;am .
why , then , you must know my husband , Maj. Wilkes .
Oh , yes , ma &apos;am .
he was captured at Spotsylvania , I think . captured !
Oh , thank heavens , then he isn &apos;t ...
Oh , my poor Ashley in a Yankee prison ! Melanie .
Yes , Scarlett , I &apos;m coming . come along , Beau .
I &apos;ll watch out for him , ma &apos;am .
we &apos;re good friends . Oh , thank you .
I &apos;d sooner have a plague of locusts here . don &apos;t scold me , Scarlett , please .
I &apos;ve just heard that Ashley was taken prisoner .
- Ashley , a prisoner ? - Yes . and maybe if he &apos;s alive and well , he &apos;s on some Northern road right now .
and maybe some Northern woman is giving him a share of her dinner ... and helping my beloved to come back home to me .
I hope so , Melly . Miss Scarlett .
Miss Scarlett , I want to take up something with your pa , but ... he doesn &apos;t seem to ...
Miss Scarlett , I was aiming to ask for Suellen .
do you mean to tell me you haven &apos;t asked for her ... after all these years she &apos;s been counting on you ?
well , the truth is , I &apos;m so much older than she is , and ...
well , now I haven &apos;t a cent to my name .
who has nowadays ?
Miss Scarlett , if true love carries any weight with you ... you can be sure your sister will be rich in that .
I &apos;ll go out somewhere and get myself a little business if we &apos;re engaged .
as soon as I get on my feet again ... All right , Frank .
I &apos;m sure I can speak for Pa .
you go ask her now . Oh , thank you , Miss Scarlett .
excuse me , excuse me .
Scarlett , what seems to be the trouble with Mr. Kennedy ?
more trouble than he guesses .
he &apos;s finally asked for Suellen &apos;s hand .
Oh , I &apos;m so glad . it &apos;s a pity he can &apos;t marry her now .
at least there &apos;d be one less mouth to feed .
Oh , another one . I hope this one isn &apos;t hungry . he &apos;ll be hungry .
I &apos;ll tell Prissy to get an extra plate ...
Ashley !
Ashley ! darling !
Miss Scarlett !
don &apos;t spoil it , Miss Scarlett . turn me loose , you fool !
turn me loose , it &apos;s Ashley !
he &apos;s her husband , ain &apos;t he ?
- Miss Scarlett , ma &apos;am . - High time you got back .
- Did you get the horse shod ? - Yes , he shod all right . fine thing when a horse can get shoes and humans can &apos;t .
here , stir this soap .
Yes , ma &apos;am . Miss Scarlett , ma &apos;am .
I gotta know how much money have you got left , in gold . $ 10 .
why ? that won &apos;t be enough .
what in heaven &apos;s name are you talking about ?
well , Miss Scarlett , I seed that old no-count white-trash Wilkerson ... that used to be Mr. Gerald &apos;s overseer here .
he &apos;s a regular Yankee now , and he was making a brag ... that his carpetbagger friends done run the taxes way up sky-high on Tara .
but how much more have we got to pay ?
I hear the taxman say $ 300 . $ 300 !
might just as well be $ 3 million . but we gotta raise it , that &apos;s all .
Yes , ma &apos;am . how ?
I &apos;ll go ask Mr. Ashley . Oh , he ain &apos;t got no $ 300 , Miss Scarlett .
well , I can ask him if I want to , can &apos;t I ?
asking ain &apos;t getting .
Ashley !
they say Abe Lincoln got his start splitting rails .
think what heights I may climb to once I get the knack .
the Yankees want $ 300 more in taxes .
what shall we do ? Ashley , what &apos;s to become of us ?
what becomes of people when their civilization breaks up ?
those who have brains and courage come through all right .
those that haven &apos;t are winnowed out .
for heaven &apos;s sake , don &apos;t stand there talking nonsense at me ... when it &apos;s us who are being winnowed out .
you &apos;re right , Scarlett .
here I am talking tommyrot about civilization ... when your Tara &apos;s in danger .
you &apos;ve come to me for help , and I &apos;ve no help to give you .
Oh , Scarlett , I ... I &apos;m a coward .
you , Ashley , a coward ?
what are you afraid of ?
Oh , mostly of life becoming too real for me , I suppose .
not that I mind splitting rails ... but I do mind very much losing the beauty of that life I loved .
if the war hadn &apos;t come , I &apos;d have spent my life happily buried at Twelve Oaks .
but the war did come .
I saw my boyhood friends blown to bits .
I saw men crumple up in agony when I shot them .
I can never make you understand because you don &apos;t know the meaning of fear . you never mind facing realities ... and you never want to escape from them as I do .
I &apos;ve weeded and hoed and picked cotton until I can &apos;t stand it another minute .
I tell you , Ashley , the South is dead .
it &apos;s dead .
the Yankees and the carpetbaggers have got it and there &apos;s nothing left for us .
Oh , Ashley ... let &apos;s run away .
we &apos;d go to Mexico . they want officers in the Mexican Army .
we could be so happy there . I &apos;d work for you , I &apos;d do anything for you . you know you don &apos;t love Melanie .
Dr. Meade told me she couldn &apos;t have any more children and I could give you ... Can &apos;t we ever forget that day at Twelve Oaks ?
do you think I could ever forget it ? have you forgotten it ?
can you honestly say you don &apos;t love me ? - No . I don &apos;t love you .
- It &apos;s a lie !
even if it is , do you think I &apos;d leave Melanie and the baby , break Melanie &apos;s heart ? you couldn &apos;t leave your father and the girls .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re talking this way . you &apos;ve carried the load for all of us ... but from now on I &apos;m going to be more help to you , I promise .
there &apos;s only one way you can help me .
take me away . there &apos;s nothing to keep us here .
nothing except honor .
you do love me , you do love me . - Say it , say it .
- Don &apos;t , don &apos;t .
you love me , you love me . we won &apos;t do this , I tell you . it won &apos;t happen again .
I &apos;m going to take Melanie and the baby , and go .
say it , you love me .
all right , I &apos;ll say it .
I love your courage and your stubbornness .
so much that I could have forgotten the best wife a man ever had .
but , Scarlett , I &apos;m not going to forget her .
then there &apos;s nothing left for me .
nothing to fight for .
nothing to live for .
Yes , there is something .
something you love better than me ... though you may not know it .
Tara !
Yes , I ...
you needn &apos;t go .
it won &apos;t happen again .
get off those steps , you trashy wench ! get off this land ! you can &apos;t speak that way to my wife .
wife !
high time you made her your wife .
who baptized your other brats after you killed my mother ?
we came out here to pay a friendly call and talk a little business with old friends .
friends ! when were we ever friends with the likes of you ?
still high and mighty , ain &apos;t you ? well , I know all about you . I know your father &apos;s turned idiot .
and I come here to offer to buy the place from you ... to make you a right good offer . Emmy &apos;s had a hankering to live here . get off this place , you dirty Yankee .
you high-flying Irish will find out who &apos;s running things around here ... when you get sold out for taxes .
I &apos;ll buy this place lock , stock and barrel and I &apos;ll live in it .
but I &apos;ll wait for the Sheriff &apos;s sale .
that &apos;s all of Tara you &apos;ll ever get !
you &apos;ll be sorry for that .
we &apos;ll be back !
I &apos;ll show you who the owner of Tara is .
Pa , come back !
Pa , come back ! Pa !
Pa !
Lordsy , Miss Scarlett .
that &apos;s Mr. Gerald &apos;s watch . you take it .
it &apos;s for you . Pa &apos;d want you to have it .
you ain &apos;t got no business parting from this watch now , Miss Scarlett .
you needs all your valuables to sell for that tax money .
you think I &apos;d sell Pa &apos;s watch ?
and don &apos;t cry .
I can stand everybody &apos;s tears but yours .
Oh , Mammy , Mammy .
you been brave so long , Miss Scarlett , you just gotta go on being brave .
I can &apos;t think about Pa .
I can &apos;t think of anything but that $ 300 . ain &apos;t no good thinking about that , Miss Scarlett .
ain &apos;t nobody got that much money .
nobody but Yankees and scalawags got that much money now .
Rhett !
Oh , Mammy , I &apos;m so thin and pale and ...
I haven &apos;t any clothes .
Scoot up to the attic and get down Ma &apos;s old box of dress patterns .
what you up to with Miss Ellen &apos;s portiere ?
you &apos;ll make me a new dress . not with Miss Ellen &apos;s portieres .
not while I got breath in me . great balls of fire ! they &apos;re my portieres now .
I &apos;m going to Atlanta for that $ 300 and I &apos;ve got to go looking like a queen .
- Who going to Atlanta with you ? - I &apos;m going alone . that &apos;s what you think .
I &apos;s going to Atlanta with you .
with you and that new dress .
now , Mammy , darling . no use to try to sweet-talk me , Miss Scarlett .
I &apos;s knowed you since I put the first pair of diapers on you .
I said I &apos;s going to Atlanta with you , and going I is . kings and treys , huh ?
too good for me , Major !
pity we couldn &apos;t have fought the war out in a poker game .
you &apos;d have done better than Gen. Grant with far less effort . what is it , Corporal ?
sir , there &apos;s a lady to see Capt. Butler .
says she &apos;s his sister .
another sister ?
this is a jail , not a harem , Capt. Butler .
no , Major , she ain &apos;t one of those . this one &apos;s got her mammy with her .
she has ?
I &apos;d like to see this one , Major , without her mammy .
let &apos;s see , my losses for the afternoon come to what ?
$ 340 .
my debts do mount up , don &apos;t they , Major ?
all right , Corporal . show Capt. Butler &apos;s sister to his cell .
thank you , Major . excuse me , gentlemen .
it &apos;s hard to be strict with a man who loses money so pleasantly .
- Rhett ! - Scarlett !
my dear little sister . it &apos;s all right , Corporal .
my sister has brought me no files or saws .
can I really kiss you now ? on the forehead like a good brother .
no , thanks . I &apos;ll wait and hope for better things .
Oh , Rhett , I was so distressed when I heard you were in jail . I simply couldn &apos;t sleep for thinking . it &apos;s not true they &apos;re going to hang you ?
would you be sorry ? - Oh , Rhett ! - Well , don &apos;t worry yet .
they have plotted some charge against me ... but they &apos;re really after my money . they think I made off with the Confederate Treasury .
well , did you ?
what a leading question .
but let &apos;s not talk about sordid things like money .
how good of you to come and see me .
and how pretty you look .
Oh , Rhett , how you do run on , teasing a country girl like me .
thank heavens you &apos;re not in rags .
I &apos;m tired of seeing women in rags .
turn around .
you look good enough to eat .
and prosperous , too . thank you , I &apos;ve been doing very well .
everybody &apos;s doing well at Tara , only ...
I got so bored I just thought I &apos;d treat myself to a visit to town .
you &apos;re a heartless creature . but that &apos;s part of your charm . you know you &apos;ve got more charm than the law allows .
now I didn &apos;t come here to talk silliness about me , Rhett .
I came because I was so miserable at the thought of you in trouble .
I was mad at you the night you left me on the road to Tara ... and I still haven &apos;t forgiven you .
Oh , Scarlett , don &apos;t say that . well , I must admit I might not be alive now , only for you .
and when I think of myself with everything I could possibly hope for ... and not a care in the world , and you here in this horrid jail ... and not even a human jail , Rhett , a horse jail .
Oh , listen to me trying to make jokes when ... when I really want to cry .
in a minute I shall cry .
Scarlett , can it be possible that ...
can what be possible , Rhett ?
that you &apos;ve grown a woman &apos;s heart , a real woman &apos;s heart ?
I have , Rhett . I know I have .
you know , it &apos;s worth being in jail just to hear you say that .
it &apos;s well worth it .
you can drop the moonlight and magnolias , Scarlett .
so things have been going well at Tara , have they ?
what have you done with your hands ? I went riding last week without my gloves .
these don &apos;t belong to a lady . you &apos;ve worked with them like a field hand .
why did you lie ? what are you up to ?
in another minute , I &apos;d almost believe you cared something .
but I do care .
suppose we get down to the truth .
you want something from me badly enough ... to put on quite a show in your velvets . what is it ?
I did lie to you when I said everything was all right .
things are just as bad as they possibly could be .
and you &apos;ve got millions , Rhett . what collateral are you offering ?
not good enough .
have you nothing better ?
you once said you loved me .
if you still love me , Rhett ... You haven &apos;t forgotten that I &apos;m not a marrying man ?
no , I haven &apos;t forgotten .
you &apos;ll never mean anything but misery to any man .
go on , insult me .
I don &apos;t care what you say , only give me the money . I won &apos;t let Tara go .
I can &apos;t let it go while there &apos;s a breath left in my body .
won &apos;t you please give me the money ?
I couldn &apos;t give you the money if I wanted to .
my funds are in Liverpool , not in Atlanta .
if I tried drawing a draft , the Yankees &apos;d be on me like a duck on a June bug .
so you see , my dear , you &apos;ve abased yourself to no purpose .
here , here , here , stop it !
want the Yankees to see you like this ? take your hands off me , you skunk .
you knew what I was going to say before I started . you knew you wouldn &apos;t lend me the money and yet you let me go on .
I enjoyed hearing what you had to say .
the only thing I &apos;m afraid of ... is that they won &apos;t hang you in time to pay the taxes on Tara .
tell him Belle Watling .
where you been lately ?
thought you &apos;d deserted Capt. Butler . Oh , I keep myself occupied . help me out .
I ain &apos;t never seen hair that color before in my life .
does you know a dyed-haired woman ? I wish I did know that one .
she &apos;d get my money for me .
no matter what they done to you in that jail ... they didn &apos;t do no more than you deserve ... for visiting white trash in a jail !
fresh and green . right off the farm .
Hey , what are you doing tonight , Susy ? that &apos;s one of them Georgia peaches .
there &apos;s nothing like that in Ohio .
- You know what we &apos;re going to do ? - What ? we &apos;re going to give every last one of you 40 acres and a mule !
- And a mule ? - Forty acres and a mule !
gee !
&apos;Cause we &apos;re your friends ... and you &apos;re gonna become voters ... and you &apos;re gonna vote like your friends do !
what &apos;s your hurry , sister ?
what &apos;s come over this here town ? Yankees have come over it !
same as they &apos;ve come over all of us .
out of our way , trash !
get out of the way here . get away ! go on !
surely it can &apos;t be Miss Scarlett !
- Why , Frank Kennedy ! - And Mammy !
it sure is good to see home folks . I didn &apos;t know you were in Atlanta . I didn &apos;t know you were .
didn &apos;t Miss Suellen tell you about my store ? did she ? I don &apos;t remember .
this ? won &apos;t you come in and look around a bit ?
I don &apos;t suppose it looks like much to a lady , but ...
I can &apos;t help being proud of it . you &apos;re not making money ?
well , I can &apos;t complain . in fact , I &apos;m mighty encouraged .
folks tell me I &apos;m just a born merchant .
it won &apos;t be long now before Miss Suellen and I can marry . are you doing as well as all that ?
Yes , I am , Miss Scarlett . I &apos;m no millionaire yet ... but I &apos;ve cleared $ 1,000 already .
well ... that &apos;s only a sideline .
a sideline , Frank ?
with all the good Georgia pine around Atlanta and all this building going on ?
well , all that takes money , Miss Scarlett ... and I &apos;ve got to be thinking about buying a home .
what do you want a home for ? for Miss Suellen and me to set up housekeeping .
here in Atlanta .
you &apos;d want to bring her to Atlanta , wouldn &apos;t you ?
there wouldn &apos;t be much help in that for Tara .
I don &apos;t rightly know what you mean , Miss Scarlett .
Frank , how &apos;d you like to drive me out to my Aunt Pitty &apos;s ?
nothing would give me more pleasure , Miss Scarlett .
you &apos;d better stay to supper , too .
I &apos;m sure Aunt Pitty &apos;d be agreeable and I &apos;d like a good long visit with you .
Oh , you act on me just like a tonic , Miss Scarlett .
and will you tell me all the news ... all the news of Miss Suellen ?
what &apos;s the matter , Miss Scarlett ?
Miss Suellen &apos;s not ill , is she ?
Oh , no , no . I thought surely she had written you .
I guess she was ashamed to write you .
she should be ashamed . Oh , how awful to have such a mean sister .
you must tell me , Miss Scarlett .
don &apos;t leave me on tenterhooks .
well , she &apos;s going to marry one of the county boys next month .
she just got tired of waiting and was afraid she &apos;d be an old maid ...
Oh , I &apos;m sorry to be the one to tell you . Oh , it &apos;s cold .
I left my muff at home .
would you mind if I put my hand in your pocket ?
but , Melanie , you don &apos;t realize what she &apos;s done .
she did it to save Tara , you must understand that . I hate Tara ! and I hate Scarlett !
it &apos;s all my fault .
I should have committed highway robbery to get that tax money for you .
I couldn &apos;t let you do anything like that , and ...
well , anyway , it &apos;s done now . Yes , it &apos;s done now .
you wouldn &apos;t let me do anything dishonorable ... but you &apos;d sell yourself in marriage to a man you didn &apos;t love .
well , at least you won &apos;t have to worry about my helplessness anymore .
what do you mean ?
I &apos;m going to New York . I &apos;ve arranged to get a position in a bank there .
but you can &apos;t do that .
I counted on you to help me start a lumber business , Ashley ... and , well , I counted on you .
I wouldn &apos;t be any good to you . I don &apos;t know anything about the lumber business .
you know as much as you do about banking . and I &apos;d give you half the business , Ashley .
I &apos;d bury forever any hope of standing alone . Oh , is that all ? well , you could gradually buy the business and then it would be your own , and ...
no , Scarlett .
Ashley ...
Ashley .
Scarlett !
Scarlett , what is it ? Ashley &apos;s so mean and hateful .
what have you done ? she wanted me to go to Atlanta .
to help me start my lumber business , and he won &apos;t lift a finger to help me , and he ...
why , how unchivalrous of you .
why , think , Ashley , think .
if it hadn &apos;t been for Scarlett , I &apos;d have died in Atlanta .
and maybe we wouldn &apos;t have had little Beau ... and when I think of her picking cotton and plowing just to keep food ... in our mouths , I could just ...
Oh , my darling .
all right , Melanie .
I &apos;ll go to Atlanta .
I can &apos;t fight you both .
well , here &apos;s your new mill hands , Mrs. Kennedy .
the pick of all the best jails in Georgia .
they look pretty thin and weak to me , Gallagher .
Halt !
they &apos;re the best you can lease , ma &apos;am .
and if you &apos;ll just give Johnny Gallagher a free hand ... you &apos;ll get what you want out of them .
all right , you &apos;re the foreman .
all I ask is , you keep the mill running and deliver my lumber when I want it .
Johnny Gallagher &apos;s your man , miss .
but remember ... no questions and no interference .
that &apos;s a bargain . start them in the morning , Gallagher .
come on , get a move on ! come on , move on there !
but , Scarlett , this isn &apos;t right and you know it .
it &apos;s bad enough for a woman to be in business , but ...
what are you complaining about ?
you wouldn &apos;t have owned a mill had I not taken over .
I didn &apos;t want the mill , and we couldn &apos;t have bought it ... if you hadn &apos;t pressed all of our friends for the money they owed me .
isn &apos;t that right , Ashley ?
what , are you running a charitable institution ? go back to the store , then go home and take your medicine .
you &apos;re not looking very well .
but , sugar , shouldn &apos;t you come home with me ? great balls of fire .
don &apos;t bother me anymore , and don &apos;t call me sugar ! all right , all right . good night , Ashley .
she can get mad quicker than any woman I ever saw .
Scarlett , I don &apos;t like to interfere , but ... I do wish you &apos;d let me hire free darkies instead of using convicts .
I believe we could do better . darkies !
why , their pay would break us , and convicts are dirt-cheap . if we just give Gallagher a free hand ...
a free hand ! you know what that means .
he &apos;ll starve them and whip them . some of them are sick , underfed ...
Oh , Ashley , how you do run on .
I will not make money out of the enforced labor and misery of others .
you weren &apos;t so particular about owning slaves .
that was different . we didn &apos;t treat them that way .
besides , I &apos;d have freed them all when father died ... if the war hadn &apos;t already freed them .
Oh , I &apos;m sorry , Ashley .
but have you forgotten what it &apos;s like without money ?
I found out that money is the most important thing in the world ... and I don &apos;t intend ever to be without it again .
I &apos;ll make enough so the Yankees can never take Tara away from me . I &apos;ll make it the only way I know how .
but we &apos;re not the only Southerners who have suffered .
look at all our friends .
they &apos;re keeping their honor and their kindness , too . and they &apos;re starving .
I &apos;ve got no use for fools who won &apos;t help themselves . I know what they &apos;re saying about me , and I don &apos;t care .
I &apos;ll make friends with Yankee carpetbaggers .
I &apos;ll beat them at their own game , and you &apos;ll beat them with me .
that &apos;s it . move it a little over to that side .
afternoon , Mrs. Kennedy .
good afternoon . business is certainly growing , ain &apos;t it ?
it certainly is .
but you &apos;re doing business with the same people who robbed us ... and tortured us and left us to starve .
all that &apos;s past , Melly . and I intend to make the best of things , even if they are Yankee things .
and do you know , Dolly Merriwether , that Dr. Meade actually saw her ... peddling lumber to those Yankees herself . and that isn &apos;t all ...
tell me , Scarlett , do you never shrink from marrying men you don &apos;t love ?
how did you ever get out of jail ? why didn &apos;t they hang you ? Oh , that !
I observe it &apos;s even bought you the honorable Mr. Wilkes . so you still hate Ashley Wilkes .
do you know , I believe you &apos;re jealous of him .
that you &apos;re the cutest little trick in shoe leather . every man you meet is dying of love for you . let me by !
haven &apos;t you been told it &apos;s dangerous to drive alone through all that riffraff ? don &apos;t worry about me . I can shoot straight if I don &apos;t have to shoot too far .
could you give me a quarter ? let go of my horse !
hold this horse !
help !
help ! help !
Miss Scarlett ! Miss Scarlett ! it &apos;s Big Sam !
big Sam ! Miss Scarlett ! wait !
Sam !
Sam ! is you hurt , Miss Scarlett ?
did they hurt you ?
don &apos;t you cry , Miss Scarlett .
big Sam &apos;ll get you out of this in a jiffy .
horse , make tracks !
you get to Tara just as quick as you can and stay there .
I sure will .
I got enough of them carpetbaggers . thank you , Mr. Frank .
Goodbye , Miss Scarlett . Goodbye , Sam , and thank you .
Scarlett , change your dress and go over to Miss Melly &apos;s for the evening .
I &apos;ve got to go to a political meeting .
a political meeting ! how can you go to a political meeting ... after what I &apos;ve been through this afternoon ?
nobody cares about me . you all act as though it was nothing at all .
the men talk , talk , talk about protecting our women ... and after what happened to me today Frank has to go to a political meeting .
and if it won &apos;t pain you too much , India Wilkes ...
I &apos;d be much obliged if you &apos;ll tell me why you &apos;re staring at me . has my face gone green or something ?
it won &apos;t pain me ! what happened this afternoon was just what you deserved !
if there was any justice , you &apos;d have gotten worse .
India , hush up ! let her talk . she &apos;s always hated me !
ever since I took your brother away from her ... though she &apos;s too much of a hypocrite to admit it !
if she thought anyone &apos;d go for her ... she &apos;d walk down the street naked !
I do hate you ! you &apos;ve done all you could to lower the prestige of decent people .
now you &apos;ve endangered the lives of our men , because they ...
India !
I don &apos;t think we &apos;d better say any more , or one of us will be saying too much .
what &apos;s going on around here that I don &apos;t know about ?
somebody &apos;s coming up the walk . somebody that ain &apos;t Mr. Ashley .
will you hand me the pistol , please , Mrs. Meade ?
whoever it is ... we know nothing .
where have they gone ? you &apos;ve got to tell me , Mrs. Wilkes .
I was playing poker with two Yankee captains . they knew there &apos;d be trouble . they &apos;ve sent their cavalry out .
your husband and his friends are walking into a trap .
don &apos;t tell him !
he &apos;s trying to trap you !
at the Decatur Road .
the old Sullivan plantation .
the house is burned . they &apos;re meeting in the cellar .
I &apos;ll do what I can .
what &apos;s all this about ?
if you don &apos;t tell me , I &apos;ll go crazy ! we thought it best not to tell you .
Ashley , Frank and the others have gone to clean out those woods ... where you were attacked .
a great many Southern gentlemen have ... done this lately for our protection .
and if they &apos;re captured , they &apos;ll be hanged , Scarlett ! and it will be your fault ! another word , and you go out of this house , India !
Scarlett did what she thought she had to do .
and our men are doing what they think they have to do . Frank !
Oh , it isn &apos;t possible !
there &apos;s horses , Miss Melly . here they come . you &apos;re sewing , you &apos;re sewing .
open the door , Mammy .
good evening , Mrs. Kennedy .
which of you ladies is Mrs. Wilkes ? I am Mrs. Wilkes .
I should like to speak to Mr. Wilkes , if you please .
he &apos;s not here . are you sure ?
don &apos;t you doubt Miss Melly &apos;s word .
I meant no disrespect , Mrs. Wilkes . if you &apos;ll give me your word , I won &apos;t search the house .
search if you like , but Mr. Wilkes is at a political meeting at Mr. Kennedy &apos;s store .
he &apos;s not at the store , and there &apos;s no meeting tonight ! no political meeting .
we &apos;ll wait outside till he and his friends return .
sergeant , surround the house . put a man on each door and window .
Yes , sir !
keep on with your sewing , ladies .
and I &apos;ll read aloud .
&quot; the Personal History and Experience of David Copperfield .
&quot; chapter one .
&quot; I am born .
&quot; to begin my life with the beginning of my life , I record that I was born .
&quot; chapter Nine . I have a memorable birthday .
&quot; I pass over all that happened at school ...
&quot; until the anniversary of my birthday came around in March .
&quot; except that Steerforth was more to be admired than ever ...
&quot; I remember nothing .
&quot; he was going away at the end of the half-year , if not sooner ...
&quot; and was more spirited and independent than before in my eyes ...
&quot; and therefore more engaging than before ; but ...
&quot; I remember nothing . &quot;
Melly ! they &apos;re drunk !
leave this to me , Scarlett .
and please , say nothing .
you stupid fool !
quiet !
will you shut up for the love of ...
Hello , Melly .
so you &apos;ve got my husband intoxicated again , Capt. Butler ! well , bring him in .
I &apos;m sorry , Mrs. Wilkes . your husband &apos;s under arrest .
if you arrest all the men who get intoxicated ... you must have a good many Yankees in jail .
bring him in , Capt. Butler . if you can walk yourself .
I want to tell you a story ...
listen , Doctor , I ... Put him there in that chair .
and now , Capt. Butler , will you please leave my house ... and try to remember not to come here again ?
well , now , that &apos;s fine thanks I get for bringing him home ... and not leaving him on the streets in this shameful condition !
now , boys , all together ! Dr. Meade ...
I &apos;m astonished at you !
Oh , Ashley ! how can you do this to me ?
I ain &apos;t so very drunk , Melly .
take him into the bedroom and lay him out on the bed as usual .
don &apos;t touch him , he &apos;s under arrest !
now , Tom .
what do you want to arrest him for ? I &apos;ve seen him drunker .
I &apos;ve seen you drunker ! and you &apos;ve seen me ...
he can lie in the gutter for all I care ! I &apos;m not a policeman .
but he led a raid tonight on that shantytown ... where Mrs. Kennedy got into trouble this afternoon . a lot of those shanties were burned .
a couple of men were killed .
it &apos;s about time you rebels learned you can &apos;t take the law into your own hands . what are you laughing at ?
this isn &apos;t your night to teach that lesson , Tom .
these two have been with me tonight . Yes , sir . with you , Rhett ?
where ?
I don &apos;t like to say in the presence of ladies .
you &apos;d better say . come out on the porch and I &apos;ll tell you .
I think I have a right to know where my husband &apos;s been .
well , ma &apos;am , we dropped in on a friend of mine ... and the Captain &apos;s .
a Mrs. Belle Watling .
we played cards , drank champagne and ... well ...
now you &apos;ve done it !
did you have to show me up in front of my wife ?
now I hope you &apos;re satisfied , Tom .
these ladies won &apos;t be on speaking terms with their husbands tomorrow .
Rhett , I had no idea , I ...
look here , will you take an oath that they were with you tonight at ... at Belle &apos;s ?
ask Belle , if you don &apos;t believe me . she &apos;ll tell you , Captain .
will you give me your word as a gentleman ?
as a gentleman ? why , certainly , Tom .
well , if I ... if I &apos;ve made a mistake , I &apos;m sorry .
I hope you &apos;ll forgive me , Mrs. Wilkes .
if you &apos;ll go and leave us in peace , please .
well , I say I &apos;m sorry , and ... well , I am sorry .
come on , Sergeant .
lock that door .
pull down the shades . Ashley . he &apos;s all right .
it &apos;s only in the shoulder . get him on the bed where I can dress the wound . I think I can walk .
in here . - Mammy , I want some hot water . - Yes , sir .
now what can I use for a probe ? if I only had my bag . were you really there ?
does she have cut-glass chandeliers , plush curtains and dozens of mirrors ?
good heavens , Mrs. Meade , remember yourself .
now , Capt. Butler , tell me what happened , all that happened .
I was too late . when I got to the old Sullivan place ... there &apos;d already been a skirmish with the Yankees .
I found Mr. Wilkes wounded and Dr. Meade was with him .
I had to prove they had been somewhere , anyplace but where they were .
so I took them to Belle &apos;s .
and she took them in ?
she &apos;s by way of being an old friend of mine . Oh , I &apos;m sorry . I ...
this isn &apos;t the first time you &apos;ve come between me and disaster , Capt. Butler .
it isn &apos;t likely that I &apos;d question any device of yours .
and now I &apos;ll go and see what Dr. Meade needs .
Oh , Ashley !
Ashley !
have you no interest in what &apos;s become of your own husband , Mrs. Kennedy ?
did Frank go with you to Belle Watling &apos;s ?
no . well , where is he ?
he &apos;s lying out on Decatur Road ... shot through the head .
he &apos;s dead .
who is it ?
it &apos;s Miss Watling . Oh , Miss Watling !
won &apos;t you come in the house ? Oh , no , I couldn &apos;t do that , Miss Wilkes .
you come in and sit a minute with me .
how can I thank you enough for what you did for us ?
how can any of us thank you enough ? I got your note saying you was going to call on me and thank me .
why , Miss Wilkes , you must have lost your mind .
I come up here as soon as it was dark to tell you ... you mustn &apos;t even think of any such thing . why , I &apos;m ... Why , you &apos;re ...
well , it wouldn &apos;t be fitting at all . it wouldn &apos;t be fitting to thank a kind woman who saved my husband &apos;s life ?
Miss Wilkes , there ain &apos;t never been a lady in this town nice to me like you was .
I mean , about the money for the hospital , you know . and I don &apos;t forget a kindness .
and I got to thinking about you being left a widow with a little boy ... if Mr. Wilkes got hung ... and he &apos;s a nice little boy , your boy is , Miss Wilkes .
I got a boy myself and so I ...
Oh , you have ?
does he live ... Oh , no , ma &apos;am , he ain &apos;t here in Atlanta . he ain &apos;t never been here .
he &apos;s off at school . I ain &apos;t seen him since he was little .
well , anyway , if it had been that Miss Kennedy &apos;s husband by himself ...
I should be proud to speak to you .
proud to be under obligation to you .
and you &apos;re wrong about Mrs. Kennedy .
great balls of fire !
it &apos;s Rhett .
Miss Scarlett , Capt. Butler here to see you .
I told him you was prostrate with grief . tell him I &apos;ll be right down , Mammy .
she says she &apos;s coming .
I don &apos;t know why she &apos;s coming . but she &apos;s a-coming . you don &apos;t like me , Mammy .
now don &apos;t you argue with me . you don &apos;t . you really don &apos;t .
it &apos;s no good , Scarlett .
what ? the cologne . I &apos;m sure I don &apos;t know what you mean .
I mean you &apos;ve been drinking . brandy . quite a lot .
is that any of your affair ?
don &apos;t drink alone , Scarlett .
people always find out and it ruins the reputation .
what is it ?
this is more than losing old Frank .
Oh , Rhett ... I &apos;m so afraid . I don &apos;t believe it .
you &apos;ve never been afraid in your life . I &apos;m afraid now . I &apos;m afraid of dying and going to hell .
you look pretty healthy , and maybe there isn &apos;t any hell .
well , far be it from me to question the teachings of childhood .
tell me what you &apos;ve done that hell yawns before you .
I ought never to have married Frank to begin with .
he was Suellen &apos;s beau and he loved her , not me .
and I made him miserable . and I killed him .
Yes , I did . I killed him .
for the first time I &apos;m finding out what it is to be sorry for something I &apos;ve done .
here . dry your eyes .
if you had it all to do over again , you &apos;d do no differently .
you &apos;re like the thief who isn &apos;t the least bit sorry he stole ... but he &apos;s terribly , terribly sorry he &apos;s going to jail .
I &apos;m glad Mother &apos;s dead .
I &apos;m glad she &apos;s dead so she can &apos;t see me .
I always wanted to be like her , calm and kind and ...
and I certainly have turned out disappointing .
you know , Scarlett , I think you &apos;re on the verge of a crying jag .
so I &apos;ll change the subject and say what I came to say .
say it , then , and get out ! what is it ?
that I can &apos;t go on any longer without you .
you are the most ill-bred man to come here at a time like this with your filthy ...
I made up my mind that you were the only woman for me ... the first day I saw you at Twelve Oaks .
now that you &apos;ve got the lumber mill and Frank &apos;s money ... you won &apos;t come to me as you did to the jail .
so I see I shall have to marry you .
I never heard of such bad taste .
would you be more convinced if I fell to my knees ?
turn me loose , you varmint , and get out of here !
forgive me for startling you with the impetuosity of my sentiments ... my dear Scarlett .
I mean , my dear Mrs. Kennedy .
but it cannot have escaped your notice that for some time past ... the friendship I have felt for you has ripened into a deeper feeling .
a feeling more beautiful , more pure , more sacred .
I don &apos;t like your common jokes .
this is an honorable proposal of marriage ... made at what I consider a most opportune moment .
I can &apos;t go all my life waiting to catch you between husbands .
you &apos;re coarse , and you &apos;re conceited .
besides , I shall never marry again . Oh , yes , you will , and you &apos;ll marry me .
you ? you ?
I don &apos;t love you !
and I don &apos;t like being married .
did you ever think of marrying just for fun ?
marriage , fun ? fiddle-dee-dee . fun for men , you mean .
hush up ! do you want them to hear you ?
you &apos;ve been married to a boy and an old man .
why not try a husband of the right age , with a way with women ?
you &apos;re a fool , Rhett Butler , when you know I shall always love another man .
stop it !
do you hear me , Scarlett ? stop it ! no more of that talk .
Rhett , don &apos;t , I shall faint .
I want you to faint . this is what you were meant for .
none of the fools you &apos;ve known have kissed you like this , have they ?
your Charles , or your Frank , or your stupid Ashley .
say you &apos;re going to marry me .
say &quot; yes . &quot; say &quot; yes . &quot; Yes . are you sure you meant it ?
you don &apos;t want to take it back ?
no .
look at me and try to tell me the truth .
did you say &quot; yes &quot; because of my money ? well ... Yes .
fond of me ?
if I said I was madly in love with you , you &apos;d know I was lying ... but you always said we had a lot in common ...
Yes , you &apos;re right , my dear .
I &apos;m not in love with you any more than you are with me .
heaven help the man who ever really loves you . what kind of a ring would you like , my darling ?
a diamond ring . and do buy a great big one , Rhett . you shall have the biggest and the most vulgar ring in Atlanta .
still the little hypocrite . aren &apos;t you going to kiss me goodbye ?
don &apos;t you think you &apos;ve had enough kissing for one afternoon ? you &apos;re impossible .
you can go and I don &apos;t care if you never come back . but I will come back .
what are you thinking about , Scarlett ? I &apos;m thinking about how rich we are .
Rhett , I can keep the lumber business too , can &apos;t I ?
Yes , of course you can , if it amuses you .
now that you &apos;re rich you can tell everyone to go to the devil ... as you &apos;ve always said you wanted to .
but you were the main one I wanted to go to the devil .
don &apos;t scrape the plate , Scarlett . I &apos;m sure there &apos;s more in the kitchen .
Rhett , can I have one of those chocolate ones stuffed with meringue ?
if you don &apos;t stop being such a glutton , you &apos;ll get as fat as Mammy .
then I &apos;ll divorce you . wouldn &apos;t it be nice if you bought something for Mammy , too ?
why should I buy her a present when she called us both mules ?
mules ?
why mules ?
Yes , she said we could give ourselves airs , and get ourselves all slicked up ... like racehorses but we were just mules in horse harness ... and we didn &apos;t fool anybody .
I never heard anything more true . Mammy &apos;s a smart old soul ... and one of the few people I know whose respect I &apos;d like to have .
I won &apos;t give her a thing . she doesn &apos;t deserve it .
then I &apos;ll take her a petticoat .
my Mammy always said when she went to heaven ... she wanted a red taffeta petticoat , so stiff that it would stand by itself ... and so rustly , the Lord would think it was made of angels &apos; wings .
well , she won &apos;t take it from you . she &apos;d rather die than wear it .
that may be , but I &apos;m making the gesture just the same .
wake up ! wake up !
you were having another nightmare .
Oh , Rhett .
I couldn &apos;t find it .
I ran through the mist and I couldn &apos;t find it .
- Find what , honey ? - I don &apos;t know .
I always dream the same dream and I never know .
it seems to be hidden in the mist .
darling .
Rhett , do you think I &apos;ll ever dream that I &apos;ve found it and that I &apos;m safe ?
dreams don &apos;t work that way , but when you get used to being safe and warm ... you &apos;ll stop dreaming that dream .
and , Scarlett , I &apos;m going to see that you are safe .
would you do something for me if I asked you ?
you know I would .
will you take me away from here ? don &apos;t you like New Orleans ?
I love New Orleans , but I want to go home and visit Tara .
will you take me to Tara ?
Yes , Scarlett , of course I will . we &apos;ll go tomorrow .
you get your strength from this red earth of Tara , Scarlett .
you &apos;re part of it , and it &apos;s part of you . Rhett , I &apos;d give anything to have Tara the way it was before the war .
would you ?
then go ahead and make it that way .
spend whatever you want , make it as fine a plantation as it ever was . Oh , Rhett .
Rhett , you are good to me .
and can we still have our big new house in Atlanta ?
Yes , and it can be as ornate as you want :
marble terraces , stained-glass windows and all .
Rhett , won &apos;t everyone be jealous ?
I want everybody who &apos;s been mean to me to be pea-green with envy .
Scarlett &apos;s hateful , building that new house just to show off ... and even taking our servants .
Oh , darling , you mustn &apos;t think unkindly of her .
she &apos;s made it possible for us to keep Tara always .
Yes , and what good is Tara ?
she &apos;s had three husbands and I &apos;ll be an old maid .
great Jehoshaphat !
great Jehoshaphat !
I &apos;m entitled to at least see what my own child looks like .
you control yourself , Mr. Rhett .
you &apos;ll be seeing it for a long time .
I &apos;d like to apologize , Mr. Rhett , about it &apos;s not being a boy . Oh , hush your mouth , Mammy .
who wants a boy ? boys aren &apos;t any use to anybody .
don &apos;t you think I &apos;m proof of that ?
have a drink of sherry , Mammy .
Mammy , she is beautiful , isn &apos;t she ?
she sure is . did you ever see a prettier one ?
well , sir , Miss Scarlett was mighty nigh that pretty when she come , but not quite .
have another glass , Mammy .
what &apos;s that rustling noise I hear ?
Lordsy , Mr. Rhett .
that ain &apos;t nothing but my red silk petticoat you done give me .
nothing but your petticoat ?
I don &apos;t believe it . let me see .
pull up your skirt . Mr. Rhett , you is bad .
Yeah , oh , Lord !
you sure took a long enough time about wearing it .
Yes , sir , too long . no more mule in horse &apos;s harness ?
Mr. Rhett , Miss Scarlett was bad telling you about that .
you ain &apos;t holding that against old Mammy , is you ?
no , I ain &apos;t holding it against you . I just wanted to know . have another glass , Mammy .
here , take the whole bottle . Dr. Meade says you may go in now , Capt. Butler .
this sure is a happy day to me .
I done diapered three generations of this family &apos;s girls ... and it sure is a happy day .
Oh , yes , Mammy .
the happiest days are when babies come . I wish ...
Oh , Mammy , she &apos;s beautiful .
what do you suppose they &apos;ll name her ?
Miss Scarlett done told me if it was a girl ... she &apos;s going to name it Eugenie Victoria .
Yes ... she &apos;s a beautiful baby ... the most beautiful baby ever .
Yes .
do you know that this is your birthday ?
that you &apos;re a week old today ?
Yes , I &apos;m going to buy her a pony the likes of which this town has never seen .
and her &apos;ll be received by the best families in the South . and when it comes time for her to marry ... well , she &apos;ll be a little princess .
you certainly are making a fool of yourself . and why shouldn &apos;t I ?
she &apos;s the first person who &apos;s ever completely belonged to me .
great balls of fire !
I had the baby , didn &apos;t I ?
it &apos;s Melanie .
may I come in ? come in , Melly .
Yes , come in and look at my daughter &apos;s beautiful blue eyes .
but , Capt. Butler , most babies have blue eyes when they &apos;re born .
don &apos;t try to tell him anything .
he knows everything about babies . nevertheless , her eyes are blue and they &apos;re going to stay blue .
as blue as the Bonnie Blue Flag .
that &apos;s it . that &apos;s what we &apos;ll call her . Bonnie Blue Butler .
Twenty inches .
Twenty inches ! I &apos;ve grown as big as Aunt Pitty . you &apos;ve simply got to make it 18.5 again , Mammy .
never .
and there ain &apos;t nothing to do about it . there is something to do about it !
I &apos;m just not going to get old and fat before my time .
I heard Mr. Rhett say that he &apos;ll be wanting a son next year .
go tell Capt. Butler I &apos;ve decided not to go out after all . I &apos;ll have supper in my room .
I got your message . I &apos;ll have them bring my supper up here , too .
no objections to that , I hope ?
no .
Yes .
I mean , I don &apos;t care where you have your supper .
Rhett ?
Yes ?
you see ... well , I &apos;ve decided ... well , I hope I don &apos;t have any more children .
my pet , as I told you before Bonnie was born ... it &apos;s immaterial to me whether you have one child or 20 !
no , but you know what I ... Do you know what I mean ? I do .
and do you know I can divorce you for this ?
you &apos;re just low enough to think of something like that !
if you had any chivalry in you or would be nice , like ...
well , Ashley Wilkes !
Melanie can &apos;t have any more children and he ...
you &apos;ve been to the lumber office this afternoon , haven &apos;t you ?
what has that got to do with it ?
quite the little gentleman , Ashley .
pray go on , Mrs. Butler . it &apos;s no use . you wouldn &apos;t understand .
you &apos;d never know him , never even understand his mind ... any more than you understand anything except money .
never mind about that ! what I want to know is ...
you may keep your sanctity , Scarlett .
it &apos;ll work no hardship on me .
do you mean to say you don &apos;t care ?
the world is full of many things and many people , and I shan &apos;t be lonely .
I &apos;ll find comfort elsewhere . well , that &apos;s fine .
just in case you change your mind , I intend to lock my door . why bother ? if I wanted to come in , no lock could keep me out !
I always knew that most women were cheats , hypocritical and hard .
you gotta think of the child .
the child &apos;s worth ten of the mother .
you &apos;re a shrewd woman , Belle , and a very nice one .
Yes , Rhett ?
I was just thinking of the difference between you and ...
you &apos;re both hardheaded businesswomen and you &apos;re both successful .
but you &apos;ve got a heart , Belle ... and you &apos;re honest .
Goodbye , Rhett .
Goodbye , Belle .
she &apos;ll be a wonderful horsewoman !
why do we have to wheel a baby when there are servants ... Good morning , Mrs. Merriwether .
good morning , Capt. Butler . good morning , Scarlett .
making fools of ourselves in front of these old buffaloes !
if you &apos;d thought of your position years ago , you wouldn &apos;t have to do this .
but as it is , we &apos;ll cultivate every female dragon of the old guard in this town .
good morning , Mrs. Whiting .
good morning , Capt. Butler .
good morning , Scarlett .
so the millionaire speculator is turning respectable !
all of our money can &apos;t buy what I want for Bonnie . Oh , I &apos;ll admit I &apos;ve been at fault , too .
but Bonnie &apos;s going to have her place among decent people . Yes , even if we both have to crawl on our bellies to every fat old cat .
good morning , Mrs. Meade .
good morning , Capt. Butler .
good morning , Scarlett .
Mrs. Merriwether , I &apos;ve always had a great regard for your knowledge .
I wonder if you could give me some advice . certainly .
my Bonnie sucks her thumb . I can &apos;t make her stop it . make her stop it .
it &apos;ll ruin the shape of her mouth . I know , I know . she has such a beautiful mouth , too .
I tried putting soap under her nails .
soap ! bah ! put quinine on her thumb and she &apos;ll stop sucking it quick enough .
quinine ! I never would have thought of it . I can &apos;t thank you enough , Mrs. Merriwether .
you &apos;ve taken a great load off my mind !
good morning .
good morning , Caroline . I was just thinking . there must be a great deal of good in a man who could love a child so much .
but of course there is !
Oh , did I tell you that Fanny Elsing told Dr. Meade that Capt. Butler ... finally admitted he was honored by the Confederate Congress ... for his services at the Battle of Franklin ?
no !
and did I tell you , Caroline , that Capt. Butler ... made a stupendous contribution to the Association for the Beautification ... of the Graves of the Glorious Dead ?
no .
my little grandbaby , Napoleon Picard , is giving a party for Bonnie next week .
why , Dolly Merriwether , you know right well it was my idea ... to give a party for Bonnie Butler .
why Caroline Meade ...
now watch Daddy put your pony over , Bonnie .
now watch .
Daddy , let me ! let me !
all right , darling .
put her on , Pork !
up we go .
Oh , there ! Lordsy mercy ! there he goes again !
sit close . lean forward . be sure you go with him .
give your daddy a kiss . Mr. Rhett ! Mr. Rhett !
Mr. Rhett !
did you see her , Mammy ? wasn &apos;t she wonderful ?
Mr. Rhett , I done told you and told you it just ain &apos;t fitting ... for a girl child to ride astraddle with her dress flying up !
all right , Mammy . I &apos;ll teach her to ride sidesaddle . and I &apos;ll buy her a blue velvet riding habit .
she &apos;ll love that . a nice black broadcloth is what little girls wear .
now , Mammy , be reasonable .
well , I don &apos;t think it &apos;s fitting , but ...
it ain &apos;t fitting , it just ain &apos;t fitting .
it ain &apos;t fitting .
why , Scarlett ! what are you doing downtown at this time of day ?
Ashley , I just ...
why aren &apos;t you helping Melly get ready for my surprise birthday party ?
why , Ashley Wilkes , you aren &apos;t supposed to know anything about that .
Melly &apos;d be so disappointed if you weren &apos;t surprised . I won &apos;t let on .
I &apos;ll be the most surprised man in Atlanta .
as long as you &apos;re here , let me show you the books ... so you can see just how bad a businessman I really am .
Oh , don &apos;t let &apos;s fool with any books today . when I &apos;m wearing a new bonnet , all the figures I ever knew ... go right slap out of my head .
the figures are well lost when the bonnet &apos;s as pretty as that one .
Scarlett , you know , you get prettier all the time .
you haven &apos;t changed a bit since the day of our last barbecue at Twelve Oaks ... where you sat under a tree surrounded by dozens of beaux .
that girl doesn &apos;t exist anymore .
nothing &apos;s turned out as I expected , Ashley . nothing .
don &apos;t look back , Ashley .
don &apos;t look back .
it drags at your heart till you can &apos;t do anything but look back .
I didn &apos;t mean to make you sad , my dear .
I never want you to be anything but completely happy .
Oh , Ashley !
who is it ?
only your husband .
come in .
am I actually being invited into the sanctuary ?
you &apos;re not ready for Melanie &apos;s party . I &apos;ve got a headache , Rhett .
every woman and man in town knows the story !
you should kill them , spreading lies .
I have a strange way of not killing people who tell the truth . there &apos;s no time to argue . get up !
wear that ! nothing modest or matronly will do for this occasion .
for he &apos;s a jolly good fellow
- Good night , Scarlett .
- But Rhett , you can &apos;t ... You go into the arena alone . the lions are hungry for you .
you &apos;re not afraid ? which nobody can deny Which nobody can deny
for he &apos;s a jolly good fellow For he &apos;s a jolly good fellow
for he &apos;s a jolly good fellow Which nobody can deny
what a lovely dress , Scarlett , darling .
India wasn &apos;t able to come tonight .
will you be an angel ?
I do need you to help me receive my guests .
did you have a good time tonight at Miss Melly &apos;s party , child ? Yes , yes . now , Mammy , be sure and leave word .
come in , Mrs. Butler .
come here .
sit down !
there &apos;s no reason why you shouldn &apos;t have your nightcap even if I am here . I didn &apos;t want a drink .
you wouldn &apos;t have come down if you &apos;d thought I was here .
- You must need a drink badly . - I do not ! take it .
I know you drink on the quiet , and I know how much you drink .
do you think I care if you like your brandy ?
you &apos;re drunk , and I &apos;m going to bed !
I &apos;m very drunk ... and I intend getting still drunker before the evening &apos;s over ... but you &apos;re not going to bed , not yet .
sit down .
so she stood by you , did she ?
how does it feel to have the woman you &apos;ve wronged cloak your sins for you ?
you &apos;re wondering if she knows all about you and Ashley .
you &apos;re wondering if she did it just to save her face . you &apos;re thinking that she &apos;s a fool for doing it even if it did save your hide .
- I will not listen . - Yes , you &apos;ll listen !
Miss Melly &apos;s a fool , but not the kind you think .
it &apos;s just that there &apos;s too much honor in her to ever conceive of dishonor ... in anyone she loves .
though just why she does , I &apos;m sure I don &apos;t know !
if you weren &apos;t so drunk and insulting , I could explain everything .
- As it is , though ... - If you get out of that chair once more ...
of course , the comic figure in all this is the long-suffering Mr. Wilkes .
Mr. Wilkes , who can &apos;t be mentally faithful to his wife ... and won &apos;t be unfaithful to her technically .
why doesn &apos;t he make up his mind ?
Rhett , you ...
observe my hands , my dear .
and I &apos;d do it , if it &apos;d take Ashley out of your mind forever .
but it wouldn &apos;t .
so I &apos;ll remove him from your mind forever this way .
I &apos;ll put my hands so ... one on each side of your head ... and I &apos;ll smash your skull between them like a walnut .
that &apos;ll block him out .
take your hands off me , you drunken fool .
you know I &apos;ve always admired your spirit , my dear .
never more than now , when you &apos;re cornered .
I &apos;m not cornered .
you &apos;ll never corner me , Rhett Butler , or frighten me !
jealous , am I ? Yes , I suppose I am .
even though I know you &apos;ve been faithful to me all along . how do I know ?
because I know Ashley Wilkes and his honorable breed . they &apos;re gentlemen .
you turned me out while you chased Ashley Wilkes ... while you dreamed of Ashley Wilkes .
this is one night you &apos;re not turning me out .
Oh , she wept with delight when he gave her a smile
and trembled with fear at his frown
Hello .
I &apos;d like to extend my apology for my conduct of last night .
Oh , but Rhett ...
I was very drunk ... and quite swept off my feet by your charms .
well , you needn &apos;t bother to apologize . nothing you ever do surprises me !
I &apos;ve been thinking things over , and I really believe that ... it would be better for both of us ... if we admitted we &apos;d made a mistake and got a divorce .
- A divorce ?
- Yes . there &apos;s no point in our holding on to each other , is there ? I &apos;ll provide for you amply .
you &apos;ve plenty of grounds . just give me Bonnie .
say what you please . I won &apos;t contest .
thank you very much . but I wouldn &apos;t dream of disgracing my family with a divorce .
you &apos;d disgrace it quick enough if Ashley were free .
it makes my head spin to think how quickly you &apos;d divorce me .
wouldn &apos;t you , Scarlett ?
well , answer me . wouldn &apos;t you ?
will you please go now and leave me alone ? Yes , I &apos;m going .
that &apos;s what I came to tell you .
I &apos;m going on a very extended trip to London , and I &apos;m leaving today .
and I &apos;m taking Bonnie with me .
so you &apos;ll please get her little duds packed right away . you &apos;ll never take my child out of this house .
I wouldn &apos;t leave her here ... with a mother who hasn &apos;t the decency to consider her own reputation .
you &apos;re a fine one to talk .
you think I &apos;ll let her out of this house ... when you &apos;ll probably have her around with people like that Belle ?
if you were a man I &apos;d break your neck for that .
as it is , I &apos;ll thank you to shut your stupid mouth .
as for you , giving yourself pious airs about your motherhood ... Why , a cat &apos;s a better mother than you are .
have her things packed and ready for me in an hour , or I warn you ...
I &apos;ve always thought a good lashing with a buggy whip would benefit you immensely .
excuse me , Mr. Rhett .
Hello , Uncle Rhett . Hello , hello , Beau .
Daddy , Daddy . where have you been ? I &apos;ve been waiting for you all morning .
well , I &apos;ve been hunting for a rabbit skin to wrap my little Bonnie in . give your best sweetheart a kiss .
I &apos;m going to take you on a long trip to fairyland .
where ? where ?
I &apos;m going to show you the Tower of London , where the little princes were ... and London Bridge .
London Bridge ! will it be falling down ?
well , it will if you want it to , darling .
Daddy , dark !
Yes , yes . what &apos;s the matter with my Bonnie ? a bear .
Oh , a bear ? a big bear ?
dreadful big . and he sat on my chest .
well , I &apos;ll stay here and shoot him if he comes back .
good evening , Mr. Butler .
either you &apos;re a fool or the most inhuman woman I &apos;ve ever seen ! of course , if you want her to grow up nervous and cowardly .
there isn &apos;t a cowardly bone in her body . you &apos;re discharged ! as you say , sir .
where is Mother ?
aren &apos;t you happy here in London with me ?
I want to go home .
Miss Bonnie .
and Capt. Butler . - Miss Scarlett . - Hello , Mammy .
Bonnie . Bonnie .
Bonnie , baby . darling baby .
are you glad to be home ?
Daddy gave me a kitten . - What a lovely kitten .
- London &apos;s a horrid place . - Oh , my darling .
- Where &apos;s my pony ?
- I want to go out and see my pony . - You go out and see your pony .
where &apos;s my pony ?
I wanna go out and see my pony . you run along with Mammy .
- Come on , honey child . - Go with Mammy . Mammy sure has missed you , honey .
Mrs. Butler , I believe .
Mammy said you &apos;d come back .
but only to bring Bonnie .
apparently any mother , even a bad one , is better for a child than none . you mean you &apos;re going away again ?
what perception , Mrs. Butler . right away . in fact , I left my bags at the station .
you &apos;re looking pale .
is there a shortage of rouge ?
or can this wanness mean you &apos;ve been missing me ? if I &apos;m pale , it &apos;s your fault .
not because I &apos;ve been missing you , but because ...
pray continue , Mrs. Butler . it &apos;s because I &apos;m going to have a baby .
I don &apos;t want it any more than you do . no woman would want the child of a cad like you . I wish it were anybody &apos;s child but yours .
well , cheer up . maybe you &apos;ll have an accident .
is she better ?
it &apos;s no use .
Dr. Meade &apos;s left . Scarlett &apos;s dead !
Oh , no , she &apos;s much better .
really , she is .
there , there , Capt. Butler .
you &apos;re beside yourself .
she &apos;ll very soon be well again , I promise you . no , you don &apos;t understand .
she never wanted this baby .
not want a baby ? why , every woman wants a baby ! Yes , you want children , but she doesn &apos;t .
not my children .
she told me she didn &apos;t want any more children ... and I wanted to hurt her because she &apos;d hurt me .
I wanted to and I did . hush . you mustn &apos;t tell me these things .
it &apos;s not fit .
I didn &apos;t know about this baby until the other day when she fell .
if I &apos;d known , I &apos;d have come home whether she wanted me or not !
well , of course you would . and then when she told me , there on the steps , what did I do ?
what did I say ?
I laughed and I said ...
but you didn &apos;t mean it . I know you didn &apos;t mean it . Oh , but I did mean it .
she &apos;s never cared for me .
I thought I could make her care , but I couldn &apos;t .
you &apos;re so wrong . Scarlett loves you a great deal , much more than she knows .
if that were only true I could wait forever .
if she &apos;d only forgive me , forget this ever happened . she will .
you must be patient . Oh , no , it &apos;s not possible .
if you only knew who she really loved ... you wouldn &apos;t believe it .
surely you haven &apos;t listened to idle gossip . no , Capt. Butler , I wouldn &apos;t believe it .
there , there .
Scarlett &apos;s going to get well and there can be other babies .
no , she couldn &apos;t even if she wanted to , after what she &apos;s been through . but of course she could .
I &apos;m going to .
no , Miss Melly , you mustn &apos;t risk it . it &apos;s too dangerous .
children are life-renewing itself , Capt. Butler ... and when life does that , danger seems very unimportant .
I &apos;ve never before known anyone who was really brave . I pray God things go well with you , Miss Melly .
from my heart , I thank you .
Miss Scarlett &apos;s feeling a heap better today , Mr. Rhett .
thank you , Mammy .
I &apos;ve come to ask your forgiveness ... in the hope that we can give our life together another chance .
our life together ?
when did we ever have a life together ?
Yes , you &apos;re right .
but I &apos;m sure if we could only try again , we could be happy .
what is there to make us happy now ?
well , there &apos;s Bonnie and ... and I love you , Scarlett .
when did you discover that ?
I &apos;ve always loved you , but you &apos;ve never given me a chance to show it .
well , and just what do you want me to do ?
to begin with , give up the mill , Scarlett . we &apos;ll go away .
we &apos;ll take Bonnie and have another honeymoon . give up the mill ? why ?
Yes , I know , but we don &apos;t need it .
sell it , or better still , give it to Ashley .
Melanie &apos;s been such a friend to both of us .
always Melanie !
if you &apos;d think a little more about me ...
I am thinking of you ... and I &apos;m thinking that ... well , maybe it &apos;s the mill that &apos;s taking you away from me ... and from Bonnie .
I know what you &apos;re thinking .
don &apos;t try to bring Bonnie into this .
you &apos;re the one taking her away from me . but she loves you .
you &apos;ve done everything to make her love you , not me .
she &apos;s so spoiled now that ... Mommy ! Daddy !
we &apos;re watching , darling .
you &apos;re mighty pretty , precious .
so are you .
I &apos;m going to jump . watch me , Daddy .
I don &apos;t think you ought to do much jumping yet , Bonnie .
remember , you &apos;ve just learned to ride sidesaddle . I will so jump !
I can jump better than ever &apos; cause I &apos;ve grown ... and I &apos;ve moved the bar higher . don &apos;t let her do it , Rhett .
no , Bonnie , you can &apos;t .
well , if you fall off , don &apos;t cry and blame me . Rhett , stop her !
Bonnie ! Bonnie !
Lordsy , Miss Melly .
this house won &apos;t seem the same without Bonnie .
how &apos;s Miss Scarlett bearing up ?
Miss Melly , this here done broke her heart ... but I didn &apos;t fetch you here on Miss Scarlett &apos;s account .
what that child got to stand , the good Lord give her strength to stand .
it &apos;s Mr. Rhett I &apos;s worried about .
he done lost his mind these last couple of days .
no , Mammy , no .
I ain &apos;t never see &apos;d no man , black or white , set such store on any child .
when Dr. Meade say her neck broke ...
Mr. Rhett grab his gun and run out there and shoot that poor pony ... and for a minute I think he going to shoot hisself .
Oh , poor Capt. Butler . Yes , ma &apos;am . Miss Scarlett , she call him a murderer for teaching that child to jump .
she say , &quot; You give me my baby what you kill . &quot;
and then he say Miss Scarlett ain &apos;t never cared nothing about Miss Bonnie .
it like to turn my blood cold , the things they say to one another .
stop , Mammy , don &apos;t tell me any more .
and then that night ...
Mr. Rhett , he locked hisself in the nursery with Miss Bonnie ... and he wouldn &apos;t even open the door ... when Miss Scarlett beat on it and hollered to him .
and that &apos;s the way it &apos;s been for two whole days .
Oh , Mammy .
and then this evening , Miss Scarlett , she shout through the door ... and she say the funeral set for tomorrow morning ... and he says , &quot; You try that and I kills you tomorrow .
&quot; do you think I &apos;s going to put my child ...
&quot; in the dark when she &apos;s so scared of it ? &quot;
Oh , Mammy , he has lost his mind .
Yes , ma &apos;am , that &apos;s the God &apos;s truth . he ain &apos;t going to let us bury that child . you gotta help us , Miss Melly .
Mr. Rhett always set great store by your opinion .
please , Miss Melly .
I &apos;ll do what I can , Mammy .
Oh , Lord ... please help Mr. Rhett in this hour of his grief .
I want you to go and make a good deal of strong coffee ... and bring it up to Capt. Butler .
I &apos;ll go and see Miss Scarlett . but ...
Capt. Butler is quite willing for the funeral to take place ... tomorrow morning .
hallelujah . I suspects the angels fights on your side , Miss Melly . hallelujah .
Miss Melly ! Miss Melly ! Miss Melly !
send for Dr. Meade , Mammy ... and try ... try to get me home .
Miss Melly !
Miss Melly !
where is my mother going away to ?
and why can &apos;t I go along , please ?
we can &apos;t always go along , Beau , much as we may want to .
you &apos;re going back to bed now .
Oh , Rhett , she can &apos;t be dying , she can &apos;t be ! she hasn &apos;t your strength .
she &apos;s never had anything but heart . you knew that , too .
why do I have to go back to bed ?
it &apos;s morning .
it isn &apos;t really morning yet .
please let me see her !
I &apos;ve been waiting here two whole days and I &apos;ve got to tell her ... that I was wrong about something .
she knows you were wrong . she wants to see Scarlett .
it &apos;s me , Melly .
promise me ?
anything .
look after my little son .
I gave him to you once before .
remember ?
the day he was born .
please , Melly , don &apos;t talk this way .
I know you &apos;ll get well .
promise me ... college ...
Yes , and Europe , and a pony , whatever he wants . but ...
Melly , do try ... Ashley ...
Ashley and you . what about Ashley , Melly ?
look after him for me .
just as you ... looked after me for him .
look after him ... but never let him know .
good night .
promise ?
what else , Melly ?
Capt. Butler ... be kind to him . Rhett ?
he loves you so .
Yes , Melly .
you ladies may come in now .
Ashley .
I don &apos;t know where the mate to this is .
she must have put it away . Oh , stop it .
I &apos;m so frightened .
I &apos;m so frightened .
Oh , Scarlett , what can I do ?
I can &apos;t live without her , I can &apos;t .
everything I ever had ... is going with her . Oh , Ashley .
you really love her , don &apos;t you ?
she &apos;s the only dream I ever had that didn &apos;t die in the face of reality .
dreams !
always dreams with you , never common sense . Oh , Scarlett !
if you knew what I &apos;ve gone through !
Ashley , you should have told me years ago that you loved her and not me ... and not left me dangling with your talk of honor .
but you had to wait till now , now when Melly &apos;s dying ... to show me that I could never mean any more to you than ... than this Watling woman does to Rhett .
and I &apos;ve loved something that ... that doesn &apos;t really exist .
somehow ...
I don &apos;t care . somehow it doesn &apos;t matter .
it doesn &apos;t matter one bit .
Ashley , forgive me .
Melly ! Melly !
Rhett , Rhett !
Rhett , where are you ?
Rhett , wait for me .
Rhett .
Rhett ...
Melanie , she &apos;s ...
well , God rest her .
she was the only completely kind person I ever knew .
a great lady . a very great lady .
so she &apos;s dead .
that makes it nice for you , doesn &apos;t it ?
Oh , how can you say such a thing ?
you know how I loved her , really !
no , I don &apos;t know that I do .
but at least it &apos;s to your credit that you could appreciate her at the end . of course I appreciated her .
she thought of everybody except herself .
why , her last words were about you .
did she say anything else ? she said ...
she asked me to look after Ashley , too .
it &apos;s convenient to have the first wife &apos;s permission , isn &apos;t it ?
what do you mean ?
what are you doing ? I &apos;m leaving you , my dear .
all you need now is a divorce , and your dreams of Ashley can come true .
Oh , no !
no , you &apos;re wrong !
terribly wrong ! I don &apos;t want a divorce .
Oh , Rhett , when I knew tonight ... when I knew I loved you , I ran home to tell you .
Oh , darling , darling ... Please don &apos;t go on with this .
leave us some dignity to remember out of our marriage .
spare us this last . this last ? Oh , Rhett , do listen to me .
I must have loved you for years , only I was such a stupid fool I didn &apos;t know it .
please believe me . you must care .
Melly said you did .
I believe you . what about Ashley Wilkes ?
I never really loved Ashley .
you certainly gave a good imitation of it , up till this morning .
no , Scarlett . I tried everything .
if you &apos;d only met me halfway , even when I came back from London .
I was so glad to see you .
I was , Rhett , but you were so nasty . and then , when you were sick and it was all my fault ...
I hoped against hope that you &apos;d call for me , but you didn &apos;t .
I wanted you .
I wanted you desperately , but I didn &apos;t think you wanted me .
it seems we &apos;ve been at cross-purposes , doesn &apos;t it ?
but it &apos;s no use now .
as long as there was Bonnie , there was a chance we might be happy .
I liked to think that Bonnie was you .
a little girl again , before the war and poverty had done things to you .
she was so like you , and I could pet her and spoil her as I wanted to spoil you .
but when she went , she took everything .
Oh , Rhett ! Rhett , please don &apos;t say that . I &apos;m so sorry , I &apos;m so sorry for everything .
my darling , you &apos;re such a child .
you think that by saying , &quot; I &apos;m sorry , &quot; all the past can be corrected .
here , take my handkerchief .
Rhett , where are you going ?
I &apos;m going to Charleston . back where I belong . please .
please take me with you . no .
I &apos;m through with everything here .
I want peace . I want to see if somewhere there isn &apos;t something left in life of charm and grace .
- Do you know what I &apos;m talking about ?
- No . I only know that I love you .
that &apos;s your misfortune . Oh , Rhett .
Rhett !
Rhett !
if you go , where shall I go ?
what shall I do ? frankly , my dear , I don &apos;t give a damn .
Oh , I can &apos;t let him go !
I can &apos;t ! there must be some way to bring him back .
I can &apos;t think about this now .
I &apos;ll go crazy if I do !
I &apos;ll think about it tomorrow .
but I must think about it .
I must think about it .
what is there to do ?
what is there that matters ?
do you mean to tell me , Katie Scarlett O &apos;Hara ... that Tara doesn &apos;t mean anything to you ?
why , land &apos;s the only thing that matters . it &apos;s the only thing that lasts .
something you love better than me , though you may not know it .
Tara . it &apos;s this from which you get your strength .
the red earth of Tara .
why , land &apos;s the only thing that matters . it &apos;s the only thing that lasts .
something you love better than me , though you may not know it .
Tara . from which you get your strength . the red earth of Tara .
why , land &apos;s the only thing that matters .
something you love better than me .
the red earth of Tara .
- Tara ! - Tara ! Tara !
home !
I &apos;ll go home !
and I &apos;ll think of some way to get him back .
after all ... tomorrow is another day .
is there anything I can do for you , monsieur ?
no .
Yes , monsieur ?
just looking around .
comrades , why should we lie to each other ?
it &apos;s wonderful .
let &apos;s be honest .
have we anything like it in Russia ?
no .
can you imagine what the beds would be in a hotel like that ?
they tell me when you ring once , the valet comes in .
when you ring twice , you get a waiter .
and do you know what happens when you ring three times ?
a maid comes in , a French maid .
comrades , if we ring nine times ... Let &apos;s go in .
just a minute .
I have nothing against the idea , but I still say ... let &apos;s go back to the Hotel Terminus .
Moscow made our reservations there .
we are on an official mission ... and we have no right to change the orders of our superiors .
where is your courage , Comrade Buljanoff ?
are you the Buljanoff who fought on the barricades ?
and now you are afraid to take a room with a bath ?
I don &apos;t want to go to Siberia .
and I don &apos;t want to go to Hotel Terminus .
and I don &apos;t want to ...
- No . - Listen to me .
look , Buljanoff , if Lenin were alive , he would say :
&quot; Buljanoff , comrade , for once in your life you &apos;re in Paris .
&quot; don &apos;t be a fool .
go in there and ring three times . &quot;
he wouldn &apos;t say that .
what he would say is :
&quot; you can &apos;t afford to live in a cheap hotel .
&quot; doesn &apos;t the prestige of the Bolsheviks mean anything to you ?
&quot; do you want to live in a hotel ...
&quot; where you press for the hot water and cold water comes ...
&quot; and when you press for cold water , nothing comes at all ? &quot;
Phooey , Buljanoff .
I still say our place is with the common people .
but who am I to contradict Lenin ? let &apos;s go in .
- Are you the manager ?
- Yes , monsieur .
pardon me for introducing Comrade Iranoff ...
- member of the Russian Board of Trade .
- Monsieur .
- This is Comrade Kopalski . - Monsieur .
- And I am Comrade Buljanoff . - Monsieur .
may I ask you how much your rooms are ?
gentlemen , I &apos;m afraid our rates are rather high .
why should you be afraid ?
I might be able to accommodate you .
- Is there some more luggage ?
- Yes .
but have you a safe big enough to hold this ?
I &apos;m afraid we have no boxes of that size in the vault ...
- but there &apos;s a suite with a private safe . - That &apos;s even better .
- But , gentlemen , I &apos;m afraid ... - He &apos;s always afraid .
I just wanted to explain .
the apartment may suit your convenience ... but I doubt whether it will fit your convictions .
- It &apos;s the Royal Suite . - The Royal Suite ?
just a minute .
comrades , I warn you , if it gets out in Moscow that we stay in the Royal Suite ... we &apos;ll get into terrible trouble .
we &apos;ll tell them we had to do it on account of the safe .
that &apos;s a perfect excuse . there was no other safe big enough .
- That &apos;s right . - That &apos;s fine .
of course , we could take out the pieces ... and distribute them in three or four boxes in the vault ... and take a small room .
- That &apos;s an idea , isn &apos;t it ?
- Yes , that &apos;s an idea .
but who said we had to have an idea ?
- That &apos;s right . - That &apos;s very good .
- Give us the Royal Suite . - Step this way , please .
Hello .
please connect me with Mercier . Yes , the jeweler .
Hello ?
no , I want to speak to Monsieur Mercier personally .
Yes .
Hello , Monsieur Mercier ?
this is Iranoff , Member of the Russian Board of Trade .
Yes , we arrived this morning .
thank you very much .
Yes , we have everything here .
the necklace , too .
all 14 pieces , at the ... What ?
no , Monsieur Mercier .
the court jewels of the Grand Duchess Swana consisted of 14 pieces .
why don &apos;t you check on that ?
of course , we have all the necessary credentials .
take care of the Royal Suite . I &apos;ll be back in 10 minutes .
- All right , Rakonin . - Thank you very much .
- 8 rue de Chalon . - Bien , monsieur .
- Hello , Leon . - Good morning , Swana , darling .
it &apos;s really a wretched morning . I can &apos;t get myself right .
I wanted to look mellow and I look brittle .
my face doesn &apos;t compose well . it &apos;s all highlights .
how can I dim myself down , Leon ? suggest something .
I &apos;m so bored with this face . I wish I had someone else &apos;s face .
whose face would you have if you had your choice ?
I guess one gets the face one deserves .
there &apos;s one marvelous advantage to your composition .
however many questions you ask , you never expect an answer .
don &apos;t you find that restful ?
- Good morning , darling . - Good morning .
- Why didn &apos;t you come last night ? - I was looking after your interests .
did you win ?
we can forget horse racing , roulette , everything .
our worries are over .
you remember the platinum watch with the diamond numbers ?
you &apos;ll be in a position to give it to me now .
darling , you &apos;re so good to me .
we could be rich , if you say the word .
- I had dinner with the Guizots last night . - Those awful newspaper people .
you &apos;d be surprised how many nice people dine with them .
what a gruesome proof of the power of the press .
I sold Monsieur Guizot the idea of publishing your memoirs ...
- in the Gazette Parisienne . - What ?
&apos;The Life and Loves of the Grand Duchess Swana of Russia . &apos;
we won &apos;t have to worry about our future if you &apos;re willing to raffle off your past .
come in .
count Rakonin asks the privilege of a few words , Your Highness .
- Rakonin ?
- He &apos;s a waiter at the Clarence , poor devil .
- You know him . - Yes .
tell him I won &apos;t be able to see him for half an hour .
the Count says if it could be as soon as possible .
it &apos;s luncheon time , and he is between courses .
all right , I &apos;ll see him right away .
- I can &apos;t get myself right today ... - Count Rakonin &apos;s between courses .
my little Volga boatman .
- How do you do , my friend ? won &apos;t you sit ?
- Your Highness .
- Your Highness , forgive this intrusion ... - Have you lost your job ?
no , madame .
something of the utmost importance .
- It concerns your jewels . - My jewels ?
I remember one birthday of His Majesty , our beloved Czar ...
I had the honor of being on guard at his palace .
I still see you bending before His Majesty .
you wore your diadem and a necklace .
but why do you bring this up now ?
they are here . your jewels , here in Paris .
Alexis , do you know what you &apos;re saying ?
this morning , three Soviet agents arrived .
I overheard a telephone conversation with Mercier , the jeweler .
- They &apos;re going to sell them . - Did I hear something about jewels ?
Rakonin has just given me the most amazing news .
you know Count d &apos;AIgout . I must call my lawyer at once .
- I &apos;m sorry , Your Highness .
I have to leave . - I &apos;ll get in touch with you .
- Hello . Balzac , 2769 . - Au revoir , monsieur .
Au revoir .
this is the Grand Duchess Swana .
I want to speak to Monsieur Cornillon . it &apos;s very important . get him right away .
Hello , Monsieur Cornillon ?
the most incredible thing has happened . my jewels are here in Paris .
three Bolshevik swine are trying to sell them .
Yes !
now , we must act immediately .
call the police , have them arrested .
well , then get an injunction .
but do something , Monsieur Cornillon !
but they are my jewels .
there must be some way of getting them back .
what does he say ?
but how can there be a question ?
are you my lawyer or theirs ?
it &apos;s all right .
Yes , all right , I will call you later .
- What did he say ?
- They &apos;re pretty hopeless .
there may be a chance , that &apos;s all .
the French government has recognized Soviet Russia ... and he doubts that they will risk a war for my poor sake .
he might be able to make up some kind of a case , but it would cost money .
money , that &apos;s all they are interested in , those lawyers .
darling , calm down . why do you need a lawyer ?
haven &apos;t you your little Volga boatman ?
very good , excellent , superb .
it &apos;d be foolish to belittle the quality of the merchandise ... but your terms are impossible .
my counteroffer is the absolute maximum .
but Monsieur Mercier ...
gentlemen , I &apos;m going to let you in on a little secret .
we are undertaking this deal only because of the prestige involved .
and , frankly , we &apos;re expected to take a loss .
capitalistic methods .
they accumulate millions by taking loss after loss .
this is Buljanoff , Iranoff , and Kopalski .
who ?
count d &apos;AIgout ?
no , that must be a mistake .
no , we can &apos;t be disturbed .
I assure you no one else can meet the figure named by my syndicate .
at least not under these economic conditions .
we can wait .
do we give the impression of people who are pressed for money ?
Yes .
gentlemen , let &apos;s put our cards on the table .
right now , there &apos;s a Russian commission in New York ... trying to sell 15 Rembrandts .
another in London mortgaging the oil fields in Baku .
you need money , and quickly .
my offer is a very fair one , and doesn &apos;t even take advantage of your situation .
just a minute .
- Now , listen . - We have just a minute .
- The pieces are all registered . - I know . thank you so much .
- He &apos;s cutting our throat . - What can we do ? we have to accept .
comrades , don &apos;t let &apos;s give in so quickly .
after all , we have to uphold the prestige of Russia .
all right , let &apos;s uphold it for another 10 minutes .
- We don &apos;t want to be disturbed . - My name is d &apos;AIgout .
I telephoned .
if you want to see us , you must come in later .
- Just a word with Mercier . - You can &apos;t come in .
monsieur Mercier , may I introduce myself ?
I &apos;m Leon d &apos;AIgout .
I had the pleasure of meeting you in your beautiful shop .
I was admiring the platinum watch with the diamond numbers .
- Yes , of course . - You remember , I ...
glorious , aren &apos;t they ?
- You have no right . - I did not permit you to come in here .
just a moment .
I hope you haven &apos;t closed this deal .
- It may bring you serious trouble .
- Who are you and what do you want ?
those jewels belong to Grand Duchess Swana ... and were seized illegally by the Soviet government .
I am acting for Her Highness .
here is my power of attorney .
you know , Monsieur Mercier , this is all nonsense .
these may have been the jewels of the Grand Duchess Swana ... but like all private property , they were confiscated by the State .
we &apos;ll leave the problem of ownership to the French courts .
Meanwhile , I have filed a petition for an injunction ... to prohibit you from either selling or removing the jewels .
here is a copy .
if there is anything which isn &apos;t clear , I shall be glad to explain it .
thank you .
gentlemen , this introduces a new element into our negotiations .
- Until this claim is completely settled ... - We can call our ambassador .
I give you my word , they were confiscated legally .
that &apos;s right .
hold on , gentlemen , please try to understand my position .
I am not withdrawing .
my offer stands .
when you can produce a clear title approved by the French courts ... we can close the deal .
until then , gentlemen , good day .
I thought it my duty to warn you . I should have hated ...
- to see you in trouble . - Thank you .
- I hope you will forgive me . - I consider myself very lucky .
- Good day . - Good day , monsieur .
you believe me , I ...
gentlemen , how about a little lunch ?
- Will you get out of here !
- Yes , get out .
but don &apos;t look so gloomy . you may have a chance .
- We may have a chance ? - That &apos;s ridiculous .
Yes , a very slim one .
I want to be fair .
I don &apos;t deny that you might have a case .
we haven &apos;t anything to discuss with you . we &apos;ll talk to a lawyer .
you talk to a lawyer and I &apos;ll talk to a judge .
that won &apos;t help you . you can &apos;t intimidate us .
Soviet Russia will put all its might behind this case .
Yes .
you think because you represent the former Grand Duchess ...
- The Grand Duchess . - The former Grand Duchess .
at any rate , gentlemen , a charming , exquisite woman .
I warn you , if this case comes to trial , it will be before a French court .
and when the Grand Duchess takes the stand ...
go ahead , get her on the witness stand . what can she say ?
but how will she look ?
the fashions this spring are very becoming to her .
gentlemen , the judge will be French , the jury will be French ... everybody in the courtroom will be French .
have you seen a French court when a beautiful woman sits on the stand ... and raises her skirt a little ?
you sit down and pull up your pants and where would it get you ?
I suppose you expect us to hand over the jewels ?
no , I &apos;m not a highwayman , just a nuisance .
all I want to do is make things as difficult as possible .
not that we are giving in one inch , but tell us what is in your mind ?
Yeah .
- What about my proposition ? - What proposition ?
I just said , let &apos;s have some lunch .
Hey , Sasha , Sergei , Misha .
what ?
what do you want ?
what can we do for you ?
that telegram from Moscow , why should you bother about it ?
- I &apos;ve written it for you . - Leon , Leonitchka .
why are you so good to us ?
that &apos;s very nice , boys . now , wait a minute .
what was the name of that Commissar of the Board of Trade ?
Razinin .
Commissar Razinin , Board of Trade , Moscow .
- You wouldn &apos;t like Razinin . - No , he &apos;s a bad man .
- He sends people to Siberia . - We don &apos;t like Razinin .
- No . - We don &apos;t like him .
we like Leon .
don &apos;t we like Leon ?
Yes !
wait a minute .
now wait a minute , how &apos;s this ?
&quot; Commissar Razinin , Board of Trade , Moscow .
unexpected situation here .
&quot; grand Duchess Swana in Paris , claims jewels ...
&quot; and has already brought injunction against sale or removal .
&quot; after long and serious study ...
&quot; we suggest in the interest of our beloved country ...
&quot; a 50-50 settlement as best solution .
&quot; Iranoff , Buljanoff , and Kopalski . &quot;
if we say that , we &apos;ll all be sent to Siberia .
- And if we have to go to Siberia ... - I will send you a muff .
Leon , why are you so good to us ?
comrade waiter !
why are you so good to us ?
get the champagne to the other room .
that &apos;s enough .
go along .
- Take this to the telegraph office at once . - Yes , monsieur .
Hello .
Yes , Leon . what is it , Leon ?
you can &apos;t hurry such things .
you must give Moscow a little time .
there &apos;s nothing we can do about it .
why don &apos;t you drop in later ?
Yes .
Au revoir .
what &apos;s the matter ?
this is a telegram from Moscow . it must have been here all day .
&quot; Halt negotiations immediately .
&quot; envoy Extraordinary arrives Thursday 5 : 20 p.m. With full power .
&quot; your authority cancelled herewith . Razinin . &quot;
- It is Thursday . - It &apos;s 5 : 00 already .
I always said it would be Siberia .
give me the desk , please .
this is this is the Royal Suite , Iranoff speaking .
listen , a special envoy is coming from Moscow today .
he &apos;ll occupy the Royal Suite .
move our things to the smallest room you &apos;ve got .
Yes . right away , instantly .
pass , please .
now this is a fine thing . maybe we &apos;ve missed him already .
how can we find somebody without knowing what he looks like ?
that must be the one .
Yes , he looks like a comrade .
Heil Hitler .
- No , that &apos;s not him . - Positively not .
- What are we going to do now ? - I don &apos;t know .
we must have missed him .
I &apos;m looking for Michael Simonovitch Iranoff .
I am Michael Simonovitch Iranoff .
I am Nina Ivanovna Yakushova , Envoy Extraordinary ... acting under direct orders of Comrade Commissar Razinin .
present me to your colleagues .
- Comrade Buljanoff . - Comrade .
- Comrade Kopalski . - Comrade .
what a charming idea for Moscow to surprise us with a lady comrade .
if we had known , we would have greeted you with flowers .
don &apos;t make an issue of my womanhood .
we are here for work , all of us . let &apos;s not waste any time . shall we go ?
porter , here , please .
what do you want ?
- May I have your bags , madame ? - Why ?
- He is a porter , he wants to carry them . - Why ?
why should you carry other people &apos;s bags ?
that &apos;s my business , madame .
that &apos;s no business . that &apos;s social injustice .
that depends on the tip .
- Allow me , comrade . - No , thank you .
ticket , please .
- How are things in Moscow ? - Very good .
the last mass trials were a great success .
there are going to be fewer but better Russians .
what &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s a hat , comrade .
a woman &apos;s hat .
how can such a civilization survive ... which permits their women to put things like that on their heads ?
it won &apos;t be long now , comrades .
this is the apartment we have reserved for you , Comrade Yakushova .
I hope you like it .
which part of the room is mine ?
you see , comrade , it &apos;s a little different here .
they don &apos;t rent rooms in pieces . we had to take the whole suite .
- How much does this cost ?
- 2,000 francs .
- A week ?
- A day .
do you know how much a cow costs , Comrade Iranoff ?
- A cow ?
- 2,000 francs .
if I stay here a week , I will cost the Russian people seven cows .
who am I to cost the Russian people seven cows ?
we had to take it on account of the safe .
for ourselves , we are much happier now ... since we moved to a little room right next to the servants &apos; quarters .
I &apos;m ashamed to put a picture of Lenin in a room like this .
- Do you want to be alone , comrade ?
- No .
comrades , your telegram was received with great disfavor in Moscow .
we did our best , comrade .
I hope so , for your sake . let &apos;s examine the case .
- What does the lawyer say ?
- Which lawyer ?
you didn &apos;t get legal advice ?
we dealt directly with the representative of the Grand Duchess .
I am sure if you call him , he will give you a very clear picture .
I will not repeat your mistake .
I will have no dealings with the Grand Duchess nor her representative .
- Comrade Buljanoff ?
- Yes , comrade ?
do you spell Buljanoff with one or two &quot; F &apos;s &quot; ?
with two &quot; F &apos;s , &quot; if you please .
have you some cigarettes ?
this is the Royal Suite . please send up some cigarettes .
Yes .
you just telephone and you get what you want .
that &apos;s the capitalistic system .
comrades , I am not in a position to pass final judgment .
but at best , you &apos;ve been careless in your duty to the State .
you were entrusted with more than a mere sale of jewelry .
why are we peddling our precious possessions to the world at this time ?
our next year &apos;s crop is in danger and you know it .
unless we can get foreign currency to buy tractors ... there will not be enough bread for our people .
- And you , comrades ... - We did it with the best intentions .
we can &apos;t feed the Russian people on your intentions .
fifty percent to a so-called Grand Duchess .
half of every loaf of bread to our enemy .
- Comrade Kopalski . - Yes , comrade .
go at once to our embassy and get me the address of the best lawyer in Paris .
Yes , comrade .
comrade Iranoff , go to the public library ... and get me the section of the Civil Code on property .
- Is there anything I can do , comrade ?
- Yes .
you might get me an accurate map of Paris .
I want to use my spare time to inspect public utilities ... and to make a study of all outstanding technical achievements in the city .
Yes , comrade .
come in .
- Hello . cigarettes ?
- Hello .
comrades , you must have been smoking a lot .
desk .
Yes , Monsieur Kopalski .
you are expecting Count d &apos;AIgout ?
but he is not to go to the Royal Suite under any circumstances .
he should go to your new room , 985 .
thank you , monsieur .
you , please .
me ?
could you give me some information ?
gladly .
how long must we wait here ?
well , until the policeman blows his whistle again .
- At what intervals does he whistle ?
- What ?
how many minutes between the first and second whistle ?
that &apos;s very funny .
I never thought of that before .
you &apos;ve never been caught in a similar situation ?
Yes , I have .
now that I come to think about it , it &apos;s staggering .
good heavens , if I add it up , I must have spent years waiting for signals .
imagine , an important part of my life wasted between whistles .
- In other words , you don &apos;t know ?
- No .
- Thank you . - You &apos;re welcome .
can I be of any assistance to you ?
- You might hold this for me . - I &apos;d love to .
correct me if I am wrong .
- We are facing north , aren &apos;t we ?
- Facing north ?
I would hate to commit myself without my compass .
- Pardon me , are you an explorer ?
- No , I am looking for the Eiffel Tower .
good heavens , is that thing lost again ?
are you interested in a view ?
I &apos;m interested in the Eiffel Tower from a technical standpoint .
technical ?
no , I &apos;m afraid I couldn &apos;t be of much help from that angle .
a Parisian only goes to the Tower in moments of despair to jump off .
how long does it take a man to land ?
now isn &apos;t that too bad ? the last time I jumped , I forgot to time it .
let me see now , the Eiffel Tower ...
your finger , please .
why do you need my finger ?
it &apos;s bad manners to point with your own .
there , the Eiffel Tower .
and where are we ?
where are we ?
now , let me see .
here we are .
there you are and here am I .
feel it ?
I &apos;m interested only in the shortest distance between these two points .
- Must you flirt ?
- Well , I don &apos;t have to but I find it natural .
- Suppress it . - I &apos;ll try .
for my own information ... would you call your approach toward me typical of the local morale ?
it is that approach which has made Paris what it is .
you &apos;re very sure of yourself , aren &apos;t you ?
nothing &apos;s happened recently to shake my self-confidence .
I have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society .
it is having a superior earning power that makes you that way .
a Russian .
I love Russians .
comrade , I &apos;ve been fascinated by your Five-Year Plan for the last 15 years .
your type will soon be extinct .
taxi !
can you tell me the exact width of the foundation ... on which these piers are resting , and the depth ?
you don &apos;t have to worry .
the thing is safe .
- I am not afraid ... - &quot; The foundation is 141 yards square . &quot;
- I hope you &apos;ll forgive me but I thought ... - Go on .
&quot; four massive pieces of masonry are sunk to a depth of 46 feet ...
&quot; on the side of the Seine , and 29.5 feet on the other side .
&quot; the girders of interlaced ironwork , which stay the structure ...
&quot; have an inclination of 54 degrees . &quot;
- That &apos;s a strange angle . - Yes , that &apos;s very strange .
&quot; Ascending to the first platform is a staircase consisting of ...
&quot; 829 steps . &quot;
&quot; and an additional 254 steps to the very top .
&quot; there &apos;s an elevator included in the price of admission . &quot;
it &apos;ll take you hours to walk up there .
the elevator will get you up in three minutes .
you gave me some very valuable information .
thank you .
thank you for getting me up here . I &apos;ve never seen this before .
- Beautiful , isn &apos;t it ?
- Yes , it is .
I &apos;m glad I saw it before becoming extinct .
now don &apos;t misunderstand me .
I do not hold your frivolity against you .
as basic material , you may not be bad .
but you are the unfortunate product of a doomed culture .
I feel very sorry for you .
but you must admit that this doomed old civilization sparkles .
look at it . it glitters .
I do not deny its beauty , but it &apos;s a waste of electricity .
what a city .
there are the grand boulevards blasted out of the heart of the old city .
the Arc de Triomphe , built to greet Napoleon &apos;s army .
the Opera .
Montparnasse . Montmartre .
and now , I &apos;ll show you the greatest attraction of all .
it &apos;ll cost me a franc , but it &apos;s worth it .
the most unique spot in all Paris . really , I &apos;m not exaggerating .
it &apos;s wonderful . it &apos;s charming .
it &apos;s ...
please .
what do you see ?
I see a house . looks like any other house .
- What &apos;s remarkable about it ? - It &apos;s not the structure .
it &apos;s the spirit that dwells within it .
it has three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality .
- So it &apos;s your house ? - Let &apos;s say I live in it .
it &apos;s such a pleasant little place . it has all the comforts .
easy to reach , near the subway , bus , and streetcar ...
- Does it mean you want me to go there ? - Please , don &apos;t misunderstand me .
- Then you don &apos;t want me to go there ?
- No .
I didn &apos;t say that either . nothing would please me more .
then why don &apos;t we go ?
you might be an interesting subject of study .
I &apos;ll do my best .
- Good evening , Gaston . - Good evening , monsieur .
- Is this what you call the &quot; butler &quot; ?
- Yes .
good evening , comrade .
this man is very old . you shouldn &apos;t make him work .
he takes good care of that .
he looks sad . do you whip him ?
no , but the mere thought makes my mouth water .
the day will come when you will be free .
go to bed , little father . we want to be alone .
please .
count d &apos;AIgout , there have been several telephone calls .
go to bed , little father .
- Now , may I offer you a drink ? - Thank you , I &apos;m not thirsty .
perhaps something to eat .
I &apos;ve had all the calories necessary for today .
Yes , all the calories .
what do we do now ?
- Shall we have some music ? - Is that customary ?
it helps .
it has ever since King David wooed Bathsheba with his harp .
not being so fortunate as to have my harp at hand , I &apos;ll turn on the radio .
if there &apos;s anything you &apos;d like to study , please go ahead .
I &apos;ve nothing to conceal .
this is my desk , these are my books , and here am I .
where shall we begin ?
- I will start with you . - Excellent .
let &apos;s see , I &apos;m 35 years old , just over 6 feet tall ... and weigh 182 pounds , stripped .
what is your profession ?
my profession ?
keeping my body fit , keeping my mind alert ... and keeping the landlord appeased , that &apos;s a full-time job .
and what do you do for mankind ?
for mankind ?
Yes , not so much for mankind .
but for womankind , my record isn &apos;t quite so bleak .
you are something we do not have in Russia .
thank you .
glad you told me .
that &apos;s why I believe in the future of my country .
I &apos;m beginning to believe in it myself since I &apos;ve met you .
I still don &apos;t quite know what it &apos;s all about .
it confuses me , frightens me .
but it fascinates me .
Ninotchka ... do you like me just a little bit ?
your general appearance is not distasteful .
thank you .
the whites of your eyes are clear .
your cornea is excellent .
your cornea is terrific .
Ninotchka , tell me . you &apos;re so expert on things .
can it be that I &apos;m falling in love with you ?
why must you bring in wrong values ?
love is a romantic designation for a most ordinary biological ... or shall we say &quot; chemical , &quot; process .
a lot of nonsense is talked and written about it .
I see .
what do you use instead ?
I acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all .
what can I possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you ?
you don &apos;t have to do a thing .
Chemically , we are already quite sympathetic .
you are the most incredible creature I &apos;ve ever met .
Ninotchka .
you repeat yourself .
Yes , I &apos;d like to say it 1,000 times .
you must forgive me if I seem a little old-fashioned .
after all , I &apos;m just a poor bourgeois .
it &apos;s never too late to change .
I used to belong to the petite bourgeoisie myself .
no .
my father and mother wanted me to stay and work on the farm .
but I preferred the bayonet .
the bayonet ?
did you really ?
- I was wounded before Warsaw . - Wounded , how ?
I was a sergeant in the Third Cavalry Brigade .
would you like to see my wound ?
I &apos;d love to .
a Polish lancer .
I was 16 .
poor Ninotchka .
don &apos;t pity me . pity the Polish lancer . after all , I &apos;m still alive .
what kind of a girl are you , anyway ?
just what you see .
a tiny cog in the great wheel of evolution .
you &apos;re the most adorable cog I &apos;ve ever seen .
Ninotchka , let me confess something .
never did I dream I could feel like this toward a sergeant .
do you hear that ?
- It &apos;s 12 : 00 . - It &apos;s midnight .
look at the clock . one hand has met the other hand . they kiss .
isn &apos;t that wonderful ?
that &apos;s the way a clock works . what &apos;s wonderful about it ?
Ninotchka , it &apos;s midnight .
one half of Paris is making love to the other half .
you merely feel you must put yourself in a romantic mood ... to add to your exhilaration .
I can &apos;t possibly think of any better reason .
that &apos;s false sentimentality .
you analyze everything out of existence .
you &apos;d analyze me out of existence , but I won &apos;t let you .
love isn &apos;t so simple , Ninotchka .
Ninotchka , why do doves bill and coo ?
why do snails , the coldest of all creatures ... circle interminably around each other ?
why do moths fly hundreds of miles to find their mates ?
why do flowers slowly open their petals ?
Ninotchka , surely you feel some slight symptom of the divine passion ?
a general warmth in the palms of your hands .
a strange heaviness in your limbs .
a burning of the lips that isn &apos;t thirst ... but something 1,000 times more tantalizing , more exalting than thirst .
you are very talkative .
was that talkative ?
no . that was restful .
again .
thank you .
my barbaric Ninotchka ... my impossible , unromantic , statistical ...
again .
- The telephone is ringing . - Let it ring .
one of your friends may be in need of you .
you must answer .
Hello .
Yes .
what ?
Yes . well , I &apos;m sorry . I couldn &apos;t make it .
no , I ran into an old friend from the army .
what ?
the whole deal is off ? are you crazy , Buljanoff ?
a special envoy arrived .
I &apos;ll be glad to see her whenever she wants to .
she doesn &apos;t want to see me ?
what do you know about that ?
I &apos;ll get in touch with her myself . what &apos;s her name ?
good heavens , these Russian names .
how do you spell it ?
Y-A ...
&quot; Yakushova . &quot;
thanks .
Yakushova Ninotchka .
Yes , all right , thank you .
I must go .
or should I say &quot; Special Envoy Yakushova &quot; ?
- Let &apos;s forget we ever met . - No , I have a much better suggestion .
let &apos;s forget the telephone ever rang . I never heard that you are Yakushova .
you are Ninotchka , my Ninotchka .
I was sent here by my country to fight you .
all right , fight me as much as you want , only fight me tomorrow morning .
there &apos;s nothing sweeter than sharing a secret with an enemy .
you represent White Russia and I represent Red Russia .
tonight let &apos;s not represent anybody but ourselves .
it is out of the question .
- Lf you wish to approach me ... - You know I want to .
then do it through my lawyer .
but Ninotchka , you can &apos;t walk out like this .
I am crazy about you .
I thought I &apos;d made an impression on you . you liked the white of my eye .
I must go .
I held you in my arms .
you kissed me .
I kissed a Polish lancer , too ... before he died .
Yes , Marianne darling .
no , you didn &apos;t waken me . I &apos;m not only up , I &apos;m on my way out .
Yes , I want to catch Leon before he rushes out ... and loses himself in my business affairs .
everything was going perfectly until three days ago ... when some horrid female envoy arrived from Moscow .
now , we don &apos;t know where we are .
I &apos;ll telephone you tonight , darling .
Goodbye , dear .
I seem to remember some additional injunctive provision ... dealing with the property of foreigners residing in France .
you are referring to Paragraph 59B , Section 25F of the Civil Code .
page 824 .
and do not fail to read the three footnotes .
while you are studying it , I will eat .
- Where to , madame ? - Can you recommend a restaurant ?
there &apos;s Grenier if you care for seafood .
- Where do you eat ? - At Pere Mathieu .
- Where is that ?
- It &apos;s just a place for workmen .
- Where is it ?
- Down eight blocks , rue de Provelles .
thank you .
are you alone , madame ?
a nice little corner table ?
or perhaps by the window would be better ?
this way , madame .
I think this is the first time you &apos;ve been in my little place .
your face is new to me .
now what shall it be ?
raw beets and carrots .
Madame , this is a restaurant , not a meadow .
now , here &apos;s what we are offering today .
please make your choice .
I &apos;m sure you will find something to tempt your appetite .
well , for goodness &apos; sake , hello .
it certainly is a small world , isn &apos;t it ?
well , madame , shall we start with soup ?
fish soup today .
I got up at 5 : 00 to fish them from the Seine .
- Crawfish soup for me . - Very well , monsieur .
then may I suggest an omelet with mushrooms ?
bring me something simple . I never think about food .
Madame , if you don &apos;t think about food , what do you think about ?
the future of the common people .
that &apos;s also a question of food .
I will bring you a nice little lunch , a la Pere Mathieu .
may I say something ?
you insulted him , do you know that ? you hurt his feelings .
it &apos;s just like telling a musician that you don &apos;t like music .
that good old man believes in food just as you believe in Karl Marx .
you can &apos;t go around hurting people like that , Comrade Yakushova .
but you can make it up to him . do you know how ?
by eating everything that he brings you with relish ... by drinking everything with gusto ... by having a good time for the first time in your natural life .
- I don &apos;t like you following me . - I didn &apos;t follow you .
- How did you get here ? - I always eat here .
this is a place for working men .
but my dear child , I am most at home among working men .
I hate those places where you circulate , the Clarence Hotel and those places .
this is my natural element .
after all , what are any of us ?
working men .
at least , those of us who are worth our salt .
- Hiya !
- Hi .
Hiya , boys . how &apos;s everything today ?
- Is the lunch all right ?
- Fine .
- Pay our check . - Thank you , I will .
great bunch of fellows .
my friend , I am happy to see you again .
I &apos;m always glad to meet a new customer .
and I hope this first visit will not be your last one .
he &apos;s just an old man . his memory is weak .
what are you after ?
must one always be after something ?
your tactics are useless .
I &apos;m not Buljanoff , Iranoff , or Kopalski .
Ninotchka , why must we talk business ?
if you win the suit , fine . if we win the suit , better .
you do me an injustice .
Ninotchka , when we first went to my apartment ... did I have the slightest idea that you were connected with this deal ?
you know now .
I know now that you &apos;re a man who employs business methods ... which in Russia would be punished by death .
death , always so glum .
what about life , Ninotchka ? do Russians never think about life ?
of the moment in which we are living ? the only moment we ever really have .
don &apos;t take things so seriously . nothing &apos;s worth it , really .
please , relax .
I beg you , Sergeant .
- Smile . - What ?
- Will you smile ?
- Why ?
- Well , just smile . - At what ?
at anything .
at the whole ridiculous spectacle of life , at people being so serious ... taking themselves pompously , exaggerating their own importance .
if you can &apos;t think of anything to laugh at , you can laugh at us .
- Why ?
- Because we &apos;re an odd couple .
then you should go back to your table .
no , I can &apos;t leave you . I won &apos;t , not yet .
not until I &apos;ve made you laugh at least once .
now go back to your table .
that &apos;s not a laugh .
I mean a laugh from the heart .
I know .
I &apos;m going to tell you a funny story .
wait a minute , let me think of one .
I &apos;ve got it .
it seems that there were two Frenchmen who went to America ...
on which boat ?
let &apos;s drop it .
I don &apos;t think you &apos;d care very much for that one anyway .
probably not .
here &apos;s a great one .
maybe it &apos;s not so good . let &apos;s forget it .
- Do you like Scotch stories ? - Never heard one .
well , here .
two Scotchmen met on the street .
and I don &apos;t know the name of the street .
it doesn &apos;t matter anyway .
one &apos;s name was McGillicuddy and the other one &apos;s name was Mclntosh .
McGillicuddy said to Mclntosh , &quot; Hello , Mr. McGillicuddy . &quot;
and McGillicuddy ... Mclntosh said to McGillicuddy :
&quot; Hello , Mr. McGillicuddy . &quot;
then McGillicuddy said to Mclntosh , &quot; How is Mrs. Mclntosh ? &quot;
and Mclntosh said to McGillicuddy , &quot; How is Mrs. McGillicuddy ? &quot;
I wish they &apos;d never met .
so do I .
how is this one ?
two men are looking at the moon .
one of them says to the other :
&quot; is it true that a lot of people live on the moon ? &quot;
the other one says , &quot; Sure it &apos;s true , about 500 million . &quot;
then the first one says :
&quot; they must be pretty crowded when it &apos;s half-moon . &quot;
- So you don &apos;t think that &apos;s funny ?
- No .
it seemed funny to me when I first heard it .
maybe the trouble isn &apos;t with the joke . maybe it &apos;s with you .
I don &apos;t think so .
I &apos;ll give you one more chance .
here goes .
when I first heard this joke , I laughed myself sick .
here goes .
a man comes into a restaurant .
he sits down at the table and he says , &quot; Waiter ...
&quot; bring me a cup of coffee without cream . &quot;
five minutes later the waiter comes back and says ...
&quot; I &apos;m sorry , sir . we have no cream . can it be without milk ? &quot;
it &apos;s good , isn &apos;t it ?
- Not funny ?
- No .
well , it is funny !
everybody else thought it was funny !
maybe you didn &apos;t get the point .
I &apos;ll tell it to you again .
a man comes into a restaurant .
- Did you get that ?
- Yes .
all right .
he sits down at the table and he says to the waiter ... Did you get that ?
- Yes . - It isn &apos;t funny so far , but wait a minute .
he says to the waiter , &quot; Waiter , bring me a cup of coffee . &quot;
five minutes later , the waiter comes and says :
&quot; I &apos;m sorry , sir , we &apos;re all out of coffee . &quot;
no , you &apos;ve got me all mixed up now .
sits down at the table , says , &quot; Bring me a cup of coffee . &quot; that &apos;s it .
he says , &quot; Bring me a cup of coffee without cream . &quot;
five minutes later , the waiter comes back and says :
&quot; I &apos;m sorry , sir . we have no cream . can it be a glass of milk ? &quot;
you have no sense of humor !
none whatsoever .
not a grain of humor in you . there &apos;s not a laugh in you .
everybody else laughs at it , but not you .
what &apos;s so funny about this ?
in addition to the arguments above enumerated for lifting this injunction ... we wish to cite the decision of the High Court of Paris rendered in the case ... of Princess Marishka against the Government of Montenegro ... on the fifth day of August , 1897 .
comparing the facts in that case with our present set of facts ... we feel that the treaty between the Republic of France and the USSR ...
I &apos;m sorry , gentlemen .
the other day I heard such a funny story , it still makes me laugh .
it &apos;s very funny .
Yes , about this injunction .
the hearing is set for the twentieth of this month .
that &apos;s two weeks from Thursday .
we did our utmost to have it set ahead .
I know , gentlemen .
it &apos;s in the hands of the court . we &apos;re helpless , aren &apos;t we ?
Yes , it is unfortunate .
there &apos;s nothing we can do . why get excited ?
we &apos;ll leave these papers with you for your further consideration .
- Au revoir , madame . - Au revoir .
well , that means another two weeks in Paris .
too bad we have to waste all that time .
I acted on your suggestion ... and got in touch with the power and light authorities .
whenever you want to visit their plants , they are open to you .
Yes , power and light . thank you .
there is something else which I know will appeal to you .
a visit to the Paris sewers .
they tell me it &apos;s extremely instructive .
why don &apos;t you get a haircut , Buljanoff ?
you all look so wintry , comrades .
and why do we always keep the windows closed ?
isn &apos;t that amazing ?
at home , there is still snow and ice , and here , look at the birds .
I always felt a little hurt when our swallows deserted us ... in the winter for capitalistic countries .
now I know why .
we have the high ideal ... but they have the climate .
comrades , I don &apos;t think I need you anymore .
- Is there anything we can do for you ? - Not a thing .
would you like to go out ?
- Yes , sure .
- Have you any money ?
- Here are 50 francs . - Thank you .
bring me back 45 .
Yes , of course .
- Yes , that &apos;s fine . - Goodbye , comrade .
- Have you the time , Gaston ? - It &apos;s 8 : 42 , sir .
I guess it must be 8 : 42 .
- You seem to be a bit nervous , sir . - I am , Gaston .
if you &apos;ll forgive me , sir , ever since you met that Bolshevik lady ...
I &apos;ve noticed a distinct change in you , sir .
- Have you , Gaston ?
- Decidedly .
yesterday I was greatly amazed when I came from the market ... and found you &apos;d made your bed , sir .
Yes , I felt better for it all day long .
I felt as if I &apos;d contributed something .
may I add , sir , it was with great amazement ... that I found a copy of Karl Marx &apos;s Capital on your night table , sir .
that is a socialistic volume , which I refuse to so much as dust , sir .
I view with alarm the influence over you of this Bolshevik lady .
but I don &apos;t follow you , Gaston .
isn &apos;t it about time that you realized the unfairness of your position ?
your being my servant ... wouldn &apos;t you like to stand on an equal footing with me ?
no , sir .
good heavens , isn &apos;t there any revolt in you ?
when I order you around , don &apos;t you feel like kicking me in the pants ?
no , sir .
you &apos;re a reactionary .
you can &apos;t tell me that you don &apos;t look forward to the day ... when you can come in here , stand on your two feet ... and say , &quot; From now on , it &apos;s share and share alike . &quot;
emphatically not , sir . the prospect terrifies me .
now , don &apos;t misunderstand me , sir .
I don &apos;t resent your not paying me for the past two months ... but the thought that I should split my bank account with you ... that you should take half of my life &apos;s savings ... that is really too much for me , sir .
go to bed , little father , go to bed .
- I don &apos;t look too foolish ? - Foolish ?
if this dress were walking down the boulevard all by itself ...
I &apos;d follow it from one end of Paris to the other .
and when I caught up with it , I &apos;d say :
&quot; wait a moment , you charming little dress .
&quot; I want you to meet Ninotchka . you two were meant for each other . &quot;
remember this room ?
I &apos;ve never been here before .
I wonder whom you &apos;re thinking of ?
I know .
the girl with the map ... always figuring out each step and worrying about north and south .
today ...
now , this might shock you .
I walked up to a taxi , I said , &quot; 883 du Bois &quot; ... and here I am .
you see ?
life can be so simple .
- For 12 francs 75 .
- 12.75 ? from the Clarence ?
the son of a gun made a detour .
but he got you here .
it &apos;s 9 : 00 .
that &apos;s when one half of Paris says to the other half :
&quot; what are you plans for this evening , madame ? &apos;
first , I would like to take off my hat .
then , could we have some music ?
a wonderful idea .
- Radio or records ? - Not radio .
let &apos;s have music that &apos;s just for ourselves .
I &apos;ll play it very softly ... because I have things to tell you about , which I can &apos;t shout .
darling , I ...
you see , I couldn &apos;t shout that .
Oh , Leon .
Leon , you know the jokes you told me a few days ago ?
I wake up in the middle of the night and laugh at them .
you know , that &apos;s wrong .
they aren &apos;t funny .
they &apos;re silly , they &apos;re stupid .
and still I laugh at them .
and when I look at Buljanoff and Iranoff and Kopalski ...
I know they &apos;re scoundrels and I should hate them .
then I realize who made them like that .
and instead of sending my report to Moscow ...
I go down and buy a ridiculous hat .
and if this keeps on ...
- Am I too talkative ? - No , go on .
and Leon , I want to tell you something which I thought I would never say ... which I thought nobody ever should say , because I didn &apos;t think it exists .
and , Leon , I can &apos;t say it .
what a gesture for a sergeant .
- Leon , may I ask you something ?
- Anything .
if you don &apos;t want to answer , you needn &apos;t .
- But if you do , you must tell the truth . - I promise .
did you make any change in this room ?
I don &apos;t think so .
when I was here before , I noticed a photograph of a woman ... on the desk in a wide silver frame .
I thought , what a waste of silver . that &apos;s all I was interested in then .
now , I would like to know . what happened to the woman ?
the Grand Duchess ?
she &apos;s very attractive .
she has great elegance .
she &apos;s what you call a woman of the world , isn &apos;t she ?
Ninotchka .
I love you .
I suppose she &apos;s very entertaining .
it must be lots of fun to be with a woman like that , so witty and ...
Ninotchka .
you &apos;re jealous .
Leon , don &apos;t ever ask me for a picture of myself .
I couldn &apos;t bear the thought of being shut up in a drawer .
- I couldn &apos;t breathe .
I couldn &apos;t stand it . - Oh , my darling .
cafe de Lutece .
a table for tonight ? certainly , Count d &apos;AIgout .
what time , may I ask ?
after the opera , thank you very much .
good evening , Your Highness .
good evening .
you seem to be very crowded this evening .
- Can you manage a table near the floor ? - Certainly , this way please .
- Count d &apos;AIgout made the reservation . - Count d &apos;AIgout ?
Yes . it is only a small table , but we will put in some extra chairs .
no , that &apos;s another party .
let &apos;s go to some other place . it &apos;s so crowded here .
no . this is glory . at last I &apos;m going to have a look at that female Bolshevik .
can we manage another table ?
- Only one in the rear , I &apos;m afraid .
- Perfect .
you mean Leon &apos;s bringing the Bolshevik you told us about ?
- Isn &apos;t it divine ?
- I wouldn &apos;t have missed this for anything .
we must be very discreet .
if she sucks her soup ... or drinks out of her finger bowl , don &apos;t laugh .
we mustn &apos;t embarrass poor little Leon .
he &apos;s gone through enough for my sake . we mustn &apos;t add insult to injury .
is this satisfactory , Your Highness ?
- Is it to be dinner , Your Excellency ? - Later , perhaps .
- We &apos;ll just start with champagne . - Champagne .
I &apos;m only afraid the doorman may spoil all our fun . if only he lets her in .
- Look , there &apos;s Leon . - Where ?
good evening , Count d &apos;AIgout . if you please .
General , shall we dance ?
- Is it dry ?
- Yes , monsieur .
- Is that right , or do you prefer it sweet ?
- I wouldn &apos;t know .
the closest I ever came to champagne was in a newsreel .
the wife of some president was throwing it at a battleship .
it &apos;s always good luck to launch something with champagne .
a battleship or an evening .
it &apos;s funny to look back . I was brought up on goat &apos;s milk .
I had a ration of vodka in the army , and now champagne .
from goats to grapes .
that &apos;s drinking in the right direction .
it &apos;s good .
from what I &apos;ve read , I thought champagne was a strong drink .
it &apos;s delicate .
does anyone ever get drunk on this ?
well , there have been cases .
but the headache ... the next morning is worthwhile if you drink it with the right toast .
to us , Ninotchka .
thank you , General .
Hello , Leon !
how are you , my dear ?
- Hello , Swana .
good evening , General . - How do you do ?
you &apos;re looking magnificent tonight . isn &apos;t he , General ?
- Thank you .
- Is this your new dress suit ?
I told you Benson and Benson were the tailors for you .
- Yes , you did . - It &apos;s a dream of beauty .
never takes my word for anything .
- But I was right , wasn &apos;t I ?
- Yes .
- Am I interrupting ? - No , not at all .
your Highness , may I present Comrade Yakushova ?
how do you do ?
- General Savitzky . - How do you do ?
I &apos;ve some wonderful news about Punchy . do you mind if I sit down ?
no , please .
would you mind making my excuses at our table ?
- Certainly . - Will you say I &apos;ll be back soon ?
we can be proud of our Punchy . he had a triumph at the dog show .
he won another blue ribbon and bit the judge .
I bought him the loveliest little sweater as a reward .
you should see him strutting in it . he looks like a little boulevardier .
count d &apos;AIgout gave me Punchy for my birthday .
you must &apos;ve searched for weeks before you found anything as divine as Punchy ...
- didn &apos;t you , Leon ?
- Months , Swana .
poor Madame Yakushova . here we are talking in mysteries .
- I &apos;m sure you wonder what it &apos;s all about . - Not at all .
I understand perfectly .
count d &apos;AIgout gave you a dog .
you made it very clear , madame .
Oh , dear me .
I must be losing my finesse .
if I &apos;m not careful , I &apos;ll be understood by everybody .
- Charming crowd here tonight , isn &apos;t it ?
- I &apos;m going , Leon .
but before I go , I must compliment you on your gown , Madame Yakushova .
is that what they &apos;re wearing in Moscow this year ?
no , last year , madame .
isn &apos;t it amazing ? one gets the wrong impression of the new Russia .
it must be charming .
I &apos;m delighted conditions have improved so .
I assume this is what the factory workers wear at their dances ?
it would have been very embarrassing for people of my sort ... to wear low-cut gowns in the old Russia .
the lashes of the Cossacks across our backs were not very becoming .
and you know how vain women are .
Yes , you &apos;re quite right about the Cossacks .
we made a great mistake when we let them use their whips .
they had such reliable guns .
will you do me a favor ? let &apos;s not talk about the good old days .
Yes , it &apos;s a very wise suggestion .
I &apos;m afraid madame and I will never agree .
the only thing we have in common is our lawsuit ... and that will be settled next week .
I understand everything will be over by Thursday .
am I right ?
Yes . you &apos;re right , madame .
it &apos;ll all be over by Thursday .
it &apos;s too bad you have so few more days here in Paris .
Leon , be sure and redouble your efforts ... so madame can take some pleasant memories when she returns to Moscow .
- Good night , Leon . - Good night , Swana .
now I think I need a glass of champagne .
quickly , please tell me one of your funny stories .
a funny story ?
you never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names .
please .
well , there were two Scotchmen .
one &apos;s name was Mclntosh and the other one was McGillicuddy .
they met on the street .
no , I &apos;ll tell you another story .
a much better one .
the only thing that &apos;ll be over on Thursday will be the lawsuit .
there will be no Thursday for us .
next week or any other week .
I won &apos;t let it happen . I &apos;ll tear it out of the calendar .
isn &apos;t that a good story ?
wonderful , if one could believe it .
you must , darling .
to the loveliest story I ever heard .
let &apos;s dance .
Leon , something is the matter .
you just made that trip from goats to grapes a little too quickly .
everything is so wonderful .
it &apos;s getting farther and farther away .
- What , darling ?
- Thursday .
Yes , don &apos;t worry , everything &apos;s going to be all right .
comrades !
darling , please .
I want to talk to my brothers .
don &apos;t shush me , please . I am the people .
I want to hold a speech .
- I want to overthrow the Grand Duchess . - You can &apos;t do that .
Oh , comrades !
the good people of France !
- Now , Ninotchka . - But they &apos;re all grand duchesses here .
I ordered out thousands of grand duchesses and I want to tell them .
Yes , dear , you &apos;re quite right . but first , you &apos;re going through that door .
you &apos;re going to lie down and take some spirits of ammonia .
- No speech ?
- No speech .
I love you , my little Leonitchka .
and I adore you , Ninotchka . go ahead , now .
- No speech ?
- No . for heaven &apos;s sake , no speech .
- Give me a double brandy . - Yes , sir .
I &apos;m sorry , Count , it is most embarrassing , but the lady you brought with you ... is spreading communistic propaganda in the powder room .
what ?
give me another double brandy .
that kind of propaganda is bad anywhere , but inciting the attendants ... of the powder room to go on strike ?
if she succeeds , the consequences will be disastrous .
what can I do about it ?
she has been asked to leave the powder room , but without success .
we would appreciate it very much if you would see to it yourself .
- You want me to go in there ? - I &apos;m sorry , sir , but I must insist .
- Make it a triple brandy . - Yes , sir .
all right , tell the Grand Duchess . tell everybody .
they know it anyway . it doesn &apos;t make any difference .
get out .
- Don &apos;t tell them where we &apos;re going . - No , darling , nobody will find us .
- Are we going to build our little house ? - Yes , a little white house .
- No , not white . - All right , we &apos;ll make it red .
no , let &apos;s not have any color . no color .
just a &quot; house &quot; house .
- Let &apos;s form our own party . - Right .
lovers of the world , unite .
- And we won &apos;t stretch up our arms . - No !
- And we won &apos;t clench our fists . - No .
- Our salute will be a kiss . - Yes .
a kiss .
salute .
I am so happy .
no one can be so happy without being punished .
I will be punished , and I should be punished .
- Leon , I want to confess . - I know . it &apos;s the Russian soul .
well , everyone wants to confess .
and if they don &apos;t confess , they make them confess .
I am a traitor .
when I kissed you , I betrayed a Russian ideal .
I should be stood up against the wall .
- Would that make you any happier ? - Much happier .
all right .
I &apos;ve paid the penalty .
now , let &apos;s have some music .
- Yes , let &apos;s turn on the radio . - Radio ?
what &apos;s radio ?
radio &apos;s a little box that you buy on the installment plan ... and before you tune it in , they tell you there &apos;s a new model out .
Yes , I know where that is . there &apos;s one around here somewhere .
it has a little knob that you turn .
- A little knob , that &apos;s right . - Yeah . maybe it &apos;s in here .
- Just a little knob . - It &apos;s a radio and has a knob .
now , maybe it &apos;s in here . let &apos;s see . there it is .
- There &apos;s the knob . - There &apos;s the knob .
now , what shall we get , the news ?
no news .
we don &apos;t want to know what &apos;s happening in the world .
we want to be left alone , don &apos;t we ?
Yes , darling , all by ourselves .
then turn to the left and stop at seven .
turn to the left and stop at seven .
- No music . - No music .
there it is , Thursday .
you can &apos;t rip it out of the week .
there they are .
- They &apos;re terrible things , those jewels . - But big .
they are the tears of Old Russia .
- See that stone ? - Who cried that one ?
Czar Peter gave it to his wife , Catherine the Great .
for it he sold 10,000 serfs in the market .
but , darling , don &apos;t get impatient . wait till we &apos;re married .
you know that worthless butler of mine , that reactionary ?
some day I &apos;ll come home to you and I &apos;ll say :
&quot; darling , I drove Gaston to the market this morning ...
&quot; and look what I got for him . &quot;
darling , come here .
let me put this on you .
- No . - Yes , you will teach these jewels .
for the first time , they will learn how they can really look .
they belong to the people .
and I give them back to the people .
I make you Ninotchka the Great ...
Duchess of the People ...
grand Duchess of the People .
- Is this the wish of the masses ? - It is their wish .
thank you , Leon . thank you , masses .
- Can I make a speech now ? - Please .
comrades , people of the world .
the revolution is on the march . I know .
bombs will fall , civilization will crumble ... but not yet , please .
wait . what &apos;s the hurry ?
give us our moment . let &apos;s be happy .
- We &apos;re happy , aren &apos;t we , Leon ? - Yes , darling .
so happy and so tired .
smile , little father . smile .
come in .
- Good morning . - What ?
it &apos;s tomorrow morning .
tomorrow noon , to be exact . I hope you &apos;ll forgive me .
I know it &apos;s extremely cruel to awaken anyone at such an hour .
don &apos;t you recognize me ? I &apos;m the Grand Duchess Swana .
I know exactly how you feel , my dear .
the morning after always does look grim ... if you happen to be wearing last night &apos;s dress .
don &apos;t be embarrassed by my presence , though .
you couldn &apos;t have found anyone more sympathetic to your condition .
I think we can cut your visit short .
- Leon is not here . - Of course not , my dear .
I didn &apos;t come here with any such suspicion .
how ridiculous .
nor did I come here to pick up his hat .
what is it you people always say , regardless of what you mean ?
&quot; I &apos;m delighted to have you here . &quot;
I haven &apos;t reached that state of civilization , therefore I must ask you to leave .
leave ?
that &apos;s exactly what I came here to ask you to do . leave .
I don &apos;t mean this hotel , and I don &apos;t mean Paris . I mean France .
there &apos;s a plane for Moscow at 5 : 40 .
do you still think you &apos;re issuing orders from your palace in Petrograd ?
my palace in Petrograd .
Yes , you took that away from me .
you took away my czar , my country , my people .
everything I had .
but nothing more .
people cannot be taken away , madame ... neither 160 million nor one .
not if you have their love . you hadn &apos;t .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re not in Russia any longer ... and that &apos;s why you came here this morning .
problems were never solved by bowing from a balcony .
my dear , you don &apos;t know how impressive I could be .
did you ever see me in my regalia with my diadem and all my jewels ?
Elysee 2763 .
believe me , Leon can &apos;t help you .
he doesn &apos;t know anything about the jewels .
I give you my word . I swear it .
where are they ?
you were very careless with our precious jewels , my dear .
they &apos;re too expensive a toy for two children to play with .
where are they ?
don &apos;t worry , last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open .
he may have overstepped his function as a waiter ... but he fulfilled his duty as a Russian .
I just put this on for sentiment .
the rest are absolutely safe , I assure you .
- But if you feel like notifying the police ... - You leave me no choice .
won &apos;t it be rather embarrassing for a Soviet envoy ... to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them ?
I &apos;ll have to face the consequences , but so will you .
don &apos;t forget , they &apos;ll ask you how you got them .
that &apos;s very simple to answer . they were given to me by my mother .
they were given to her by her mother .
in fact , they &apos;re mine . you can &apos;t steal what belongs to you .
they always belonged to the Russian people .
they paid for them with their blood , their lives , and you &apos;ll give them back .
I told you we had plenty to talk about . shall we sit down ?
let &apos;s free ourselves from emotionalism ... and try to solve the problem in a practical way .
our situation has considerably changed .
before I had only a claim to the jewels .
now I have the jewels .
in other words , moral ideas have no weight with you .
all right , then let &apos;s deal with legal facts . you know ...
- France has recognized the Soviet . - Unfortunately .
under the Soviet law , the jewels belong to the State .
- France is going to uphold that ownership . - Yes , my lawyer agrees with you .
he says that France will uphold it in every court ... but I will drag you through every court , don &apos;t forget that .
and when I say it will take two years ...
I am , as always , conservative .
won &apos;t those two years in court be expensive for you ?
I know money was no object ... as long as you could squeeze it out of the pockets of the people .
I may run out of money , but you have already run out of bread .
two years is a long time for your comrades to wait .
I see .
you &apos;ve calculated it in terms of hunger .
no , I just wanted to be absolutely impartial .
both of us are faced with two rather uncomfortable years .
we can condense those two years to two minutes ...
- if you want to accept my proposition . - Go on .
I am willing to hand over the jewels and sign any necessary papers ... if you will take that 5 : 40 plane to Moscow .
that &apos;s not the way to win him back . not Leon .
I think I know Leon quite as well as you . perhaps a little better .
leave that worry to me .
now , 5 : 40 leaves you time enough to close the deal with Monsieur Mercier ... but naturally you &apos;II ... be too busy for any farewells .
I will see to it that everything is done in the most expeditious manner .
and I will also see you to the airport .
that &apos;s my proposition , Comrade Yakushova .
Yes ?
Hello .
Yes , Leon .
no , you didn &apos;t waken me .
I &apos;m fine , thank you .
Yes , it was wonderful .
for luncheon ?
I &apos;m afraid I can &apos;t .
I have lots of things to attend to today , Leon .
I &apos;m going to be very busy .
to tell you the truth , I &apos;m a little tired and I would like to rest .
maybe you &apos;re right .
perhaps it is the champagne .
for dinner ?
of course , 7 : 00 here .
7 : 00 will be all right .
come in .
Yes .
just a moment .
- You can leave it here . - Yes , madame .
operator , will you switch the call , please ?
darling , your present just arrived .
it &apos;s very silly and very wonderful .
what ?
I won &apos;t forget . 7 : 00 .
Goodbye , darling .
what ?
salute .
- Good afternoon , Jacqueline . - Good afternoon , Your Highness .
- Madame , I ... - Yes , I know .
you didn &apos;t find my other glove . it &apos;s all right .
you &apos;re forgiven .
thank you , Your Highness .
count d &apos;AIgout is waiting . he &apos;s been here for some time .
count d &apos;AIgout ?
Yes .
Leon , darling .
how nice .
- Have you ordered tea or a cocktail ?
- No , thanks , Swana .
did I act stupidly last night ?
should I apologize ?
no .
I &apos;m the one who should apologize . I should have talked to you before .
is this , by any chance , going to be a confession ?
- Yes . - No , my little Volga boatman .
have you forgotten our First Commandment ?
never complain , never explain .
it &apos;s worked so often and so perfectly in the past , let &apos;s not break the rule .
please don &apos;t look so guilty .
otherwise , I ...
Swana , just this once , I must ask you to listen to me .
all right .
- I &apos;m listening . - I know you hate the obvious .
but do you mind if , for the moment , I &apos;m not the least subtle ?
brutal frankness , if you insist .
there are 100 ways of approaching it ... but I feel it can best be said in one simple phrase .
I &apos;m in love , Swana .
I thought it was something serious . how could you frighten me so ?
it must be serious .
not so long ago I &apos;d have considered such a statement juvenile ... and rather middle-class .
now I can say it without a stammer , without a blush .
I &apos;m in love , Swana .
but , Leon , this has the ugly sound of regeneration .
- I &apos;m afraid that &apos;s what it is , Swana . - Always late .
same old trouble , Leon .
whether you take me to the opera ... or call for me at a beauty shop , you &apos;re never on time .
now , when it &apos;s a question of your reform , late again by about five minutes .
- What is this , Swana ?
- Knowing the efficiency ... of the French air service , I think I can safely guarantee ... that Madame Yakushova has taken off for Moscow .
- Has done what ?
- She &apos;s gone , Leon .
- You don &apos;t expect me to believe that ? - There &apos;s the telephone .
if you call the hotel , you &apos;ll find you have no 7 : 00 appointment .
imagine .
for once in our lives we were in Paris ...
- and we never went to the Eiffel Tower . - That &apos;s right .
they tell me it has a wonderful restaurant on the second floor .
Yes , it is an amazing piece of engineering ... still the most remarkable iron structure in the world .
leading to the top ... there is a staircase of over 1,000 steps ... but there is an elevator included in the price of admission .
everything &apos;s in order , I hope you will enjoy your trip to Russia .
thank you .
by the way , I &apos;ve heard so many rumors ... about laundry conditions in Russia .
is it advisable to take one &apos;s own towels ?
certainly not .
that is only capitalistic propaganda .
- We change the towel every week . - Thank you .
Hello . comrade Cazabine ?
no , I am sorry .
he hasn &apos;t been with us for six months .
he was called back to Russia and was investigated .
you can get further details from his widow . you &apos;re very welcome .
pardon me .
I was interested in what you were saying .
when an envoy goes back to Russia and they don &apos;t like what he &apos;s done ... they put him out of the way ?
not always .
look at me . I &apos;ve been back twice .
here &apos;s my passport . please give me a visa .
- I must leave for Russia immediately . - Count Leon d &apos;AIgout .
a count .
- A nobleman . - Don &apos;t hold that against me , please .
why should an aristocrat want to go to Russia ?
- Business . - What business ?
- Private . - There is no private business in Russia .
this whole thing seems very suspicious .
what is the real reason ?
if you ever want to get into Russia , take my advice .
confess .
listen .
I &apos;ll be absolutely frank with you .
- I have no business in Moscow . - I think so , too .
I want to see a friend of mine , a very dear friend .
it &apos;s a personal matter that has no relation to social philosophies or politics .
- It &apos;s a girl . - It is love which drags you to Moscow .
- Yes . - No visa .
- But I must get into that country of yours . - No visa .
but that &apos;s impossible .
you can &apos;t do it !
you haven &apos;t the right to ...
- Listen .
if you don &apos;t give me that visa ... - You &apos;re going to force us ?
you advertise all over the world for people to go into your country ... and when somebody tries , you won &apos;t let them !
- Why should I take a chance ? - On what ?
how do I know you don &apos;t want to blow up a factory ?
- What for ?
why ? - Or a tunnel , or a bridge ?
nothing but suspicions .
that &apos;s the trouble with you .
listen , if you don &apos;t let me in , I &apos;ll stand in front of this office of yours ... and warn people to keep away from Russia .
I &apos;ll picket your whole country . I &apos;ll boycott you , that &apos;s what I &apos;ll do .
no more vodka , no more caviar , no more Tchaikovsky , no more borscht !
- Wait a minute . I &apos;ve got a better idea . - What ?
you can tell the Kremlin that &apos;s just the beginning !
no visa .
march !
comrades of the world ... never has there been such a May Day parade as this .
- Good afternoon , Anna . - Good afternoon .
aren &apos;t you late ?
no .
the opera starts an hour later tonight on account of the parade .
- Didn &apos;t you march today ? - They didn &apos;t let me . I &apos;m in disgrace .
last week , at the performance of Carmen , I played a sour note .
the conductor got so excited , he yelled :
&quot; there is sabotage in the string section ! &quot;
too bad , Anna .
you missed an inspiring day .
Yes , I know .
are you expecting someone ?
- A few friends .
just a small dinner party . - And what are you serving ?
- An omelet . - An omelet ?
aren &apos;t you living a little above your ration ?
I saved two eggs ... and each of my friends is bringing his own .
just goes to prove the theory of our State .
if you stand alone , it means a boiled egg ... but if you &apos;re true to the collective spirit and stick together , you &apos;ve got an omelet .
that reminds me .
have you heard the latest they &apos;re telling about the Kremlin ?
well , one man ... I &apos;ll tell you later .
that Gurganov .
you never know whether he &apos;s on his way to the washroom , or the Secret Police .
- You should be more careful . - And you , too , Ninotchka .
- About what ?
- Ever since you &apos;ve been back from Paris ...
I haven &apos;t talked to anyone about Paris .
I haven &apos;t said a word .
that &apos;s just it .
it makes people feel queer .
and I don &apos;t want you to get in any trouble .
- I have nothing to hide . - You should . I &apos;ll show you .
when I passed through the laundry yard today ...
I saw all the women huddled around this , so I brought it up here .
things like this create a bad feeling .
first they didn &apos;t know whose it was ... and then they saw the Paris label and did it start a commotion .
some said it &apos;s what we all ought to wear .
others said it &apos;s like hanging foreign ideas on our clothesline .
- It undermines our whole cause . - I see .
you know how it is today .
all you have to do is wear ... a pair of silk stockings , and they suspect you of counter-revolution .
thank you , Anna .
I &apos;ll dry it up here when I wash it next .
I should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear .
Ninotchka , I &apos;m your friend . you can trust me .
- Did you bring back anything else ?
- No .
I left everything in Paris . I just happened to be wearing this .
tell me , what else did you have ?
well , a hat .
what was it like ?
Oh , it was very silly . I &apos;d be ashamed to wear it here .
as beautiful as that .
what else ?
come , tell me .
- An evening gown . - An evening gown ?
Yes , it &apos;s a dress you wear in the evening .
what do you wear in the morning ?
when you get up you wear a negligee , then you change into a morning frock .
you mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day ?
- Yes . - Now , Ninotchka , you are exaggerating .
no , it &apos;s true .
that &apos;s how they live in the other world .
here we dress to cover up our bodies .
to keep warm .
and there ?
sometimes they &apos;re not completely covered , but they don &apos;t freeze .
they must have wonderful materials to make a thing like this .
so soft .
- Something you don &apos;t even see . - You feel it , though .
Ninotchka , I wouldn &apos;t bring this up if we weren &apos;t such good friends .
what is it , Anna ?
you know I told you that Pavlov and I are going to get married ... when he comes back from the maneuvers .
would it be asking too much if ...
- You want this ? - Just for the honeymoon .
- It &apos;s yours for good . - Ninotchka .
thank you .
thank you very much .
I &apos;ll never forget what you &apos;ve done .
am I going to play that cadenza tonight !
... individuals , yes . as atoms in the cosmos of Soviet Russia .
... and 30 million peasants , 85 % of the population into an automobile and the muzhik into a tractor ... and then let the capitalists try to keep ...
no music .
Ninotchka .
Buljanoff , Iranoff , and Kopalski !
how are you , you three scoundrels ?
well , we are back home .
you know what they say , there is nothing like home .
Yes , and we might as well face it .
now , you mustn &apos;t talk that way , you must adjust yourselves .
- Let &apos;s be brave . - Brave , that &apos;s right .
- Come and sit down . - Let &apos;s be happy that we are all alive .
that we owe to Ninotchka .
if you hadn &apos;t given Commissar Razinin such a wonderful report about us ...
- who knows what would &apos;ve happened ? - I can tell you exactly .
let &apos;s forget everything , except we &apos;re together .
- Yes , let &apos;s do that . - It &apos;s a real Paris reunion .
if you close your eyes and listen to our voices , we might be in Paris .
let &apos;s not close our eyes . there are many good things to see here , too .
look how nicely she has arranged the table .
Yes , how lovely . and what a wonderful room you have here .
- How many families live here with you ? - Only myself and two other girls .
a cello player in the opera , and a streetcar conductor .
just three people in a room this size ?
Buljanoff , look here .
- Isn &apos;t that wonderful ?
- Look at this .
- What good material . - Naturally , it &apos;s not the Royal Suite .
comrades , once and for all , we are in Moscow .
Yes , there &apos;s no doubt of that . just look out of the window and there it is .
and it &apos;s great .
think what it was a few years ago and what it is now .
it &apos;s a tremendous achievement .
- You must be reasonable , comrades . - She is right .
anyhow , let &apos;s talk ourselves into it .
all right .
it &apos;s great . it &apos;s marvelous . it &apos;s wonderful .
just see how happy the people look from here .
can you blame them ?
at least the May Day parade is over .
that &apos;s another thing .
it &apos;s spring .
the same spring we had in Paris . just as good .
- Even the swallows are back . - Really ?
Yes , that &apos;s right .
maybe it &apos;s the same swallow we saw in Paris .
Yes , it is , Ninotchka . it is .
he must have been in Paris .
you can see it in his whole attitude .
he picked up a crumb of our black bread , shook his head and dropped it .
we must be patient . finally we got the spring , didn &apos;t we ?
let &apos;s forget the future . let &apos;s stop being sentimental .
- Let &apos;s start that omelet . - That &apos;s right .
- Here is my egg . - And here is mine .
and here are mine .
I don &apos;t know where &apos;s my egg ? I had an egg , too .
comrades , I am out of the omelet .
- Don &apos;t worry , there &apos;ll be enough . - Of course , comrade .
- Thank you . - Now come over here .
come , Ninotchka , let &apos;s make it in real Parisian style .
- Yeah . - Let &apos;s fill it with confiture des prunes .
a man like that .
all he has to do is walk through a room and the omelet drops .
Yes .
comrade Yakushova , here , the postman left this letter for you .
thank you , Vladimir .
- What is it , Ninotchka ? - Ninotchka , what is it ?
- It &apos;s from Paris . - From Paris ?
- A bill ?
- From Leon .
- From Leon ?
- How is he , tell us ?
bad news ?
well , I think it &apos;s getting late .
good night , Ninotchka .
thanks for a wonderful dinner .
- Good night , Ninotchka . - Good night .
good night .
they can &apos;t censor our memories , can they ?
no .
come in .
- Good morning , comrade . - Good morning , Comrade Commissar .
here &apos;s my report on materials available for trading in the next four months .
does it include products of the far eastern provinces ?
- Yes , it does . - You &apos;ve finished the whole investigation ?
that &apos;s marvelous .
you must have worked day and night .
- Don &apos;t you ever sleep ?
- I need very little sleep .
we must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange .
I have already started a survey on our most urgent needs .
comrade , I am afraid you will have to turn over that work to someone else .
may I ask why ?
- Please sit down . - Thank you .
now , comrade , have you heard from Kopalski , Buljanoff , and Iranoff ?
- No . - I haven &apos;t either ... but I have heard about them .
you must realize ... it was on the strength of your Paris report that I sent them to Constantinople .
without that , I never would have trusted them ... on a mission as important as a fur deal .
may I ask what has happened ?
if I told you what &apos;s going on in Constantinople right now ... you wouldn &apos;t believe it .
they are sitting there , those three , for six weeks ... and haven &apos;t sold a piece of fur .
this anonymous report was sent to me .
they are dragging the good name of our country through every cafe and nightclub .
here . &quot; how can the Bolshevik cause gain respect among the Moslems ...
&quot; if your three representatives , Buljanoff , Iranoff , and Kopalski get so drunk ...
&quot; that they throw a carpet out of their hotel window ...
&quot; and complain to the management that it didn &apos;t fly . &quot;
unbelievable !
it &apos;s an outrage .
they shouldn &apos;t do such things . are you sure this report &apos;s correct ?
naturally , I want to verify it , and that &apos;s why I need you .
- You want me to go to Constantinople ? - Yes , leaving immediately .
I appreciate your confidence in me ... but I must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission .
I should hate to interrupt my present work .
I am positive my survey is more important ... than finding out whether three of our comrades have been ... drinking some extra glasses of champagne .
that is for me to decide , Comrade Yakushova .
I am sorry .
I don &apos;t want to overstep my position ... but please don &apos;t send me .
please , comrade , let me stay here .
let me finish my work . I &apos;m in the rhythm of it now .
I don &apos;t want to go away .
I don &apos;t want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again .
it throws you out of gear .
let me finish my work .
I have concentrated everything in it .
please don &apos;t make me go .
don &apos;t waste my time , comrade .
do your duty . Goodbye .
I shall do my best .
how do you like it , Ninotchka ? isn &apos;t it wonderful ?
- Tell us , Ninotchka . - Buljanoff , Iranoff , Kopalski ...
now , please don &apos;t start figuring it out in cows .
you &apos;ve done it again , and I &apos;m responsible .
how can you forget yourselves this way ?
you were sent here to make money not to spend it .
Buljanoff , she still has those old-fashioned ideas .
- It is high time she got out of Russia . - Comrades .
- I must be stern with you . - That &apos;s our old Ninotchka .
don &apos;t forget the day will come when you will have to face Razinin .
Ninotchka !
Razinin ?
good old Razinin . is he still alive ? how does he manage ?
- Comrades ... - Friends , Ninotchka , we are friends .
imagine , we don &apos;t have to whisper any more .
no .
we can say whatever we want .
we can shout , we can complain .
look .
the service in this hotel is terrible !
see ?
nobody comes , nobody pays any attention .
- That &apos;s freedom . - That &apos;s bad management .
is it possible to bring you back to reality for one moment ?
I must have a complete report of your negotiations ...
- and a detailed expense account . - No , don &apos;t ask for it .
there is a Turkish proverb which says :
&quot; if something smells bad , why put your nose in it ? &quot;
and there is an old Russian saying :
&quot; the cat who has cream on his whiskers had better find good excuses . &quot;
with our cream situation as it is ... it &apos;s Russia that should apologize to the cats .
I don &apos;t know how I can get you out of it this time .
how will it end ?
- Shall we tell her ?
- Yes .
- Ninotchka , I hope you &apos;ll be our guest . - Guest ?
- Yes , we have opened a restaurant . - A restaurant ?
we have a wonderful electric sign :
&quot; dine with Buljanoff , Iranoff , and Kopalski . &quot;
you mean you &apos;re deserting Russia ?
Ninotchka , don &apos;t call it desertion .
our little restaurant , that is our Russia .
the Russia of borscht , the Russia of beef stroganoff .
- Of blinis and sour cream . - The Russia of pirozhki .
- People will eat and love it . - We are not only serving good food ... we are serving our country .
we are making friends .
who gave you this idea ? who &apos;s responsible for all this ?
there is something in Constantinople , something irresistible .
it &apos;s in the air . it may come around the corner ...
- when you walk down the street . - It may step out of a bazaar .
it may be waiting for you in a corridor . it may hide in the shadow of a minaret .
and right now it &apos;s on the balcony .
they wouldn &apos;t let me in , so I had to get you out .
so you &apos;re behind all this . I should have known .
trying to keep me away from you .
as though that were possible .
naturally , I couldn &apos;t go on forever punching passport officials in the nose ... but I found a way , didn &apos;t I ?
darling , I had to see you . I wrote and wrote .
and all my letters came back to me .
and the one I got , they wouldn &apos;t let me read .
it began , &quot; Ninotchka , my darling &quot; ... and it ended &quot; Yours , Leon . &quot;
I won &apos;t tell you what came between .
I &apos;ll show you , I &apos;ll prove it .
but it &apos;ll take a long time , Ninotchka .
at least a lifetime .
but , Leon , I &apos;m only here for a few days .
all right , if you don &apos;t stay with me , then I &apos;ll have to continue my fight .
I &apos;ll travel wherever there are Russian commissions .
I &apos;ll turn them all into Iranoffs , Buljanoffs , and Kopalskis .
the world will be crowded with Russian restaurants .
I &apos;ll depopulate Russia .
comrade , once you saved your country by going back .
this time you can only save it by staying here .
well , if it is a choice between my personal interest ... and the good of my country , how can I waver ?
no one shall say Ninotchka was a bad Russian .
darling .
call off your ungodly dogs !
down !
quiet ! down !
are you Mr. Heathcliff ?
well , I &apos;m Mr. Lockwood , your new tenant at the Grange .
I &apos;m lost . I--
can I get a guide from amongst your lads ?
no , you cannot . I &apos;ve only got one , and he &apos;s needed here .
well , then , I &apos;ll have to stay till morning .
do as you please .
quiet ! down !
thank you for your hospitality . could you extend it to a cup of tea ?
- Shall I ?
- You heard him ask for it .
thank you .
I presume the amiable lady is Mrs. Heathcliff ?
would it be taxing your remarkable hospitality if I sat down ?
I hope my hospitality will teach you ... not to make rash journeys on these moors .
as for staying here , I don &apos;t keep accommodations for visitors .
you can share a bed with one of the servants .
thanks . I &apos;ll sleep in a chair , sir .
no . a stranger is a stranger .
guests are so rare in this house that I hardly know how to receive them .
I and my dog .
Joseph , open up one of the upstairs rooms .
here &apos;s a room for thee , sir .
bridal chamber .
nobody slept here for years .
it &apos;s a trifle depressing .
- Can you light a fire ?
- No fire will burn in yonder grate .
Chimbley &apos;s all blocked up .
very well . thanks .
good night .
I said good night .
Heathcliff !
let me in !
I &apos;m lost on the moors !
- It &apos;s Cathy !
- Help ! Mr. Heathcliff !
there &apos;s somebody out !
Oh , Mr. Heathcliff !
there &apos;s someone out there . it &apos;s a woman . I heard her calling .
she said her name . Cathy . that was it !
Cathy ?
Oh , I must have been dreaming . forgive me .
get out of this room . get out !
get out , I tell you !
Cathy ! come in !
Cathy , come back to me .
Oh , do come once more .
Oh , my heart &apos;s darling !
Cathy . my own--
My--
where &apos;s he going in the storm ?
she calls him ... and he follows her out onto the moor .
he &apos;s mad ! he &apos;s like a madman .
he seized me by the collar and flung me out .
you see , I had a dream .
I thought I heard a voice calling .
I reached out to close the shutter , and something touched me .
something cold and clinging , like an icy hand .
and then I saw her . a woman .
then my senses must have become disordered because the falling snow ... shaped itself into what looked like a phantom , but there was nothing .
it was Cathy .
who is Cathy ?
a girl who died .
Oh , no , I don &apos;t believe in ghosts .
I don &apos;t believe in phantoms sobbing through the night .
- Poor Cathy .
- I don &apos;t believe life comes back ... once it &apos;s died and calls again to the living .
no , I don &apos;t .
maybe if I told you her story , you &apos;d change your mind ... about the dead coming back .
maybe you &apos;d know , as I do ... that there is a force that brings them back ... if their hearts were wild enough in life .
tell me her story .
it began 40 years ago ... when I was young ... in the service of Mr. Earnshaw ...
Cathy &apos;s father . Cathy &apos;s father .
Wuthering Heights was a lovely place in those days ... full of summertime and youth and happy voices .
one day Mr. Earnshaw was returning from a visit to Liverpool .
- You &apos;ll not catch me !
- Yes , I will !
Cathy , go wash ! I don &apos;t want your father to see you in that dress .
you too , Hindley . hurry up , now .
I don &apos;t want to get washed !
come along !
I &apos;ll tell your father not to give you the present he &apos;s bringing .
- What &apos;s he bringing ?
- Go along upstairs .
Joseph says his horse is coming over the hill .
evening , Mr. Earnshaw .
- Hello , Joseph .
- Hello , neighbor Earnshaw .
- How are you , Dr. Kenneth ?
- Back so soon ?
what in the world have you got there ?
a gift of God .
although it &apos;s as dark as if he came from the devil .
- Quiet , me bonny lad , we &apos;re home .
- He &apos;s a dour-looking individual .
Aye , and with reason .
I found him starving in Liverpool ... kicked and bruised and almost dead .
so you kidnapped him .
not until I spent two pounds trying to find out who its owner was .
but nobody would claim him , so I brought him home .
- Giddap !
- Here , here !
come on , you young imp of Satan . off with ye .
- Cathy , Hindley !
- Welcome home . the children are coming .
don &apos;t look so shocked , Ellen .
he &apos;s going to live with us for a while .
give him a good scrubbing ... and put some Christian clothes on him .
food is what he needs most , Mr. Earnshaw .
he &apos;s as thin as a sparrow . come into the kitchen , child .
Cathy ! Hindley !
- Father , what did you bring me ?
- Hello , Father !
there you are . it &apos;s what you &apos;ve always wanted .
a riding crop . be careful how you use it .
- Oh , it &apos;s wonderful !
- I &apos;m so glad you got back soon .
- It &apos;s wonderful ! - Ow !
father , make her stop !
no , children .
this is Hindley &apos;s violin .
one of the best in Liverpool .
here . fine tone .
and a bow to go with it .
here you are , Paganini .
who &apos;s that ?
- He was hungry as a wolf .
- Oh , children .
this is a little gentleman I met in Liverpool who will pay us a visit .
He-
- He &apos;s dirty .
Oh , no . don &apos;t make me ashamed of you , Cathy .
when he &apos;s been scrubbed , show him Hindley &apos;s room .
- He &apos;ll sleep there .
- In my room ?
he can &apos;t . I won &apos;t let him .
children , you may as well learn now that you must share what you have ... with others not as fortunate as yourselves .
- Take charge of the lad , Ellen .
- Come along , child .
what &apos;s your name ?
we &apos;ll call him Heathcliff .
Heathcliff , I &apos;ll race you to the barn .
the loser has to be the slave .
come on !
faster !
come on !
Whoa . I won !
you &apos;re my slave ! you have to do as I say . water my horse and groom it !
Oh , that &apos;s not fair ! it &apos;s too real .
- What do you want ?
- This horse .
- You can &apos;t have him . he &apos;s mine !
- Mine &apos;s lame . I &apos;m riding yours .
give him to me or I &apos;ll tell Father you boasted you &apos;d turn me out when he died !
that &apos;s a lie ! I never said such a thing .
- He didn &apos;t !
- You never had a father !
you gypsy beggar ! you can &apos;t have mine !
stop that !
- Heathcliff , look out !
- Don &apos;t come near me !
let him go ! you killed him !
I &apos;m going to tell Father . he &apos;ll punish you for this .
you can &apos;t go near him till he &apos;s well .
- You heard Dr. Kenneth !
- Are you hurt badly ?
talk to me .
why don &apos;t you cry ? Heathcliff , don &apos;t look like that !
how can I pay him back ?
I don &apos;t care how long I wait ... if I can only pay him back .
come . let &apos;s pick harebells on Penistone Crag .
you can ride Jane .
please , milord ?
- Oh , Heathcliff .
- Whoa , Jane .
- You &apos;re so handsome when you smile .
- Don &apos;t make fun of me .
don &apos;t you know that you &apos;re handsome ? do you know what I &apos;ve told Ellen ?
- You &apos;re a prince in disguise .
- You did ?
I said your father was the emperor of China and your mother an Indian queen .
it &apos;s true , Heathcliff .
you were kidnapped by wicked sailors and brought to England .
but I &apos;m glad . I &apos;ve always wanted to know somebody of noble birth .
all the princes I ever read about had castles .
of course . they captured them . you must capture one too .
there &apos;s a beautiful castle that lies waiting for your lance , Sir Prince .
you mean Penistone Crag ? Aw , that &apos;s just a rock .
if you can &apos;t see that &apos;s a castle , you &apos;ll never be a prince .
here , take your lance and charge !
see that black knight at the drawbridge ? challenge him !
charge !
I challenge you to mortal combat , Black Knight !
Heathcliff ! you &apos;ve killed him ! you &apos;ve killed the black knight !
he &apos;s earned it for all his wicked deeds .
Oh , it &apos;s a wonderful castle .
- Heathcliff , let &apos;s never leave it .
- Never in our lives !
let all the world confess , there is not a more beautiful damsel ... than the Princess Catherine of Yorkshire .
but I &apos;m still your slave .
no , Cathy . I now make you my queen .
whatever happens out there , here you will always be my queen .
how is he , Doctor ?
he is at peace .
send for the vicar , Joseph .
my dear , wild little Cathy .
you may come up and pray beside him now .
you &apos;re not wanted up there .
my father is past your wheedling .
go and help the stable boys harness the horse for the vicar .
do as you &apos;re told . I &apos;m master here now .
and as the children grew up , Hindley was indeed master of Wuthering Heights .
it was no longer the happy home of their childhood .
- Joseph , bring me another bottle .
- That &apos;s the third , Mr. Hindley .
the third or the twenty-third , bring me another .
wine is a mocker . strong drink is raging , Master Hindley .
stop spouting scripture and do as you &apos;re told , you croaking old parrot .
Yes , Master Hindley .
sit down , Cathy , till you &apos;re excused from the table .
Joseph , fill Miss Cathy &apos;s glass .
Oh , my little sister disapproves of drinking .
well , I know some people who don &apos;t .
Heathcliff , saddle my horse . be quick about it , you gypsy beggar .
I told you to be quick .
look at this stable . it &apos;s a pigsty .
is this the way you do your work ?
clean it up .
I want this floor cleaned and scrubbed tonight .
don &apos;t stand there showing your teeth . give me a hand up .
I want your work done when I come back at dawn , do you hear ?
Oh , you &apos;re hoping I won &apos;t come back .
you &apos;re hoping I &apos;ll fall and break my neck , aren &apos;t you ?
aren &apos;t you ?
well , come on , Heathcliff .
Heathcliff , where are you going ?
come back !
- Did Joseph see which way you came ?
- What does it matter ?
nothing &apos;s real down there . our life is here .
Yes , milord .
the clouds are lowering over Gimmerton Head .
see how the light is changing ?
it would be dreadful if Hindley ever found out .
found out what ?
that you talk to me once in a while ?
I shouldn &apos;t talk to you at all .
look at you ! you get worse every day .
dirty and unkempt and in rags .
why aren &apos;t you a man ?
Heathcliff , why don &apos;t you run away ?
run away ? from you ?
you could come back rich and take me away .
why aren &apos;t you my prince like we said long ago ?
- Why can &apos;t you rescue me ?
- Come with me now .
- Where ?
- Anywhere !
and live in haystacks and steal our food from the marketplaces ?
no . that &apos;s not what I want .
you just want to send me off . that won &apos;t do .
I &apos;ve stayed here and been beaten like a dog .
abused and cursed and driven mad , but I stayed just to be near you .
even as a dog ! I &apos;ll stay till the end .
I &apos;ll live and I &apos;ll die under this rock .
do you hear ?
music .
the Lintons are giving a party .
that &apos;s what I want .
dancing and singing in a pretty world .
and I &apos;m going to have it .
come on . let &apos;s go and see . come on !
isn &apos;t it wonderful ?
isn &apos;t she beautiful ? that &apos;s the kind of dress I &apos;ll wear .
you &apos;ll have a red velvet coat with silver buckles on your shoes .
Oh , will we ever ?
quick .
- Hold him , Skulker , Flash !
- Call off your dogs , you fools !
stay where you are . there &apos;s nothing to be alarmed about .
- Who is it ?
- I don &apos;t know .
please , back into the ballroom .
- Let me go !
- Hold that man .
hold onto him !
- Who is it Edgar ?
- Catherine Earnshaw , Father .
- Who &apos;s this with her ?
- Their stable boy .
she &apos;s bleeding . bring hot water , Isabella , and bandages .
- Yes . how badly is she hurt ?
- Can &apos;t tell .
send Robert to get Dr. Kenneth in the shay . hurry .
- You &apos;ll pay for this !
- Hold your tongue , insolent rascal !
- Get out of this house .
- I won &apos;t go without Cathy .
father , please , she &apos;s in pain .
go on . run away .
bring me back the world .
- Pack this fellow off .
- I &apos;m going .
I &apos;m going from here and from this cursed country both .
throw him out !
but I &apos;ll be back in this house one day , Judge Linton . I &apos;ll pay you out .
I &apos;ll bring this house down in ruins about your heads .
that &apos;s my curse on you !
on all of you !
and so Cathy found herself in this new world ... she had so often longed to enter .
after some happy weeks , Mr. Edgar brought her back to Wuthering Heights .
welcome home , Miss Cathy ! how do you do , Mr. Linton ?
don &apos;t stir ! I &apos;ll get Joseph to carry you .
carry her ? she runs like a little goat .
Ellen , I &apos;ve been dancing , night after night !
Oh , how beautiful you look !
wherever did you get that beautiful dress ?
Mr. Linton &apos;s sister lent it to me . isn &apos;t it wonderful ?
Edgar , do come in for tea .
as soon as the horses have been seen to .
I &apos;ll find someone .
is he here ?
he came back last week with great talk ... of lying in a lake of fire without you-- how he had to see you to live .
he &apos;s unbearable . where could he be , the scoundrel ?
why did you stay so long in that house ?
I didn &apos;t expect to find you here .
why did you stay so long ?
why ? because I was having a wonderful time .
a delightful , fascinating , wonderful time ... among human beings .
go and wash your face and hands , and comb your hair ... so that I needn &apos;t be ashamed of you in front of a guest .
what are you doing in this part of the house ?
look after Mr. Linton &apos;s horses .
let him look after his own .
- I &apos;ve already done so .
- Apologize to Mr. Linton at once .
bring in some tea , please .
- Cathy .
- Yes , Edgar ?
I cannot understand how your brother can allow that gypsy in the house .
don &apos;t talk about him .
how can you , a gentlewoman , tolerate him under your roof ?
a roadside beggar giving himself airs of equality . how can you ?
what do you know about Heathcliff ?
- All I need or want to know .
- He was my friend long before you .
- That blackguard ?
- Blackguard and all , he belongs here .
speak well of him or get out !
- Are you out of your senses ?
- Stop calling those I love names !
those you love ?
Cathy , what possesses you ? do you realize the things you &apos;re saying ?
I &apos;m saying that I hate you .
I hate the look of your milk-white face .
I hate the touch of your soft , foolish hands .
that gypsy &apos;s evil soul has got into you .
- Yes , it &apos;s true !
- That beggar &apos;s dirt is on you !
Yes ! now get out !
my dear .
leave me alone .
forgive me , Heathcliff .
make the world stop right here .
make everything stop and stand still and never move again .
make the moors never change and you and I never change .
the moors and I will never change .
- Don &apos;t you , Cathy .
- I can &apos;t .
no matter what I ever do or say , this is me now .
standing on this hill with you .
this is me forever .
come .
when you went away , what did you do ? where did you go ?
I went to Liverpool .
one night I shipped for America on a brigantine going to New Orleans .
we were held up by the tide , and I lay all night on the deck ... thinking of you and the years and years ahead without you .
I jumped overboard and swam ashore .
I think I &apos;d have died if you hadn &apos;t .
you &apos;re not thinking of that other world now .
smell the heather .
fill my arms with heather . all they can hold .
come on .
you &apos;re still my queen !
and as time went by ...
Cathy again was torn between her wild , uncontrollable passion for Heathcliff ... and the new life she had found at the Grange ... that she could not forget .
I got the soap in my eyes ! where &apos;s the towel ?
- Oh , it &apos;s hot !
- No , it &apos;s just--
- It &apos;s hot !
- Don &apos;t do that !
Ellen , haven &apos;t you finished yet ?
supposing you &apos;re not ready when he gets here . keep still .
any young man that will come sniveling back after the way you treated him ... you can keep waiting forever .
what &apos;s wrong with him , sending you perfume ? hasn &apos;t he any pride ?
I sent my apologies , didn &apos;t I ?
I can &apos;t believe this change in you , Miss Cathy .
yesterday you were a harum-scarum child with dirty hands and a willful heart .
look at you .
Oh , you &apos;re lovely , Miss Cathy . lovely .
that &apos;s a very silly lie .
I &apos;m not lovely . what I am is very brilliant .
- I have a wonderful brain .
- Indeed ?
it enables me to be superior to myself .
there &apos;s nothing to be gained by just looking pretty like Isabella .
every beauty mark must conceal a thought and every curl be full of humor ... as well as brilliantine .
as well as brilliantine .
such prattle . We--
since when are you in the habit of entering my room , Heathcliff ?
I want to talk to you . go outside , Ellen .
I will not !
I take orders from Mistress Catherine , not stable boys .
go outside .
all right , Ellen .
now that we &apos;re so happily alone , may I know to what I owe this great honor ?
- He &apos;s coming here again .
- You &apos;re utterly unbearable .
you didn &apos;t think so this morning on the moors .
- Well , my moods change indoors .
- Is he coming here ?
- Of course not . please go away .
- You &apos;re lying !
why are you dressed up in a silk dress ?
because gentlefolk dress for dinner .
not you . why are you trying to win his puling flatteries ?
I &apos;m not a child . you can &apos;t talk like that to me .
I &apos;m not talking to a child . I &apos;m talking to my Cathy .
- Oh , I &apos;m your Cathy ?
- Yes !
I &apos;m to take your orders and allow you to select my dresses ?
you &apos;re not gonna simper in front of him , listening to his silly talk !
I &apos;m not ?
well , I am . it &apos;s more entertaining that listening to a stable boy .
- Don &apos;t you talk like that .
- I will . go away .
this is my room , a lady &apos;s room , not a room for servants with dirty hands .
let me alone !
Yes .
tell the dirty stable boy to let go of you .
he soils your pretty dress .
but who soils your heart ? not Heathcliff !
who turns you into a vain , cheap , worldly fool ?
Linton does !
you &apos;ll never love him , but you &apos;ll let yourself be loved to please your vanity .
loved by that milksop with buckles on his shoes !
stop it and get out !
you had your chance to be something else .
but thief or servant were all you were born to be , or beggar beside a road .
not earning favors , but whimpering for them with your dirty hands !
that &apos;s all I &apos;ve become to you :
a pair of dirty hands .
well , have them then !
have them where they belong !
it doesn &apos;t help to strike you .
good evening , Ellen . I hope I &apos;m not too early .
- Miss Cathy will be down in a minute .
- Thanks .
if you &apos;ll go into the parlor , I &apos;ll tell Miss Cathy you &apos;re here .
half past eight . unholy hour .
doesn &apos;t he know , young fool , when it &apos;s time to go home ?
that &apos;s Mr. Edgar now .
go and fetch his horse .
- Take these apples into the larder .
- Yea , Lord .
spare the righteous and smite the ungodly .
stop your pratter .
- Good night , Joseph .
- Good night , sir .
has he gone ?
your hands ! what have you done ?
Linton . is he gone ?
what have you done to your hands ?
what have you been doing ?
I want to crawl to her feet , whimper to be forgiven ... for loving me , for needing her more than my own life ... for belonging to her more than my own soul .
don &apos;t let her see me .
I wondered whether you were still up . I have some news !
the kitchen is no place for that . come into the parlor .
come here . sit down . listen !
can you keep a secret ? Edgar &apos;s asked me to marry him .
- What did you tell him ?
- That I &apos;d give him my answer tomorrow .
do you love him , Miss Cathy ?
- Yes ! of course .
- Why ?
why ? that &apos;s a silly question , isn &apos;t it ?
no , not so silly . why do you love him ?
he &apos;s handsome and pleasant to be with .
- That &apos;s not enough .
- Because he &apos;ll be rich someday .
I &apos;ll be the finest lady in the county .
now tell me how you love him .
I love the ground under his feet , the air above his head ... and everything he touches .
what about Heathcliff ?
Oh , Heathcliff . he gets worse every day .
it would degrade me to marry him .
I wish he hadn &apos;t come back .
it would be heaven to escape from this disorderly , comfortless place .
well , if Master Edgar and his charms and money ...
well , if Master Edgar and his charms and money ... and parties mean heaven to you ... what &apos;s to keep you from taking your place among the Linton angels ?
I don &apos;t think I belong in heaven .
I dreamt once I was there .
I dreamt I went to heaven , and it didn &apos;t seem to be my home .
I broke my heart with weeping to come back to earth .
the angels were so angry , they flung me out in the middle of the heath ... on top of Wuthering Heights .
I woke up sobbing with joy .
that &apos;s it , Ellen !
I have no more business marrying Edgar than I have of being in heaven .
but Ellen , what can I do ?
you &apos;re thinking of Heathcliff .
who else ?
he &apos;s sunk so low . he seems to take pleasure in being brutal .
and yet ... he &apos;s more myself than I am .
whatever our souls are made of , his and mine are the same .
Linton &apos;s is as different as frost from fire .
my one thought in living is Heathcliff .
I am Heathcliff .
everything he &apos;s suffered , I &apos;ve suffered .
the little happiness he &apos;s ever known , I &apos;ve had too .
if everything died and Heathcliff remained ... life would still be full for me .
Hey , Heathcliff ! where &apos;s thee going ?
Heathcliff ! come back !
he must have been listening .
- Listening to us ?
- Yes .
where ?
how much did he hear ?
I &apos;m not sure , but I think ... to where you said it would degrade you to marry him .
there &apos;s no use in calling . he &apos;s run away on master &apos;s best horse .
come out of this storm ! you &apos;ll catch your death of cold !
- He won &apos;t come back !
- Last time he did !
this time he won &apos;t . I know him .
- Which way did he go , Joseph ?
- Yonder . right on west moor .
- Come in ! you must come in .
- The fool .
he should have known I love him . I love him !
Heathcliff , come back !
- Thank heaven you &apos;ve come home !
- I told Joseph to stay awake !
- Do I unsaddle my own horse ?
- You &apos;ve got to go out again !
Miss Cathy &apos;s gone ! they &apos;re looking for her-
- Joseph , everybody !
- Gone where ?
- Out in the storm , hours ago .
Heathcliff ran away . he took a horse , and she went running after him .
- Oh , she did ?
- Yes .
don &apos;t stand there with your mouth open .
fetch me a bottle and we &apos;ll celebrate .
master Hindley , she &apos;ll die on the moors .
- You &apos;ve got to help .
- Do as I tell you !
if she &apos;s gone off with that gypsy scum , let her run .
let her run through storm and hell . they &apos;re birds of a feather .
the devil can take them both . get me a bottle .
- Take her into the library .
- Get a fire in the east room .
and some brandy .
turn this around to the fire .
- The brandy , Miss Isabella .
- Get some dry towels . quickly .
- Where was she ?
- The rocks on Penistone Crag ... the life almost out of her .
Twenty drops in a glass of claret , well warmed .
then add a lump of sugar .
there &apos;s nothing else I can tell you ... except keep her in the sun and give her plenty of cream and butter .
in another month you &apos;ll be feeling like new .
- Good-bye , dear .
- Good-bye , Dr. Kenneth .
she &apos;ll be going home soon , Doctor .
what &apos;s needed is peace and orderliness in her life .
that &apos;s not to be found at Wuthering Heights .
- Has she mentioned him at all ?
- Not since the delirium passed .
sometimes fever can heal as well as destroy .
I made some inquiries in the village of the people who knew him .
- What did you hear ?
- No sign nor hint of Heathcliff .
- He &apos;s disappeared into thin air .
- Heaven hope .
&quot; ... days and yon pursuits . &quot;
- Hello , Edgar .
- Isabella . how &apos;s our invalid ?
- Much better I think .
- Let me have a look at her .
where have you been all day ? I &apos;ve missed you .
Oh , this time of year every tenant has something to complain about .
I &apos;ve been arguing with old Swithin ... whether we &apos;d build him a new pigsty .
Yes ?
he decided we should .
I saw Hindley in the village this afternoon .
he wanted to know when you &apos;ll be coming home .
I wasn &apos;t very truthful . I told him Dr. Kenneth said it would be months .
give me that . it &apos;s time for her medicine .
what did Dr. Kenneth say ?
Twenty lumps of sugar in a glass-- No .
I &apos;ll go and ask Ellen .
Yes . go and ask Ellen .
she &apos;s such a darling .
but you &apos;ve all been so nice to me .
that &apos;s all I think about , how nice you are to me .
but still , I can &apos;t stay here forever .
why not , Cathy ... if I can make you happy ?
you have made me happy , Edgar .
you &apos;ve given me so much of your own self , your strength .
darling , let me take care of you forever .
let me guard you and love you always .
would you love me always ?
Yes .
it &apos;s so easy to love you .
because I &apos;m no longer wild and blackhearted and full of gypsy ways ?
- No . I--
- Of course you were right , Edgar .
what you said long ago was true .
there was a strange curse on me .
something that kept me from being myself .
or at least from being what I wanted to be-- living in heaven .
how sweet you are .
I &apos;ve never kissed you .
no one will ever kiss me again but you .
no one .
I &apos;ll be your wife and be proud of being your wife .
I &apos;ll be good to you and love you truly , always .
white heather for good luck , Miss Catherine .
come along , Cathy .
what is it ?
a cold wind went across my heart just then-- a feeling of doom .
you touched me , and it was gone .
Oh , it &apos;s nothing , darling , I &apos;m sure .
Oh , Edgar , I love you . I do .
Good-bye .
and I , too , felt a cold wind across my heart as they rode away together .
but as the years went on , they were really in possession ... of a deep and growing happiness .
I wish you could &apos;ve seen Miss Cathy then .
she became quite the lady of the manor and was almost overfond of Mr. Linton .
for Isabella , she showed great affection ... and presided over Thrushcross Grange ... with quiet dignity .
it looks as though you &apos;ve fallen into a trap , Father .
Yes , it does , doesn &apos;t it ?
there you are .
Checkmate .
- Thank you , Father .
- Well , I &apos;ll go and dress for dinner .
what &apos;s wrong with the dogs ?
probably a servant coming back from the village .
I talked to Jeff Peters this afternoon about that new wing of ours .
it doesn &apos;t look as though we &apos;ll marry Isabella off for another decade .
it &apos;s a brother &apos;s duty to introduce your sister to some other type ... than fops and pale young poets .
- You want a dragoon ?
- Yes , I do . with a fiery mustache .
poor Isabella . I &apos;m afraid I got the only prize in the county .
thank you , darling .
for me , heaven is bounded ... by the four walls of this room .
Yes , we &apos;re all angels , even my little petit point hero .
I &apos;m just putting wings on him .
speaking of wings , I &apos;ll show you those plans .
- Miss Cathy ?
- What is it ?
someone wishes to see you .
- You sound as if it were a ghost .
- It is . he &apos;s come back .
who ?
- What does he want ?
- He wants to see you .
tell him-
- Tell him I &apos;m not at home .
not at home , Cathy ? to whom are you not at home ?
it &apos;s Heathcliff .
seems he &apos;s come back .
well , that &apos;s news . where has he been ?
America , he said . he &apos;s so changed I hardly recognized him .
- For the better , I hope .
- Oh , yes . he &apos;s quite the gentlemen .
- Fine clothes , a horse .
- Go tell him I don &apos;t wish to see him .
Oh , nonsense , Cathy . we can &apos;t be as cruel as that .
he &apos;s come a long way , and he &apos;s a fine gentleman , so Ellen says .
let &apos;s see how America &apos;s managed to make a silk purse out of Master Heathcliff .
- Show him in .
- Yes , Master Edgar .
it &apos;s chilly .
why be nervous ? the past is dead .
it &apos;s nonsense to tremble before a little ghost who returns-- a dead leaf blowing around your feet .
darling ... you may smile at him without fear of offending me .
it &apos;s my wife who smiles-- my wife who loves me .
Yes .
I was silly .
thank you , Edgar .
well , Heathcliff .
- Mr. Linton .
- How are you ?
Hello , Cathy .
- I remember this room .
- Come in . sit by the fire .
have a whiskey ?
no , thank you .
I &apos;ve never seen such a change in a man .
I wouldn &apos;t have known you .
you seem to have prospered since our last meeting .
somewhat .
Ellen said you &apos;d been to America .
Yes .
we all wondered where you went .
have you met my sister , Miss Linton ?
what brought about this amazing transformation ?
did you discover a gold mine in the New World ... or inherit a fortune ?
the truth is , I remembered that my father was an emperor of China ... and my mother was an Indian queen ... and I went out and claimed my inheritance .
it all turned out just as you once suspected , Cathy ... that I had been kidnapped by wicked sailors and brought to England .
that I was of noble birth .
are you visiting here long ?
I mean , in the village ?
the rest of my life .
I &apos;ve just bought Wuthering Heights-- the house , the stock and the moors .
Hindley has sold you the estate ?
he &apos;s not aware of it as yet .
I &apos;m afraid it &apos;ll be somewhat of a surprise when he finds ... his gambling debts and liquor bills paid off by his former stable boy .
perhaps he will merely laugh at the irony of it .
I don &apos;t understand how this could &apos;ve happened ... without Mrs. Linton hearing of it .
modesty compelled me to play the Good Samaritan in secret .
by heaven . this is the most underhanded piece of work I &apos;ve ever heard of .
if I &apos;d only known .
I knew Hindley had financial difficulties ... but not that his property was being stolen from him by a stranger .
I &apos;m neither thief nor stranger .
merely your neighbor , sir .
- Now I &apos;ll say good night .
- Wait , Heathcliff .
Edgar and I have many neighbors whom we receive with hospitality and friendship .
if you are to be one of them , you &apos;re welcome to visit our house ... but not with a scowl on your face or an old bitterness in your heart .
thank you .
it occurs to me that I have not congratulated you on your marriage .
I &apos;ve often thought of it .
allow me to express my delight over your happiness now .
good night .
- I think you behaved abominably .
- What ?
you , too , Cathy . I &apos;m dreadfully disappointed in both of you .
- What are you talking about ?
- You could have been civil to him .
I conducted myself perfectly , and so did Cathy .
- You dismissed him like a servant .
- And you thought him otherwise ?
- I thought him distinguished .
- I hope I misunderstood you .
it &apos;s impossible my sister could think of Heathcliff ... as anything but a surly , dressed-up beggar , a lout and a boor .
I shall make sure that you never see him again .
now go to dinner .
Joseph .
Yes , Master Hindley ?
- Where &apos;s the key ?
- Is it in the door ?
no , and I want it .
he &apos;s left , and it &apos;s our chance .
I &apos;ll lock him out this time .
if he tries to get in , I &apos;ll kill him .
find that key , and bring me a bottle of wine .
- You &apos;ve had a bad night .
- A bad night , you call it ?
how can I stay sober with that vulture &apos;s beak inside me ?
he stabbed me in the dark . he robbed me of my home and gold .
- Where &apos;s the wine ?
- Dr. Kenneth has forbid it .
- Blast Dr. Kenneth !
- Get him what he wants .
Dr. Kenneth has forbid it .
what difference to the world whether he &apos;s drunk or sober ?
or to Dr. Kenneth ? do as I tell you .
get out .
it &apos;s too early in the morning to look on the devil .
your ingratitude makes me almost sad .
all I have done to you is to enable you to be yourself .
my money has helped you drink and gamble and enjoy the world as you wished .
now that you &apos;re without a home I remember that you gave me ... a place to sleep when you might &apos;ve turned me out .
I allow you to remain ... and even provide you with solace ... against the doctor &apos;s orders .
I &apos;ll have Wuthering Heights back .
I &apos;ll be master here , and I &apos;ll turn you out as I should have done years ago .
we &apos;re just in time , Joseph .
Mr. Hindley is beginning to whine and stutter .
he needs fire in his veins-- a little courage with which to face his unhappy life .
I &apos;ll have my gold , and I &apos;ll have your blood , and hell can have your soul !
laugh now , Heathcliff .
there &apos;s no laughter in hell .
all you have to do is to shoot .
they &apos;ll thank me for it .
the world will say I did right ridding it of a rotten gypsy beggar !
Yes ! they &apos;ll say that .
shoot , and you &apos;ll be master here again .
the whole county will resound with your courage .
go on , shoot , you puling chicken of a man ... with not enough blood in you to keep your hand steady !
you remember that time you hit me with a rock ?
the times you shamed and flogged me as your stable boy ?
you were a coward then , and you &apos;re a coward now .
take him out . find someplace for him to sleep .
Aye . I &apos;ll put him to bed .
not in the master &apos;s room .
I &apos;m master here now .
- His pistol .
- Aye . I &apos;ll hide it .
a gentleman must not be deprived of his weapons .
I prefer that he have it by him always as a reminder of his cowardice .
- Master Heathcliff .
- What is it ?
- A lady to see you .
- A lady ? from where ?
the Grange , sir .
the Grange ? why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
out of my way .
I hope I &apos;m not disturbing you .
not at all .
I was riding behind the Heights on the moors , and my horse went lame .
- And you brought him here .
- Yes .
that was very wise .
shall we look at the animal ?
that isn &apos;t necessary . I &apos;ve put him in the stables .
he &apos;s being taken care of .
I see .
won &apos;t you come in ?
get on with your work .
I was furious with my brother , and Cathy too . I told them so .
I thought they acted most shamefully .
let me give you a chair .
your brother didn &apos;t send you with these apologies ?
Oh , no . he &apos;s forbidden me to--
to speak to me ?
Yes .
and Mrs. Linton ?
she &apos;s also very angry with you .
so in all the county you are my only friend .
I would like to be .
well , let us celebrate our new friendship by a gallop over the moors .
Oh , but my horse is lame .
my dear , your horse is not lame , and it never was .
you came to see me because you are lonely ... because it is lonely sitting like an outsider ... in so happy a house as your brother &apos;s--
lonely riding on the moors with no one at your side .
you won &apos;t be lonely anymore .
good evening , sir .
good evening , Ellen .
I was afraid you wouldn &apos;t come .
tonight would &apos;ve been ruined if you hadn &apos;t .
good heavens . is that Heathcliff ?
Yes , it is .
I can &apos;t believe it . Cathy having him here--
not Cathy . it &apos;s my sister .
it &apos;s just a young girl &apos;s fancy , but one must not inflame it ... with too much opposition , but let it spend itself harmlessly in a few dances .
madam Eilers is going to play the harpsichord . come and sit down .
I shall let you hold my hand underneath my fan .
thank you very much .
Oh , it &apos;s a waltz . Heathcliff , will you ?
you see , we can hold each other , and no one can object ... because that &apos;s the way it &apos;s danced .
that &apos;s the way gypsies dance .
I &apos;m surprised to see such abandoned ways creep into so fine a house .
father used to say it &apos;d undermine the whole of society ... and turn us into profligates .
- May I have the pleasure ?
- Thank you , but I don &apos;t think I can .
nonsense . let me see you waltz .
- Will you watch me ?
- Of course .
I &apos;m ready .
you &apos;re not dancing this dance .
thank you . I &apos;m nearly exhausted .
will the moonlight and a breath of air refresh you ?
always .
excuse me , please .
are you enjoying yourself , Heathcliff ?
I &apos;ve had the pleasure of watching you .
you &apos;re very grand , Heathcliff . so handsome .
looking at you tonight I could not help but remember how things used to be .
they used to be better .
don &apos;t pretend life hasn &apos;t improved for you .
life has ended for me .
how can you stand here beside me and pretend not to remember ?
not to know that my heart is breaking for you ?
that your face is the wonderful light burning in all this darkness ?
Heathcliff , no . I forbid it .
you forbid what your heart says ?
- It &apos;s saying nothing .
- I can hear it louder than the music .
Oh , Cathy .
I &apos;m not the Cathy that was . can &apos;t you understand ?
I &apos;m somebody else .
I &apos;m another man &apos;s wife , and he loves me . and I love him .
if he loved you with all his soul for a lifetime ... he couldn &apos;t love you as much as I do in a single day .
not he . not the world .
not even you , Cathy , can come between us .
you must go away . you must leave this house and never come back .
I never want to see your face again as long as I live .
you lie .
why do you think I &apos;m here tonight ?
because you willed it . you willed me here across the sea .
Cathy , have you seen Heathcliff ? Oh , there you are .
they &apos;re going to play a schottische . come along .
it &apos;s quite suitable to your high moral character .
what &apos;s the matter ? has Cathy been behaving horribly again ?
if she weren &apos;t my sister-in-law , I &apos;d say she was jealous .
come along .
come in .
- I want to talk to you .
- What about , Cathy ?
- About Heathcliff .
- It &apos;s very late .
I have no desire to discuss Heathcliff with you anyway .
- You behaved disgracefully tonight .
- In what way ?
it was bad enough your asking him here , but to make a spectacle of yourself .
Catherine , be careful of what you say .
you fool . you vain little fool .
I &apos;ll not be silent any longer . I &apos;m going to tell the truth .
- Let me go .
- Not till I open your eyes .
my eyes are quite open , thank you .
don &apos;t you see what he &apos;s doing ?
he &apos;s using you to be near me ... to smile at me behind your back ... to try to rouse something in my heart that &apos;s dead .
I &apos;ll not have it . I &apos;ll not allow you to help him .
it &apos;s you who are vain and insufferable .
- Heathcliff loves me .
- It &apos;s a lie .
it &apos;s not a lie . he &apos;s told me so . he &apos;s kissed me .
he &apos;s held me in his arms . he &apos;s told me that he loves me .
- I &apos;m going to your brother . - Go !
he &apos;s asked me to marry him .
we &apos;re going to be married .
Heathcliff &apos;s going to be my husband .
you can &apos;t .
Heathcliff &apos;s not a man ... but something dark and horrible to live with .
do you imagine that I don &apos;t know why you &apos;re acting so ?
because you love him .
Yes ! you love him !
and you &apos;re mad with pain at the thought of my marrying him .
you want him to pine and dream of you ... die for you , while you live in comfort as Mrs. Linton .
you don &apos;t want him to be happy .
you want to make him suffer . you want to destroy him !
but I want to make him happy , and I will !
I heard your voices .
we were just discussing the ball .
there &apos;s plenty of time for gossip tomorrow .
you ought to come to bed , darling . you look tired .
good night .
- Good morning , Joseph .
- Mistress Cathy , I mean .
Mr. Hindley &apos;s away .
it &apos;s Mr. Heathcliff I wish to see .
Oh .
I &apos;ll try and find him .
leave us , Joseph .
what brings you to Wuthering Heights ?
does Edgar know ? I doubt he &apos;d approve .
Heathcliff , is it true ?
- Is what true ?
- That you asked Isabella to marry you .
it is true then . Oh , Heathcliff , you must not do this .
she hasn &apos;t harmed you .
- You have .
- Then punish me !
I &apos;m going to , when I take her in my arms-- when I promise her life and happiness .
if there &apos;s anything human left in you , don &apos;t do this .
don &apos;t make me a partner to such a crime .
it &apos;s stupid . it &apos;s mad .
if you ever looked at me with what is in you , I &apos;d be your slave .
if your heart were stronger than your fear of God and the world ...
I would live silently contented in your shadow .
but no .
you must destroy us both with that weakness you call virtue .
you must keep me tormented with that cruelty you think so pious .
you &apos;ve been smug and pleased with my vile love of you , haven &apos;t you ?
after this , you won &apos;t think of me as Cathy &apos;s foolish and despairing lover .
you &apos;ll think of me as Isabella &apos;s husband ... and be glad for my happiness ... as I was for yours .
- Drive to the village . get Mr. Linton .
- Very well , ma &apos;am .
marry ? it &apos;s preposterous . Isabella and Heathcliff ?
it &apos;s true . what will you do about it ?
do ? I &apos;ll put her under lock and key if need be .
- We must go after them .
- Going after them is useless .
we must go after them while there &apos;s still time .
they mustn &apos;t marry .
don &apos;t disturb yourself . there &apos;s nothing I can do .
but you must , Edgar . get your pistols .
go after them . kill him !
but stop them from marrying .
this marriage cannot be , do you hear ? it must--
and so Heathcliff and Isabella were married .
many months later at Wuthering Heights ... during one of Dr. Kenneth &apos;s increasingly rare visits--
why don &apos;t you hit yourself over the head with a hammer ... the instant you get up in the morning ?
- Why ?
- If you hit yourself hard enough ... you &apos;ll remain unconscious the whole day and achieve the same results ... you would from a whole gallon of spirits ... with much less wear and tear on the kidneys .
don &apos;t you agree with me , Mrs. Heathcliff ?
what does it matter ?
well , I &apos;d hoped that it did matter ... that when you came here , things would change .
only I changed .
I remember this house when it rang with laughter and love . Good-bye .
ask your husband to call another doctor in future .
whoever dwells in this house is beyond my healing arts .
I shall miss you , Dr. Kenneth .
I brought you into the world ... but it &apos;s a world you &apos;re not going to grace very long if you stay here .
dear child , I must tell you this .
go back where you belong , back with Edgar for a month or two .
it would mean your salvation , and his .
Edgar &apos;s disowned me .
nonsense . that was natural under the circumstances , but he needs you now .
he does . why ?
Cathy is gravely ill .
in fact , it &apos;s only a matter of days .
hours , perhaps .
what is it ?
fever . Inflammation of the lungs .
but there &apos;s something beyond that .
I don &apos;t know . I &apos;d call it a will to die .
if Cathy died ...
I might begin to live .
begin to live , eh ?
in this house with Heathcliff , nothing can live .
nothing but hate . it &apos;s breathing like the devil &apos;s own breath on me .
and you , he hates you worse than he does me . he loathes you .
each time you kiss him his heart breaks with rage because it &apos;s not Cathy .
- Kill him .
- I forbade you to speak about him .
- Stop it , you hear me ?
- Kill him !
that &apos;s the first lucid talk I &apos;ve heard out of Hindley for weeks .
it &apos;s not very Christian talk , but it &apos;s coherent .
seemed to make some points .
- I &apos;m delighted with your improvement .
- I tried to stop him .
thank you , my dear wife . your loyalty is touching .
your curses will come home to feed on your own heart .
every agony you &apos;ve given will return .
why do we have him here ?
I can &apos;t breathe with him in the house .
existence would be so much less without my boyhood friend under my roof .
don &apos;t you see ?
you poison yourself with hating him .
darling , please send him away and let love come into the house .
why isn &apos;t there the smell of heather in your hair ?
why won &apos;t you let me come near you ?
you &apos;re not black and horrible as they all think . you &apos;re full of pain .
I can make you happy . let me try .
you won &apos;t regret it . I &apos;ll be your slave .
I can bring life back to you , new and fresh .
why are your eyes always empty ... like Linton &apos;s eyes ?
they &apos;re not empty .
if you &apos;d only look deeper .
look at me .
I &apos;m pretty .
I &apos;m a woman , and I love you .
you &apos;re all of life to me .
let me be a single breath of it for you .
Heathcliff , let your heart look at me just once .
Oh , why did God give me life ?
what is it but hunger and pain ?
what do you want , Ellen ?
what are you doing here ?
I want to speak to Miss Isabella .
you can do so in front of me .
her brother has asked me to bring her home for a visit .
he needs you with him , Miss Isabella .
why ?
let go of me , Heathcliff .
Cathy . she &apos;s ill .
Yes .
Mr. Edgar wants you to come home at once , Miss Isabella .
she &apos;s dying .
you &apos;re not going . she belongs to Edgar if she &apos;s dying .
let her die where she belongs , in Edgar &apos;s arms .
let her die .
is that better ?
Yes .
isn &apos;t there a south wind ?
isn &apos;t the snow almost gone ?
quite gone down here , darling . just a few patches left .
the sky is blue , and the larks are singing ... and the brooks are brimming full .
will you get me something ?
- What do you want , darling ?
- Some heather .
there &apos;s a beautiful patch near the castle .
I want some from there .
near the castle ? what castle , darling ?
the castle on the moors , Edgar .
go there , please .
there &apos;s no castle on the moors , darling .
there is .
it &apos;s on the hill ... beyond Wuthering Heights .
- You mean Penistone Crag .
- Yes .
I was a queen there once .
go there , Edgar .
get me some heather , please .
I &apos;ll go .
you sleep while I &apos;m gone , and rest so you &apos;ll be better tomorrow .
you &apos;ve been very dear to me , Edgar .
- Very dear .
- Sleep , darling .
Robert !
get my horse ready . I &apos;m going to Dr. Kenneth . be quick .
Yes , sir .
come here .
I was dreaming ... you might come before I died .
you might come and scowl at me once more .
Oh , Heathcliff ... how strong you look .
how many years do you mean to live after I &apos;m gone ?
don &apos;t--
don &apos;t let me go .
if I could only hold you till we were both dead .
will you forget me when I &apos;m in the earth ?
I could as soon forget you as my own life .
Cathy , if you die--
poor Heathcliff . come .
let me feel how strong you are .
strong enough to bring us both back to life , Cathy , if you want to live .
no , Heathcliff . I want to die .
Oh , Cathy .
why did you kill yourself ?
hold me .
just hold me .
no , I &apos;ll not comfort you .
my tears don &apos;t love you , Cathy .
they blight and curse and damn you .
Heathcliff , don &apos;t break my heart .
Oh , Cathy , I never broke your heart . you broke it .
you loved me !
what right to throw love away for the poor fancy thing you felt for him ?
for a handful of worldliness ?
misery , death and all the evils God and man could &apos;ve handed down ... would never have parted us .
you did that alone .
you wandered off ... like a wanton , greedy child ... to break your heart and mine .
Heathcliff , forgive me .
we have so little time .
Oh , Cathy .
Cathy , your wasted hands .
kiss me again .
Heathcliff , he &apos;s coming .
Mr. Linton . for heaven &apos;s sake , go ! only be quick !
it &apos;s the last time .
I won &apos;t go , Cathy . I &apos;m here .
I &apos;ll never leave you again .
I told you , Ellen , when he went away , that night in the rain--
I told you I belonged to him , that he was my life , my being .
don &apos;t listen to her ravings .
it &apos;s true .
I &apos;m yours , Heathcliff . I &apos;ve never been anyone else &apos;s .
she doesn &apos;t know what she &apos;s saying .
you can still get out . go before they get here .
take me to the window .
let me look at the moors with you once more .
my darling . once more .
how beautiful the day is .
can you see the crag ... over there where our castle is ?
I &apos;ll wait for you ... till you come .
leave her alone .
she &apos;s mine .
she &apos;s mine now .
Miss Cathy .
Oh , my wild heart .
Miss Cathy .
she &apos;s gone .
you &apos;ve done your last black deed , Heathcliff .
leave this house .
she &apos;s at peace , in heaven and beyond us .
what do they know of heaven or hell , Cathy ... who know nothing of life ?
Oh , they &apos;re praying for you , Cathy .
I &apos;ll pray one prayer with them .
I repeat till my tongue stiffens :
Catherine Earnshaw , may you not rest so long as I live on .
I killed you .
haunt me , then . haunt your murderer .
I know that ghosts have wandered
be with me always .
take any form . drive me mad .
only do not leave me in this dark alone , where I cannot find you .
I cannot live without my life .
I cannot die without my soul .
Oh , Cathy .
Oh , my dear .
I can still see and hear that wild hour ...
I can still see and hear that wild hour ... with poor Heathcliff trying to tear away the veil between death and life ... crying out to Cathy &apos;s soul ... to haunt him and torment him ... till he died .
you say that was Cathy &apos;s ghost I heard at the window ?
not her ghost ... but Cathy &apos;s love , stronger than time itself ... still sobbing for its unlived days ... and uneaten bread .
- What &apos;s the matter , man ?
- I &apos;ve gone mad .
- Stark raving mad .
- Dr. Kenneth .
I saw Heathcliff out in the moors in the snow with a woman .
- A woman , you say ?
- Yes , a woman .
I saw her with him plain as my own eyes .
it was Cathy .
go on , man . what happened ?
no , I don &apos;t know who it was .
I was trying to get up near to them ... when suddenly my horse reared and plunged , and I was thrown .
I called out to them , but they didn &apos;t hear me , so I followed them .
I tell you I saw them both !
he had his arm about her .
so I climbed up after them ... and I found him .
only him-- alone-- with only his footprints in the snow .
under a high rock on a ledge near Penistone Crag .
Yes .
was he dead ?
no , not dead , Dr. Kenneth .
not alone .
he &apos;s with her .
they &apos;ve only just begun to live .
Good-bye , Heathcliff .
Good-bye , my wild , sweet Cathy .
- What &apos;s new ? - Same old daily bunkeroo .
Mr. Powers says he wants to see that foreign stuff as soon as it comes in .
don &apos;t declare war for a few minutes .
&quot; according to a high official , it is believed ... &quot;
bah !
foreign correspondent !
I could get more news out of Europe looking in a crystal ball .
that , uh , Stebbins cable has a morsel in it .
Stebbins makes me sick . they all make me sick .
Europe about to blow up , and all I can get out of my foreign staff ... is a daily guessing game .
- I want some facts , Mr. Bradley ! - For instance ?
any kind of facts .
there must be something going on in Europe beside a nervous breakdown . why not try sending me over , Mr. Powers ?
you &apos;ve written a book on economics or something ...
the Twilight of Feudalism . Yes .
it was very well received . I don &apos;t want any more economists ... sages or oracles bombinating over our cables .
I want a reporter , somebody who doesn &apos;t know the difference ... between an &quot; ism &quot; and a kangaroo .
a good , honest crime reporter ... that &apos;s what the Globe needs .
that &apos;s what Europe needs .
there &apos;s a crime hatching on that bedeviled continent .
wait a minute .
I &apos;ve got something that might pass for an idea .
who was that fellow that ran down the payroll robbery last week ?
Oh , you mean Johnny Jones .
he beat up a policeman , didn &apos;t he , in the line of duty ?
Yes , there &apos;s talk at the City desk of firing him . Hmm .
beat up a policeman , eh ?
sounds ideal for Europe . send Mr. Jones up here right away .
Mr. Powers wants to see you , Mr. Jones .
- He does , huh ?
- You should come right away .
- What about ?
- I ain &apos;t in his confidence .
tell him to save his breath . tell him I &apos;ve resigned .
- I &apos;m supposed to bring you there .
- Okay .
wait till I open this .
where &apos;s Mr. Jones ?
I told you to send him right up here !
- Are you Mr. Jones ? - Yes .
sit down , please .
you mind a personal question ? - No .
- Are you married ?
- No luck .
- Single , eh ? - Ever been in Europe ?
- No .
what &apos;s your opinion of the present European crisis , Mr. Jones ? what crisis ?
I &apos;m referring to the impending war .
Oh , that .
to tell you the truth , Mr. Powers , I haven &apos;t given it much thought .
you don &apos;t keep up with our foreign news , do you ?
Mr. Powers , if you &apos;re gonna fire me , you can scrap the intelligence test . it &apos;s okay with me .
I can get a job on any other newspaper in town . - So long . - Wait a minute .
- Nobody fired you .
- Huh ?
how would you like to cover the biggest story in the world today ?
give me an expense account , and I &apos;ll cover anything .
I &apos;ll give you an expense account .
- Okay , what &apos;s the story ? - Europe .
I &apos;m not exactly equipped , but I could do some reading up .
no , I like you just as you are .
what Europe needs is a fresh , unused mind . - Foreign correspondent , huh ?
- No .
reporter .
I don &apos;t want correspondence . I want news .
think you could dig up some news in Europe ? - I &apos;d be very happy to try , sir .
- This is what I mean .
Mr. Van Meer , when questioned by our oracle , Mr. Stebbins ... refused to open his mouth .
Twelve hundred words cable-tolled to the fact that ... the great Van Meer had nothing to say .
you know what that stuff is doing ?
driving our readers crazy with frustration . who &apos;s Van Meer ?
Keynote to the European situation today .
if Van Meer stays at the helm ... of his country &apos;s affairs for the next three months ... it may mean peace in Europe .
if we knew what he was thinking , we &apos;d know where Europe stands .
- A German , huh ? - No .
Holland &apos;s strongman . one of two signers of the Dutch treaty with the Belgians .
now , this is your first assignment .
talk with him , find out what &apos;s in that treaty ... and what he thinks is going to happen ... facts .
- Van Meer , huh ? - Right .
- Anybody else ?
how about Hitler ?
don &apos;t you think it &apos;d be good to pump him ?
he must have something on his mind .
Yes ?
Mr. Stephen Fisher to see you , Mr. Powers .
tell him to come in .
did you ever hear of Stephen Fisher ?
- I &apos;m afraid he &apos;s not on my beat .
- He is from now on .
he &apos;s head of the Universal Peace Party , and very close to Van Meer .
they &apos;re both working to prevent Europe going up in flames .
Oh .
- How do you do , Mr. Fisher ? - How are you ? - Nice of you to come over .
Mr. Fisher , Mr. Jones , our new foreign correspondent .
- I want you to know each other .
- How do you do ?
&quot; Jones &quot; ...
I don &apos;t like that name . it &apos;s going to handicap you , young man .
now , wait a minute .
I &apos;ve got some sort of a name here .
Yes . &quot; Haverstock . &quot; &quot; Huntley Haverstock . &quot;
- Sounds more important , don &apos;t you think ?
very dashing too . it sounds better than Richard Harding Davis .
what &apos;s the matter with that ?
we can &apos;t use that .
that &apos;s the name of one of our greatest war correspondents 40 years ago .
speak up , young man . you don &apos;t mind being Huntley Haverstock , do you ? a rose by any name , sir .
it &apos;s exciting being present at the christening of an American newspaper correspondent .
shouldn &apos;t we break a bottle of champagne over him ?
break one over my head to see if I &apos;m still awake . &quot; Huntley Haverstock . &quot;
well , Mr. Haverstock , you &apos;d better get started . you &apos;ve got a lot to do ...
passports , photos , visas ... - Expenses .
- I &apos;ll send a note to the cashier .
I hope you brought your Sunday articles over .
I managed three of them .
- See you in London , Mr. Haverstock .
- Yes , of course .
thank you , Mr. Powers . thank you for everything .
except Huntley Haverstock .
get a load of this , Mother .
how &apos;s it look ? chic ?
don &apos;t wear it over one eye .
it makes you look like a gangster .
you always think boys are wearing their hats over one eye . let him wear it the way it is .
he &apos;ll have to wear a stovepipe when he gets to London . they call &apos; em poppers . Toppers , Uncle Bjorn .
Bobby , put that in the box for Uncle John .
- Let me try it on .
- No , I &apos;m going to first .
- Now he &apos;s a regular war correspondent . - Without a war .
he &apos;ll get his war , all right .
Aw , they &apos;re all throwing a big bluff over there .
let &apos;s hope so .
mother , how do you like the way we have our nest furnished ?
I &apos;d hang lighter curtains , and I &apos;d move that sofa out in the middle .
it &apos;s too bad you haven &apos;t an open fireplace .
if you &apos;d speak to the captain , he &apos;d tend to everything .
all ashore that &apos;s going ashore !
now , Mother .
you &apos;re Jones , aren &apos;t you ? my name &apos;s Stebbins , London man for the Globe .
Yes , Mr. Powers told me you &apos;d be here . nice of you to come .
- I lost mine on the way over .
- I can say your other name too ... that Huntley Tavers ... feld ...
I could say it yesterday , but I had a tough session with the boys last night .
- I &apos;ll stick to Jones , if you don &apos;t mind .
- Jones is great with me . let &apos;s get out of here .
this crowd &apos;s making me nervous . my nerves aren &apos;t in the pink this morning .
you take it easy .
I &apos;ll follow you .
porter , bring those bags , and don &apos;t bang them into my knees . very good , sir .
what about a drink after that long train ride ?
sounds like a very logical idea .
I may not act it , but I &apos;ve been here 25 years ...
London man for the Globe , and they haven &apos;t caught on to me yet .
how did you manage it ?
you cable back the government handouts ... and sign &apos; em &quot; our London correspondent . &quot;
- What &apos;s yours ?
- Scotch and soda , please . - Miss ?
Oh , miss ? - Just a moment , sir .
Oh , miss , please ...
Scotch and soda and a glass of milk .
- &quot; A glass of milk &quot; ?
- I &apos;m on the wagon .
I went to the doctor today about these jitters ... and he said it was the wagon for a month or a new set of organs .
I can &apos;t afford new organs .
if I &apos;d known you were on the wagon , I could &apos;ve got along without this ... but as long as it &apos;s here ...
good luck .
- Just like any other scotch and soda .
that &apos;s what I thought .
doesn &apos;t taste the way it did when I was a baby .
that &apos;s got poison in it . speaking of poison , I got some pills ...
Oh , some cables have been coming over from New York .
they love to cable .
makes them think you &apos;re working for them .
there &apos;s an invitation to that lunch for the Dutchman Van Meer tomorrow . I guess that &apos;s your dish .
this is given by the Universal Peace Party .
that &apos;s Fisher &apos;s organization , isn &apos;t it ? I don &apos;t know .
I don &apos;t follow those things very much .
new York wants it , I send it .
that &apos;s the secret of being a correspondent .
been doing it 25 years .
twenty-five years , and I end up on milk .
- Good morning . how &apos;s the water wagon ? - Look at that .
one of them shook off this morning .
Oh ... well , I &apos;m just on my way to the Van Meer luncheon .
I &apos;ve got to have lunch here with old man Clark . he &apos;s the international ...
here you are .
I didn &apos;t know whether to meet you in the grill or upstairs . Hmm . Good-bye , Stebbins .
Good-bye , Miss , uh , Clark .
who is he calling &quot; Clark &quot; ? he &apos;s got his nerve .
Oh , some fresh American reporter .
good morning , Mr. Van Meer . I beg your pardon , sir .
you are Mr. Van Meer , aren &apos;t you ?
that &apos;s my name , yes .
my name &apos;s Haverstock . you don &apos;t know me . I &apos;m an American .
I happened to be on my way to your luncheon .
Ah ? - Then perhaps ...
- That &apos;s very kind of you , sir ... Come .
come , come . it &apos;s all in a good cause .
Savoy Hotel .
- This is very kind of you , Mr. Van Meer .
- It &apos;s a pleasure , my boy .
I dislike riding alone . one thinks too much while riding alone .
the Polish situation ... and the Dutch treaty with the Belgians must be on your mind these days .
what do you feel England will do in case the Nazis ... England is so beautiful , hmm ?
it &apos;s nice to see London in the sunshine .
always there is lots of rain or fog .
Yes , I found out it was August . that was good for me .
but would you mind telling me how you feel ... about Mr. Fisher and his peace organization ?
you know Mr. Fisher ?
Oh , a very fine man .
a good man . I wish there were more like him in the world just now .
then I take it you don &apos;t think there &apos;s much hope for peace .
I mean , you don &apos;t think one little peace organization ... can make much headway against the European war panic .
I would like to think so . Oh , look at those birds .
no matter how big the city , there must always be parks ... and places for the birds to live .
I was walking through the park this morning ... and I saw several people feeding the birds .
that &apos;s a good sign at a time like this , is it not ?
Yes , it &apos;s a dandy sign ... but I think right now the birds are the least of our problems .
your country , for instance ... what might be its attitude ...
Oh , we &apos;re now near the Savoy .
how much ?
by the way , young man ... what newspaper do you represent ?
as a matter of fact , I &apos;m not exactly a reporter ... but I was trying to get you to talk , and I didn &apos;t want bird talk either .
I gathered that .
just what was it you were trying to get me to tell you ?
I was trying to find out what you know about the possibility of a general war .
how do you really feel about it ?
well , I did have one .
the last news from Poland was very alarming .
- Nobody wants war , and yet ...
- Then we don &apos;t have to have it .
Miss Fisher , often circumstances over which we have no control ...
Yes , those very convenient circumstances over which we have no control . it always seems odd , but they usually bring on war .
you never hear of circumstances over which we have no control ... rushing us into peace , do you ?
very determined woman , my daughter .
let &apos;s go and see if you can pick a fight somewhere else . excuse us .
- Good for you .
- Wasn &apos;t he a bore ?
many worthy people are . how do you do ?
how would you like to be fishing in Ireland at this minute ?
we haven &apos;t had a good sail or swim together in months .
not even a game of cribbage . Miss them ?
up anchor , mate . there &apos;s the admiral .
he has a weakness for you . go do your stuff .
Ah , here you are ... the Jones that became a Haverstock .
have a good trip ?
I still wish you were Richard Harding Davis .
- So do I , sir . anything except ...
- Hello .
Hello . meet Mrs. Appleby .
this is Huntley Haverstock ... special correspondent , New York Globe .
- Foreign correspondent ?
not really ? - Cross my heart . you look such a sweet boy .
you don &apos;t seem like the others ... you know , greasy .
- No ?
- But I &apos;m sure you &apos;re marvelous at it .
I wonder if you know a friend , Monty Rockingham .
he &apos;s in the embassy at Istanbul . or is it Honolulu ?
do help me with this distinguished-looking gentleman over here .
I can &apos;t make any headway with him , but I &apos;m sure he must speak some language . everybody does .
I haven &apos;t the least idea who he is ... but there isn &apos;t anybody here who isn &apos;t internationally important .
this is Mr. Haver- Uh , Stock .
no English ?
vous parlez francais ?
- Try German .
- Sprechen Sie Deutsch ?
splendid .
what else do you know ? - Well , only pig latin .
- Pig la- Oh .
here we are . this &apos;ll do it .
Ah .
now we &apos;re getting somewhere .
the universal language . dear Maharaja .
well , they come in pairs .
if you speak English , will you give me a hand with the laughing Latvian ?
what &apos;s he talking ?
Latvian .
no kidding ?
I didn &apos;t know the Lats had a language .
I thought they just rubbed noses .
you mean , you actually speak Latvian ?
Oh , just enough to get about .
what does &quot; just enough to get about &quot; consist of in Latvia ?
well , I don &apos;t think you &apos;d have any trouble .
that &apos;ll be a comfort when I get to Latvia .
you think there might be a chance soon ?
you never can tell in my racket .
I suppose you &apos;ve guessed I &apos;m a foreign correspondent . are you ? that &apos;s nice .
I see you &apos;re taking notes . are you covering this affair too ? - I sort of work here .
- Oh , publicity !
you &apos;re just the one I &apos;m looking for .
we &apos;ve got to go in a secret conference right away . Oh .
me ? excuse me .
I beg your pardon , but I have a Latvian friend here ... who &apos;s particularly interested in the origin of the kilt .
I wonder if you &apos;d be interested in talking to him . he &apos;s a lovely fellow .
you see ... the Greeks , in the early period , they used to wear a kilt . what is this big secret conference all about ?
it &apos;s no secret as far as I &apos;m concerned . however , I &apos;ll let you in on that part later .
but since you &apos;re handling the publicity for this outfit ... you might give me a line on what it &apos;s about ... this League for Peace and Understanding .
what is it you &apos;d like to know ?
first , is this Mr. Fisher entirely on the level ? - Very much so .
- He seems like a very nice guy .
he is , I assure you .
well , what is it that makes him , or you , think ... that an organization like this , made up of well-meaning amateurs ... buck up against those tough military boys of Europe ?
it &apos;s the &quot; well-meaning amateurs , &quot; as you call them ... who do the fighting when the war comes , isn &apos;t it ?
- Please don &apos;t go yet . you don &apos;t want any of those dreary chicken patties .
I must go . then sit at the press table with me .
nobody listens to the speeches at the press table . we could talk .
- You don &apos;t know my name yet . - Is it necessary ?
it is to me .
don &apos;t mind if you hear ... it &apos;s Huntley Haverstock , because it &apos;s really Jones .
- Mine &apos;s really Smith . don &apos;t mind if you hear it &apos;s anything else .
- Waiter ?
- Yes , sir ? same young lady .
try again .
I have taken the young lady 13 notes , sir .
she won &apos;t accept any more .
Milords , ladies ... and gentlemen ... pray silence for your chairman ...
ladies and gentlemen , I have an announcement to make ... which I &apos;m sure will be a great disappointment to us all .
I &apos;ve just received this telegram from Mr. Van Meer ... who was to have been our guest of honor today .
&quot; deeply regret . called away suddenly owing to unforeseen circumstances .
I am with you and your work with all my heart . I could not have said more had I been there . &quot;
although this removes one of our star attractions at the luncheon ... we may have more time to tell you ... from the inside what this party has stood for ... and why we &apos;ve asked you here today .
I can think of no one more competent to do this ... than the speaker I am about to introduce .
I trust you will not think this is a family affair ... when I say I refer to my daughter ...
Miss Carol Fisher .
Milords ... ladies and gentlemen ... pray silence for Miss Carol Fisher .
ladies and gentlemen ...
I trust that , even making allowances for a father &apos;s exuberance ... you do not think I &apos;m in any way being put forward today ... as a substitute for Mr. Van Meer .
Unhappily for us , no one can take Mr. Van Meer &apos;s place .
what I can do , possibly , is to clear up a few misapprehensions ... that seem to have crept into the public discussion of this movement ... and revise some of the epithets applied to us ... by some who have not gone as deeply into the matter as they might .
the female of the &quot; speeches &quot; is deadlier than the male .
... as a group of well-meaning amateurs . I &apos;m sure there are some of you here who think of us as such .
I should like to ask anyone who has called us &quot; well-meaning amateurs &quot; ... to stand up by his chair and tell me just why ... a well-meaning amateur is any less reliable ... than a well-meaning professional at a moment like this ... but I &apos;ll not take the time .
I think the world has been run long enough by the well-meaning professional .
we might give the amateurs their chance now .
but what I really want to do is give you a brief idea of ... just ... just how far-reaching our amateur plans are .
use your notes .
and , uh , just ... why we ask for your support ... professional or amateur .
what I mean is that ... however much one may ...
I mean , we should both ... both of us ...
better to wait in there . - Mr. Fisher , how are you ?
- When did you get over ?
just now . I had a cable from Mr. Powers .
this is my first assignment .
rather ironic assignment : a peace conference in the shadow of war .
you mean it &apos;s really coming ?
today and tomorrow will tell . there &apos;s still hope . - I &apos;m going back to London today .
- Leaving for London ? I only just got here . the conference is just beginning .
today and tomorrow , the work of peace must be done in London rather than Amsterdam .
are you taking your whole staff to London with you , including your ...
no , someone staying here will see you &apos;re given all the help you need .
you &apos;ll be in very good hands . here she is . - Mrs. Appleby , Mr. Haverstock .
- We met at the luncheon .
you remember Mr. , don &apos;t you ?
he &apos;s nice , but I still can &apos;t understand him .
Dr. Williamson , Mr. Huntley Haverstock represents the New York Globe .
he &apos;s unfamiliar with Amsterdam and the machinery of peace meetings .
would you take him under your wing ?
perhaps you and Mrs. Appleby might see he samples eight or ten varieties of Dutch cheese tonight .
now I must see what unlucky person ... is going to give up his seat to me on that plane .
don &apos;t get into any mischief , will you ?
- &quot; Mischief &quot; ? - Your first visit to Amsterdam ?
Yes .
you must let me take you to Rembrandt &apos;s house ...
it might be a good idea if we went over the agenda of the conference .
if you &apos;ll excuse me , I see a friend .
Mr. Van Meer , how are you ?
we seemed to lose each other the day before yesterday .
I &apos;m so sorry you were called away .
don &apos;t you remember me ?
we shared the same cab on the way to the luncheon .
excuse me .
may I have your picture , Mr. Van Meer ?
thank you .
there he goes !
follow that car ! quick !
- You better get out of here . - Don &apos;t be silly .
drive on . - Who &apos;s he shot ?
- Van Meer .
assassinated .
- Dead ?
- Looked like it . bad show .
couldn &apos;t be much worse , from his point of view .
do you mind shoving your knees out of the way ?
you &apos;d better hop in the back , old girl . hurry .
safety glass .
I wonder whose make .
- Good chauffeur you &apos;ve got , Miss Fisher .
- Yes , isn &apos;t he ? - You two know each other ?
- Yeah . I forgot . this is Scott ffolliott .
newspaperman , same as you .
Roaming correspondent . - Mr. Haverstock , Mr. ffolliott .
- With a double F. - How do you do ?
- How do you do ?
- I don &apos;t get the double F .
- At the beginning . both small Fs .
it can &apos;t be at the beginning .
one of my ancestors had his head chopped off by Henry VIII .
his wife dropped the capital letter to commemorate the occasion .
there it is .
- How do you say it ?
like a stutter ? - No , just straight &quot; fuh . &quot;
it &apos;s stopped raining . the sun &apos;s coming out . the police are coming .
that &apos;s the most amazing disappearing trick I &apos;ve ever seen .
don &apos;t suppose they could &apos;ve got up that high , do you ?
Vanished .
take a look for yourself , old boy .
tell him your name , about the two small Fs .
that would be a bit over his head .
well , this isn &apos;t catching any assassins .
we should &apos;ve kept one of those policemen and played bridge .
I guess you &apos;re right .
I &apos;ll bet 2 to 1 on the derby .
look at those sails on that windmill .
you &apos;ll get used to those when you &apos;ve been in Holland longer .
I could &apos;ve sworn they were going against the wind .
why don &apos;t you lie down on the grass and cool off ?
in due time , but first I want you to get the police back here .
the police again ? we don &apos;t want the police .
I &apos;ve decided not to prosecute .
you &apos;ll get the police , &apos; cause our man &apos;s in there . - Where ? - In that mill .
- What makes you think so ?
- A lot can happen while I &apos;m explaining . please get the police .
I &apos;d go if I spoke the language .
- What &apos;ll you do ?
- A bit of snooping .
I hate to seem executive , but this is serious .
- Come on , Scott .
- All right . you shall have your police .
it &apos;s a signal . it &apos;s a signal for that plane to land .
Ah , come in ... and close the door , mister .
Mr. Van Meer .
it isn &apos;t possible .
I &apos;ve just been given a drug ... drug of some sort .
but I saw you shot just now outside the conference hall !
I saw it !
they gave it to me ... when they moved me from ...
the man I saw shot was a dead image !
the man you saw shot ... that wasn &apos;t me .
he was a subs- substitute that looked like me .
but why ? what ...
they ...
they want the world to think ... that I &apos;ve been assassinated . Yes .
to conceal the fact ... that I am in their hands .
&quot; their hands &quot; ? who are &quot; they &quot; ?
I can &apos;t explain .
I &apos;m not cert- This drug ... I can hardly think .
all I can tell you is that ... they are going to take me away by plane ... like a bird .
always are places in the city ... where birds can get crumbs .
birds .
Cru-
Oh , quickly .
a pencil .
you see ?
old mill .
up the road .
look .
old mill . understand ?
does anyone here speak English ?
English ? we speak English in the school .
tell these two policemen ... to come with me .
very , very important .
big old prisoner . old mill .
tell them to follow me . do you understand ?
Yeah . that &apos;s what I &apos;ve been trying to tell you . come on .
they &apos;ve gone .
they &apos;ve killed him .
but if isn &apos;t ...
who are you ?
where are the others ?
there &apos;s been a frame-up . ask him where the others have gone .
he says he doesn &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about . there are no other people .
he &apos;s been asleep here all day .
he &apos;s lying .
I talked to Van Meer in this very room .
well , there &apos;s one thing I can show you ... the assassin &apos;s car , the one we followed .
a unique specimen , old boy . the only one-horse sports car in the world .
that car was here !
listen , I know I look a fool ... but there &apos;s something fishy going on around here .
there &apos;s a big story in this .
I can smell it ... and I &apos;m going to get to the bottom of it .
don &apos;t tell me you &apos;re here to apologize about the windmill .
no , sir .
we simply want you to come with us ... and tell your story to our chief of police .
does this chief of police speak English ?
I &apos;m a very busy man .
it will take no more than half an hour , sir . we all speak English .
that &apos;s marvelous . that &apos;s more than I can say for my country .
would you sit down ? I have to make a phone call .
dinner date with a young lady .
the exchange doesn &apos;t answer . well , I &apos;ll call later . look , I &apos;m a very quick bather .
would you excuse me ... while I jump in the tub and give myself a shave ?
look at some magazines . I &apos;ll be right back .
you couldn &apos;t bring the chief of police here , could you ?
no , I am afraid not .
no , I thought not .
- Please don &apos;t bother to come .
- You &apos;ll find it on my dressing table .
well , we meet again .
so it seems .
quite a lot &apos;s happened since I last saw you . - So I see .
- Uh ...
I , uh , had quite a chase after that guy outside Amsterdam . it &apos;s quite a country .
it &apos;s interesting . windmills and tulips . did you find everything you ...
we were just talking about the tulips .
don &apos;t seem to be any .
I really think I should be going now . thank you very much for the powder .
Oh , must you really go now ?
Yes , I must be going now .
Good-bye .
you &apos;ve made quite a day of it , haven &apos;t you ? Shh !
listen ... Made monkeys out of ffolliott and me , broken into my bedroom ... and disgraced me before a friend of my father &apos;s .
what are your plans now ?
you might at least have had your clothes on . take it easy .
this is serious business .
I &apos;ve seen your &quot; serious business &quot; before .
- What are you doing ?
- Escaping . from what ?
a couple fellows in my room about to kill me .
may I ask who ?
two gentlemen disguised as policemen waiting to take me for a ride .
don &apos;t you think you &apos;ve been talking through your hat long enough ?
I &apos;m not ! I &apos;ve thrown a monkey wrench into some international dirty business .
I know Van Meer &apos;s alive . that &apos;s the reason they want to kill me .
- I can think of others .
- You &apos;ve got to help me ... not for my sake , but this is the biggest story in Europe .
your childish mind is as out of place in Europe as you are in my bedroom .
get over there .
you see what you &apos;re doing , don &apos;t you ?
this is going straight back to London . we &apos;ll be common gossip by tomorrow .
I don &apos;t care for myself , but my father &apos;s engaged in great work . he &apos;s trying to help avert a dreadful war .
this is just the thing to discredit him .
I know you care nothing about our work .
all you &apos;re interested in ... is having fun with windmills and hotel bathrooms .
you don &apos;t believe I &apos;m in trouble .
you &apos;ll be in plenty of trouble if you don &apos;t get out . for the last time , please go .
okay , but I want you to know exactly what &apos;s going to happen when I do go .
I &apos;ll go back to my room and try to shake those fellows off , but I won &apos;t succeed .
they &apos;ll stick to me like a couple of tattoo marks until they get me .
they &apos;ll stop at nothing .
I seem to know too much , and they &apos;re right .
I don &apos;t know the ins and outs of your crackpot movement ... and what &apos;s wrong with Europe , but I do know a story ... and I &apos;ll keep after it until either I get it or it gets me .
sorry you have those derogatory opinions of me ... but I guess that can &apos;t be helped .
well , so long .
it &apos;s been nice knowing you .
I said &quot; good-bye . &quot;
don &apos;t go .
Oh , I guess I could &apos;ve handled those fellows all right , with luck .
we mustn &apos;t take chances . we should get some help .
that &apos;s what I had in mind at first .
I &apos;ll get Dr. Williamson and Mr. Van ... Not with me this way .
they might not understand .
they have understood .
we could catch the boat to England and see Father if you could get out .
that &apos;s the hitch . what &apos;s that friend of yours ? f-f something .
- ffolliott .
- Give me Mr. ffolliott &apos;s room , please .
left the hotel ?
that &apos;s strange . we were to dine together tonight .
he realized how much I meant to you .
you &apos;d mean much more with your clothes on . you like the intellectual type .
say , I &apos;ve got an idea . what ?
the manager , please .
Buzz for the valet , will you ?
Hello , is this the manager ?
this is Mr. Haverstock in 537 . what kind of a hotel is this ?
my bathtub leaks ... my phone &apos;s out of order , and I &apos;ve been robbed .
will you send somebody up right away ?
thank you .
operator , send a waiter up to 537 .
and ask the chambermaid to bring up clean sheets . I &apos;ve set mine on fire .
and I &apos;d like a window-cleaner , and ask boots to come up and get my shoes .
and hurry it up .
that &apos;s a good girl .
that &apos;ll clutter up that room for those two guys .
it &apos;s the valet . come in . - Do you speak English ?
- Go to my room , 537 ...
- 537 . and get me a shirt , tie , suit , and a hat .
you see , my husband &apos;s waiting in the room for this gentleman .
no sign of them yet . come on , let &apos;s hide in the cabin .
- Full up , sir . sorry . - Not even a small cabin ?
not a thing .
everybody in a hurry to get home . I see .
I have a rare bank note here you might be interested in .
that is , if you collect rare bank notes .
sir , I &apos;d do it if I could , but there just isn &apos;t a place left .
aboard an English ship you come up against such an air of incorruptibility .
as a matter of fact , sir , I just had a cabin returned .
- Can I have your name , sir ? - Oh .
one cabin isn &apos;t going to do us much good . we just can &apos;t ...
I fully intended to sleep in the lounge . I hope you didn &apos;t think I ...
no , of course not . it &apos;s very kind of you . fine .
I &apos;ll take it . I &apos;m sorry , sir .
I &apos;m afraid it &apos;s too late now .
you seemed to have some doubt about taking it . I had to let that gentleman have it .
it &apos;s such a rare five-pound note too . the watermark &apos;s upside down .
I think you &apos;d have loved it .
well , perhaps next time .
were you really going to tip that man five pounds ?
of course . I charge all my traveling expenses to the office .
corrupting an official : five pounds .
you &apos;re just a wee bit unscrupulous , aren &apos;t you ?
not unscrupulous . just in love .
- It &apos;s the same thing , I suppose .
- I beg your pardon ?
I beg yours . you see , I love you and I want to marry you .
I love you , and I want to marry you .
well , that cuts our love scene down quite a bit , doesn &apos;t it ?
- Do you mind ?
- Not at all . it &apos;s made a new man of me .
I hope not entirely new . it took me some time ... to get used to the first man you were .
to be perfectly frank , I expected a little more argument .
I &apos;m left with quite a few things I wanted to say .
save them until after we &apos;re married . I imagine they &apos;ll sound much better then .
I &apos;d saved things to say then too .
you were really quite sure of yourself , weren &apos;t you ? funny ...
I didn &apos;t think I had a chance . a guy &apos;s got a right to dream , though , hasn &apos;t he ? evidently .
do you think your father will understand ?
I think Father will be delighted , frankly .
- Good morning , Miss Carol .
- Good morning , Stiles .
- This is Mr. Haverstock .
is Father up yet ? - Yes , miss . he &apos;s having breakfast .
come on .
- Hello , Father .
- What are you doing in London ? Jo ...
Mr. Haverstock brought me back on the boat . nothing wrong , is there ?
you &apos;re not ill ?
you look healthy .
no , I &apos;m fine . it &apos;s Mr. Haverstock .
I hope you don &apos;t mind my barging in .
on the contrary . I &apos;m delighted . you cover a lot of territory , don &apos;t you ?
you didn &apos;t even send a wire . just for that , I hope your trip was perfectly uncomfortable .
it wasn &apos;t so bad . we couldn &apos;t get cabins ... but we managed to sleep on the deck .
monsieur Krug . how nice to see you again .
Mr. Haverstock , Monsieur Krug .
monsieur Krug is a member of the Borovian Embassy staff here .
sit down . have a spot of breakfast .
I know I should tidy up , but I &apos;m simply starved .
so you were in Amsterdam yesterday , Mr. Haverstock ? poor Van Meer .
I count his death a heavy personal loss .
of all people , why Van Meer ?
you can &apos;t ask &quot; why &quot; of an assassin .
there &apos;s no logic in killing . we can &apos;t spare such men in a world like ours .
did you by any chance meet him , Mr. Haverstock ?
not formally , but I saw him die .
horrible .
as a matter of fact , I chased the man that shot him and almost caught him .
Mr. Haverstock is a newspaperman , Monsieur Krug .
that would be quite a coup , bringing in your first story wrapped around an assassin .
I shall have to be getting along now , Mr. Fisher .
shall we settle on the wording for the peace petition now or later ?
we may as well clear it up in the study .
you &apos;ll excuse us ?
father , could I speak to you ?
Meanwhile , see if you can &apos;t interest Mr. Haverstock ... in some eggs and bacon .
Mr. Fisher ...
what &apos;s that man doing here ? it &apos;s Monsieur Krug .
- Van Meer isn &apos;t dead .
- But I just read ...
that was his double . Van Meer was kidnapped .
I talked to him in a mill outside Amsterdam .
what has Krug to do with it ?
remember my description of the man in the mill ?
you mean the sweater ? of course !
but that &apos;s impossible . we &apos;ve known Monsieur Krug ...
Mr. Krug brought Van Meer here by plane last night . he &apos;s in England . they &apos;re hiding him .
positive about this ?
I was as close to Krug as I am to you now .
it &apos;d be terrible if we made a mistake . on the other hand ...
Mr. Fisher .
leave it to me .
I don &apos;t want to seem inhospitable , but I must ask you to leave .
Mr. Haverstock is going to suggest I turn you over to the police .
Mr. Haverstock seems to be something of a troublemaker .
I thought you said he &apos;d been taken care of by our agents in Amsterdam .
I thought so too . I don &apos;t understand if , unless perhaps ...
Miss Fisher &apos;s being with him may have caused complications .
it would &apos;ve been ideal if she &apos;d been in our confidence .
leave my daughter out of it .
- I beg your pardon .
- Most unfortunate , his coming here .
someone has to take care of the sordid details .
but this is close to home . in fact , it is my home .
after all , I &apos;m only a politician . in a sense .
and politicians aren &apos;t usually called upon to , uh ... do away with their guests , are they ?
quiet , boy . quiet .
not in the house . no , sir .
but I have an idea .
- Do you remember Rowley ?
- Rowley ?
Yes , the little man who used to work at your father &apos;s stables in Austria .
Yes , I recall he was present when a mutual friend of ours , um ... accidentally fell off the high bridge at Bern .
if Mr. Haverstock could be induced to hire him ... in the capacity of a private detective ...
- What for ?
- Well ... you should warn him that it is very dangerous to go about London ... with the knowledge that he has .
Yes , I see . Yes .
you use the English language with great delicacy , Krug . thank you , sir .
I shall look Mr. Rowley up at once ... and give him his instructions .
but you mustn &apos;t . it would be too dangerous .
what do we do ?
call Scotland Yard ?
I thought it best to send Krug on his way .
you let him get away ?
well , listen ... Don &apos;t you see how important it is not to rouse Krug &apos;s suspicions ?
- Van Meer will be killed immediately .
- Dead or alive , it &apos;s a story . Johnny , Father &apos;s right .
- Okay , I &apos;ll cable them what I &apos;ve got .
- I wouldn &apos;t if I were you . Van Meer &apos;s life may depend upon our keeping this quiet .
keep it quiet ?
a famous diplomat &apos;s kidnapped under my own eyes , and I muzzle myself ?
I &apos;m sorry , but this is a story with facts ... the kind I was sent here to get , the kind America &apos;s waiting for .
it &apos;ll be bigger if you can wait just a few hours ... until we can find Van Meer and discover what &apos;s behind this whole curious business .
- I know what &apos;s behind it .
- I don &apos;t mean who &apos;s behind it . I mean the why of it .
dear , will you get me all my correspondence with Krug ?
please , Johnny , do what Father says .
it &apos;ll be best for you and poor Mr. Van Meer .
okay . I &apos;ll wait .
I &apos;m worried about you .
I &apos;m a little worried about myself . I feel weak-minded .
you &apos;re doing the right thing , but I don &apos;t like you dashing about without protection .
forget it .
if what you say is true , you need protection .
I &apos;ve covered beer mob killings and race riots since I was a tot without even a rabbit &apos;s foot .
these people are criminals , more dangerous than your rumrunners and housebreakers .
they &apos;re fanatics .
they combine a mad love of country with an equally mad indifference to life ... their own as well as others .
and I really couldn &apos;t face Mr. Powers again ... if you didn &apos;t live long enough to turn in the best story of the year .
I &apos;m gonna be a fine foreign correspondent hiding in an attic somewhere .
I &apos;m not suggesting you hide anywhere . just get somebody to watch out for you . a nurse ?
Johnny Jones goes to Europe and hires a nurse .
that &apos;s gonna look great on the expense account .
I know a very efficient private detective agency where we can get just the man .
- Okay , whatever you say .
- I can arrange it all for you .
if it &apos;ll make you feel better , I won &apos;t mention it to anybody .
if anyone finds out I &apos;ve hired a bodyguard , I &apos;ll shoot myself .
if that &apos;s Mr. Rowley , tell him to wait outside . Yes , sir .
I &apos;ve called on Mr. Haverstock .
will you tell him Mr. Rowley is here ?
- Will you wait here , please ? - Thank you .
- Mr. Haverstock , your cab &apos;s here .
- Where are you going ?
- To the office . I &apos;ve got work to do .
- But you mustn &apos;t go .
I was sent over here at great expense as a newspaperman , not a refugee .
- How about lunch at the Savoy ?
- I &apos;ll see you out .
Johnny , please be careful .
I &apos;ll be all right .
Mr. Haverstock ?
is this the man ?
look , who &apos;s protecting who ?
well , I ain &apos;t lanky , sir , but I &apos;m quick .
I take it you understand what to do .
you can trust me to take care of Mr. Haverstock .
are we going now , sir ?
Yes , you can take me to my office , and if you &apos;re good ... - to the American Club .
- Right , sir .
you &apos;ll keep after this other thing ?
as soon as there &apos;s news , I &apos;ll let you know . then you can break the story . Good-bye .
Good-bye , sir .
why , Carol .
nothing must happen to him , Father . I just couldn &apos;t ...
how do we go , sir ?
would you like me to walk behind you , or beside you , like a friend ?
- What &apos;s the custom ?
- Different people has different tastes . with the Duke of Albatrorr , the duke , being a democratic gent ...
I used to walk alongside of him , man-to-man , like .
on the other hand , I once had a lady who thought that was disrespectful .
&quot; three paces behind , &quot; she says , &quot; and don &apos;t smoke on duty . &quot;
what &apos;s good enough for a duke is good enough for me . thank you , sir .
if we want to go to the American Club , we &apos;d better take a cab .
what &apos;s the trouble , sir .
is it gangsters after you ?
not exactly . we &apos;re not afraid of gangsters over here , sir .
- Even our police don &apos;t carry guns .
- What do they do ? hit you over the head with a stick .
a bit more healthy-like .
did you see that ?
someone deliberately pushed me !
that was me , sir . if I &apos;d have pulled you back , you &apos;d have been caught . it was push or nothing .
smart work , Mr. Rowley . thank you very much .
after all , that &apos;s what I &apos;m here for , isn &apos;t it ?
- American Club . - Yes , sir . after you , sir .
I &apos;m not certain , sir , but I &apos;ve got an idea ... two men just got in another cab to follow us .
I don &apos;t see anyone suspicious .
well , I may have been mistaken ... but I &apos;m almost certain I saw them .
they may have heard where we &apos;re going . driver .
driver ?
go down Victoria Street ... &apos; round past Buckingham Palace .
right , sir .
we might give &apos; em the slip if we go the long way around .
I &apos;m afraid they &apos;re still after us .
our best plan is to pull &apos; round the next corner and change cabs .
driver ? take the first to your left and pull up .
we &apos;re going to walk a bit .
I &apos;ll do it , sir . I understand the money . it &apos;ll be quicker .
thank you , sir .
our best plan is to slip into the cathedral for a bit .
let &apos;s call off this ducking and let them catch up with us and have a showdown .
I wouldn &apos;t cause a scene .
our job is to give &apos; em the slip .
all right . - Let &apos;s go .
- Nice bit of architecture , sir , innit ?
do you mind not going right in , sir ?
I saw by the notice it was a requiem mass ... a mass for the dead .
that sort of thing always depresses me ... praying for the dead and all that .
the dead are all right in their place , sir ... but the music and the candles always gives me the creeps .
it does really , sir . I don &apos;t like to be so fussy ...
how about a trip up top , sir ?
that &apos;d really put &apos; em off the scent .
boys , careful there .
- I can &apos;t see .
- Eh ?
here , here .
there you are , me boy . Ooh !
look , there it goes . there .
I &apos;ll have to buy you another now . love a duck !
careful , boys . you better be careful too , sir .
not yet , boys .
let &apos;s get out of here . I have a luncheon date and plenty to do before it .
I &apos;ve got it in mind , sir . don &apos;t you worry .
really , now , look . isn &apos;t it worthwhile coming up here to see it , sir ?
there &apos;s the houses of Parliament over there .
and there &apos;s St. James &apos;s Park . that green patch .
Yeah . come along , boys .
you must excuse me getting so scared when you leaned over just now , sir .
I was once with a man on a bridge in Switzerland .
he had a very nasty fall . killed him .
always made me a bit nervous since .
don &apos;t go down just yet , sir . I &apos;d like you to see St. Paul &apos;s .
there it is , just coming out of the mist . Oh , and look .
there &apos;s the &apos; orse guards approaching Buckingham Palace . - See &apos; em ? down there .
- It makes the backs of me legs go funny . height always did .
let &apos;s get down again , Eric .
why didn &apos;t you say so before ?
Miss , I know just how you feel . them as has no head for heights can &apos;t help it .
nobody ought not to blame them .
- What &apos;s it got to do with you ? - All right , keep your head on . - I was only sympathizing .
- I &apos;m going down anyway .
- Wait for the lift .
- No .
no stairs for me . I &apos;m gonna take the elevator .
wait a minute , sir . you ain &apos;t seen the &apos; orse guards yet .
you must see the &apos; orse guards , sir .
where ?
I don &apos;t see anything .
why , there they are , sir . down the road .
just going toward the ... the white building .
no , boys . this way .
well , there but for the grace of God .
I still don &apos;t know what instinct made me step aside when he came at me .
you need a drink .
I heard the lift coming up , and I turned .
I saw that look in his eye as he came toward me .
in that split second , the whole thing flashed through my mind .
all I could think of was Fisher . &quot; Fisher planned this . &quot;
then I guess I just stepped aside , and over he went .
over he went , all right .
did you want this ?
no , thanks . when are you going to send the story to our esteemed gazette ?
when I get ready .
well , there goes another of my illusions .
I thought you were one of those journalists nothing could stop .
floods , smallpox , love ... the story must go on .
it &apos;ll go on .
no .
I can understand you not wanting to drag Miss Fisher into it .
on the other hand , she &apos;s probably in it already .
- The moll of the gang .
- Why , you dirty ...
on second thought , I &apos;m sure not .
I &apos;m sure she &apos;s a fine girl ... upstanding , honest , with a great soul .
I can &apos;t send the story on Van Meer until he &apos;s safe . we &apos;ve got to find Van Meer first .
Ah , there &apos;s our man now , probably .
Mr. Van Meer , come in .
good morning , Stebbins . how are you , Haverstock ?
congratulations on your little set-to with Rowley .
what do you know about Rowley ?
very little ffolliott doesn &apos;t hear . he probably even knows about Fisher .
I was onto Fisher a year ago ... but that fellow with the high-neck sweater ...
- Krug ... he &apos;s new to me ... - You &apos;re onto him too ?
- Followed him to London .
- I thought you were cold on this story .
on the contrary . I &apos;ve been doing a bit of noticing .
- Remember that tramp asleep in the mill ? - Yeah .
- He wasn &apos;t a tramp at all .
- Van Meer , I suppose .
not quite , but I noticed him do a strange thing for a tramp .
he dirtied his hands with some of that nasty Dutch soil .
I can &apos;t follow the workings of these masterminds .
no . tell him it &apos;s ridiculous .
you &apos;d already disappeared , so I followed Krug ... but ended up at the same old mousetrap .
you mean Fisher ?
the good , kind , genial head of the Peace Party , Herr Fisher .
Hello , Eddie ? this is Plunger Stebbins .
I want to place a bet on Flibbertigibbet in the first ...
the race is over ? what do you know about that ?
okay , I &apos;ll call you later .
any objection to working the rest of this thing together ?
catch Fisher , find Van Meer , that sort of thing ?
all right , but I &apos;d like to know why they kidnapped Van Meer .
he was one of the signatories to a certain treaty .
the most important clause was never written down ... just memorized by the two people who signed .
they &apos;re gonna beat it out of him ? they &apos;re going to try .
it &apos;d be a good idea if we put a stop to them .
it contains information that would be valuable to the enemy ... in the war that breaks out tomorrow , weather permitting .
why didn &apos;t someone let me in on this ?
- Stebbins , we &apos;ve got to get busy .
- Plenty of time . lunch first . you mind waiting ?
you might be of some help . I thought up a little plan for forcing Fisher &apos;s hand .
let &apos;s have it .
I think the neatest thing would be to kidnap Fisher &apos;s daughter .
Oh , yeah ?
one of Fisher &apos;s few genuine traits is his affection for Miss Fisher .
easy . you &apos;re speaking to the man who loves her .
all the better . give you a chance to get chummy ... and keep her out of this mess while we batter away at papa .
this is my scheme :
I walk in , let Fisher know ... his daughter &apos;s in the hands of someone who means business ... just as he means business when he kidnaps people .
- I thought you were a newspaperman .
that doesn &apos;t include kidnapping your fiancee where I come from .
- It would if your country were at stake .
- This isn &apos;t my country .
it &apos;s your story . don &apos;t be gloomy . she doesn &apos;t have to know .
- Just keep her amused . - Why not grab Fisher and have a showdown ?
no good . we &apos;ve got nothing on Fisher . he &apos;d slip out of it anyway .
all we &apos;d do would be to kill Van Meer .
are you all right ?
what were you doing on the tower ?
trying to keep out of harm &apos;s way , but those assassins followed .
there was a scuffle , and over he went .
darling , they won &apos;t stop till they get you .
you must leave London immediately .
the one thing everybody forgets is I &apos;m a reporter .
there &apos;s a war . I can &apos;t run out .
Scott , he can &apos;t stay here . tell him how desperate these men are .
he shouldn &apos;t stay another minute . take him somewhere .
I won &apos;t go .
couldn &apos;t you think up some aunt in the country or something ?
there &apos;s my Aunt Margaret at Harpenden . let me take you there .
- How about it ?
- Stay out of this .
it &apos;s the only sensible thing to do .
may I use your telephone ?
Hello , Stiles ? Miss Carol speaking .
tell Mr. Fisher I &apos;m driving down to Aunt Margaret &apos;s at Harpenden .
- I won &apos;t go .
- I &apos;ll be back in time for dinner . thank you .
it &apos;s settled .
we can get you a toothbrush ...
it &apos;s no good .
I &apos;m wondering whether this idea of your aunt is so good .
maybe it &apos;d be better further out ... say , Cambridge .
there &apos;s no place as obscure as Harpenden .
it isn &apos;t so much the place ... as the fact Krug might connect you with it .
you &apos;re right . make it Cambridge .
I &apos;ll phone your father so he doesn &apos;t worry . thank you , Scott .
please , Johnny ?
that was a break , her suggesting they go to the country .
as a matter of fact , old boy , I suggested it to her ... on the phone about half an hour ago .
there hasn &apos;t been a sign of anybody for the last 30 miles .
- What &apos;s the matter ? - Nothing .
you might at least talk to me .
it &apos;s unfair to sit there and pout ... because I &apos;ve kidnapped you from your so-called duties .
- You &apos;ve kidnapped me ? - Mm-hmm .
- Just remember that , will you ?
- Please forgive me .
why , sure .
I don &apos;t think kidnapping &apos;s ... anything to get sore about when done by the right kidnapper , do you ?
- Not at all . - Thanks .
Hello ?
no , Mr. ffolliott .
I &apos;m afraid he &apos;s not in yet . very well , sir .
- Johnny , you don &apos;t love me .
- You &apos;re crazy . - You looked unhappy when you kissed me .
- Never happier in my life .
won &apos;t do . Johnny , what &apos;s happened ?
the war , I guess . they say it &apos;s coming tomorrow .
so you &apos;ve changed your philosophy since yesterday .
there are more important things in the world than love .
- I &apos;ve got lots to do .
important things . - Carol ...
got to get started . it &apos;ll take three hours to get back .
I &apos;m not going to be misunderstood .
I &apos;m so in love , I &apos;m going mad .
won &apos;t do .
I suppose it can &apos;t be helped . you &apos;ve turned European on me overnight , Johnny .
that &apos;s unfair . I &apos;m just as big a jackass as I ever was .
bigger . you &apos;re not going back to London to dinner tonight .
you can &apos;t run out on your kidnapper like that .
I mean ... Well , you know what I mean .
if you run out on me now , I &apos;m going ... straight to London and let them bump me off .
be a relief at that .
well , you are moody . am I the cause ?
if you knew how much I loved you , you &apos;d faint .
there . what &apos;d I tell you ?
come in .
- Mr. Haverstock ?
- Yes ? - Call from London .
- Have them switch it up .
sorry , there &apos;s only one phone ...
in the office . all right , I &apos;ll come down .
forgive me for a moment , dear .
just a moment , sir .
Hello ?
is that you , Haverstock , old boy ?
are you alone ?
can you talk ? I can &apos;t get a hold of Fisher . he &apos;s been out all afternoon .
I &apos;m afraid you &apos;ll have to keep the girl much longer than we &apos;d planned .
I don &apos;t know what time he &apos;ll be back .
I &apos;ve got to catch him alone . keep the girl there for the night .
but that &apos;s absolutely impossible .
we can &apos;t let this thing go now .
I can &apos;t very well explain , but I simply couldn &apos;t pull a thing like that .
you &apos;ve got to try . there isn &apos;t anything else to be done .
I &apos;m counting on you .
Hello ?
Hello ?
are you quite satisfied with your room , sir ?
well , not exactly .
that is , I mean , yes ... but I really wanted another room as well ... a single room .
Oh .
Mr. Naismith ? Mr. Naismith , this gentleman wants another room .
for the young lady ? how long will you be requiring it ?
she &apos;ll only be here just the one might .
- The gentleman has number 7 , sir .
- What about number 8 ?
it doesn &apos;t really make any difference , so long as it &apos;s a good room ...
windows and all that . I quite understand , sir . I think perhaps the room next to yours would be best .
it &apos;s quite cozy , isn &apos;t it , Miss Pollitt ?
number 8 ? - They &apos;re all very much alike to me , sir .
- Eight &apos;ll do .
will you bring the young lady and sign the book , please ?
Yes , I &apos;ll ... I &apos;ll get her .
- Good evening , sir .
- Good evening , Stiles .
terrible thing , sir , that poor man who was here this morning .
Yes , terrible , Stiles . my bags all packed ?
- Yes , sir .
- And Miss Carol &apos;s ?
Mrs. Stiles packed hers too .
she hopes she &apos;s put in the right things . it &apos;s been such a rush , especially with Miss Carol not back yet .
Mr. ffolliott &apos;s here now . he &apos;s waiting in the sitting room .
another gentleman just phoned . he wouldn &apos;t leave his name .
I thought I recognized his voice as the foreign gentleman who was here at breakfast .
- Did he say he &apos;d telephone again ?
- Yes , he said it was urgent .
well , show Mr. ffolliott into the study .
Hello , sir . Scott , you caught me at a very busy moment . I &apos;m getting ready to go to America tomorrow .
are you taking Carol with you ?
Yes . she doesn &apos;t know yet .
it &apos;s been such a rush . I &apos;m waiting for her now .
what &apos;s your worry ? must be important , by the number of times you telephoned .
Yes , it is , sir .
it &apos;s about Carol . - I &apos;m afraid that ... - What ?
anything happen to her ?
I don &apos;t think you &apos;ll be able to take her to America .
what do you mean ? why not ?
it &apos;ll sound rather silly to you , but Carol has been kidnapped .
- Is this a joke of some sort ?
- No , sir .
what do you mean , &quot; kidnapped &quot; ?
I happen to know she &apos;s with her aunt in Harpenden .
I &apos;m afraid she isn &apos;t .
Stiles , who gave you the message that Miss Carol had gone to her Aunt Margaret &apos;s ?
Miss Carol herself , sir .
- Thank you , Stiles . - That &apos;s where she thought she was going .
get me Harpenden 43422 .
Hello , is that you , Margaret ?
is Carol with you ?
no . no , I ...
I wasn &apos;t &apos; certain . she said she might run down to see you .
I didn &apos;t know whether to expect her back for dinner .
right . good night , Margaret .
no , she isn &apos;t there .
what makes you say she &apos;s been kidnapped ?
well , sir ...
I arranged it .
this has gone far enough . where is Carol ?
Carol &apos;s being held as a sort of hostage ... by some people who are very much in earnest ... as much as you are .
don &apos;t be so cryptic .
I haven &apos;t the faintest idea what you &apos;re talking about .
I want to know where you &apos;re hiding Van Meer .
so that &apos;s it . you &apos;ve been talking with Haverstock .
he was here this morning telling us about Van Meer still being alive .
you promised Haverstock you &apos;d look into it , didn &apos;t you ?
naturally .
an unusual way of looking into it , trying to have him put out of the way .
I realize a life or two is a small matter , the way you work .
well , the people who have got Carol can take a leaf out of your book .
where is she ?
what have you done with her ?
where &apos;s Van Meer ?
Hello ?
I think I can get our Dutch friend to talk if you come along .
sorry to drag you here like this , but I think it &apos;s the only way ... if you want to leave tomorrow .
when you get here , ask at the cashier &apos;s desk ... to use the phone .
they &apos;ll show you straight up .
very well . I &apos;ll drop in as soon as I can .
if you want Carol , you &apos;d better tell me where Van Meer is .
bring her back . I &apos;ll give you the address .
Carol can be home in three hours ... but I want that address now .
you &apos;ll have it as soon as Carol is home .
I can &apos;t possibly wait three hours .
besides , I happen to want Van Meer alive .
well , Scott , I delivered him , all right .
good . I &apos;ll be getting along now .
thanks very much for those points for my leader . can I take them now ? good night , Carol .
good night , sir . good night .
this isn &apos;t like you . what is it that &apos;s upset you so ?
I know I &apos;m being silly . I &apos;m behaving perfectly stupidly .
I wouldn &apos;t mind so much ... but I didn &apos;t think he was that sort of person .
something to do with young Haverstock ?
you like him very much , don &apos;t you ?
after what happened today ... I drove him down to the country to get him away from those people ...
I thought you were going to Aunt Margaret &apos;s .
we were , but Scott ffolliott ... thought it would be better to go further away .
so ... I thought the College Arms at Cambridge would be a good place .
when we got there , I found out he wanted ...
you see , we &apos;d been joking about it ... but when I heard him book the extra room , I knew he meant it .
such a cheap trick .
that &apos;s what hurts . &quot; it was so cheap .
it wasn &apos;t at all like I thought he was .
what difference does it make ?
I don &apos;t care if I ever see him again .
you won &apos;t have to . we &apos;re going to America tomorrow by clipper .
tomorrow ?
I suppose I can , but why tomorrow ? it &apos;s our last chance .
war will probably be declared tomorrow . I have to get to Washington . the boats will be crowded .
we &apos;re liable to wait weeks .
- But what about Mr. Van Meer ?
- We &apos;ve done all we could .
I was at the foreign office with Ainsworth this afternoon . they &apos;re taking the whole thing over .
Stiles , what is it ?
the blackout , sir . I have to draw the blinds . Oh , I forgot .
before you do that , order me a taxi , will you ? Yes , sir .
I &apos;ve got people I must see before we leave .
I &apos;ll try not to be long . Mrs. Stiles has done your packing .
I thought we might go to Southampton , stay at the Southwestern . Stiles , and my hat , please .
Good-bye , darling .
in the meantime , you and Stiles might be loading the car so as not to lose time .
- You &apos;d better eat .
- What about you ? I &apos;ll get a sandwich later .
242 Charlotte Street ... halfway up Tottenham Court Road .
wait here until Haverstock turns up .
he &apos;s bound to come here .
bring him along to 242 Charlotte Street ... off Tottenham Court Road .
- Hello ? - Hello .
Hello ?
be careful .
might I use your telephone ?
this way , sir .
where is he ?
in there .
we can &apos;t make him say anything . it &apos;s up to you .
let &apos;s get it over . is this place safe ?
there &apos;ll be no interruption . we closed it for decoration .
- Those people downstairs ?
- They won &apos;t make any trouble .
they know what will happen to their relatives in the homeland if they do .
not a very attractive nest , and the music a little vulgar ... but if serves its purpose .
Yes .
pardon me .
put your arm around him ... and hold his head forward .
these lights ... can &apos;t you cut them down ?
I thank you .
you &apos;re like my friend , Mr. Fisher .
I &apos;m sorry . it &apos;s just so dark .
I cannot tell , but ... but you are so like my friend .
Oh ! I am so glad .
Mr. Fisher , are the police here ?
Oh , they mustn &apos;t get away .
you mustn &apos;t let these people go .
I represent the Jupiter Life Assurance . could I interest you in a small policy ?
- Why did you bring him up ?
- I didn &apos;t know what to do .
I &apos;d relieve the lady of this embarrassment ... but you know how women are with firearms .
no sense of timing . I &apos;ll just sit here .
you carry on with whatever you were doing . don &apos;t mind me . I sometimes sit like this for hours .
who &apos;s that ?
is it the police ?
Oh , tell me where I am .
you are in London , Mr. Van Meer .
in London ?
have I been here long ?
Oh , you must send a telegram ... to my wife .
tell her I am safe with you . please try to understand . the police are not here .
I am here merely to talk to you .
but these ... these people ...
they think I &apos;m working with them .
they don &apos;t know I &apos;m your friend .
we must play a little game .
- A little game ? - Yes .
they have asked me to get you to tell me ... what they are trying to find out .
but I can &apos;t do that .
you can tell me , Mr. Van Meer .
just that one clause in the treaty .
clause 27 .
come , Mr. Van Meer .
but it &apos;s the ... the secret clause .
I know it : clause 27 .
but they ... they mustn &apos;t know it .
it would help them if they make war . war , Fisher .
you don &apos;t want them helped , do you ?
of course not . just let them see you telling it to me .
it &apos;ll be enough . just let them see you whisper it to me .
I &apos;ll promise to keep it safe .
he &apos;s not your friend . don &apos;t fell him .
who was that ?
someone just said you weren &apos;t my friend .
why didn &apos;t you bring the police ?
Ah . you are not taking me away .
why ?
you are so ...
F-Fisher ?
help me .
help me , Fi ...
Oh , yes .
I see now . there &apos;s no help .
no help for the whole ... poor , suffering world . Oh , you ... you cry peace , Fisher .
peace . and there was no peace .
only war and death .
you &apos;re ...
you &apos;re a liar , Fisher . a cruel , cruel liar .
you can do what you want with me .
that &apos;s not important . but you &apos;ll never conquer them , Fisher .
little people everywhere ... who give crumbs to birds ... lie to them ... drive them , whip them ... force them into war .
when the beasts like you ... will devour each other ... then the world ... will belong to the little people .
we &apos;re wasting valuable time .
Kurt .
all right . I ... I will speak .
I will tell everything . come on , Mr. Fisher .
in the event of invasion by an enemy ...
why , it &apos;s only a restaurant .
look ! come on !
this way , sir ! down the back stairs !
follow me !
come on , Haverstock !
they must &apos;ve gone out some other way !
you &apos;re an idiot if you don &apos;t nab Fisher before he gets on that plane .
how can we arrest him without any evidence ?
don &apos;t be so obstinate. isn &apos;t Van Meer himself proof enough ?
no , and you ought to know it .
what proof is there against Fisher personally ?
of all the conceited , stupid numbskulls ...
if you &apos;d stop behaving like a Boy Scout and let us handle this ...
ask McKenna to come in here .
why don &apos;t you go see Dr. Boniface ?
he &apos;s good for nerves . - Identification of Van Meer complete ?
- Absolutely .
he &apos;s unconscious in the nursing home , but there &apos;s no doubt it &apos;s Van Meer . you &apos;d better get back there .
take somebody with you .
get a statement as soon as he comes to .
in the meantime , send a man to keep an eye on that flying boat and await instructions from us .
what &apos;s the good of being related to Scotland Yard ?
I can &apos;t get my brother to do anything .
Scotland Yard can &apos;t solve my problems .
Scotland Yard &apos;s in on it .
everybody but me . you &apos;re in it too .
we &apos;ve got to get on that plane and keep an eye on Fisher .
while we &apos;re driving down , ring up Mayfair 24574 .
- Just a moment .
let me get it down . - Mayfair 24574 . that &apos;s my cousin .
he &apos;s the director of the airline .
tell him I &apos;ve got to have two seats on the clipper for America tomorrow morning .
then go to the Hilton Nursing Home and stick by Van Meer .
then phone Miss Edith Armbruster , Kensington 66255 Tell her I &apos;m off to America .
will she dine with me next Monday instead of tomorrow ?
- Square it with her , will you .7
- Sure , sure . then call up Stephens at the Post and tell him I &apos;m off to America .
cable New York . tell them I &apos;m off to America .
then ring up the Crescent Dancing Academy and cancel my rumba lesson . two ham sandwiches on rye bread .
there &apos;s no use my waiting around . I have several things ...
hard to say how soon he &apos;ll recover .
it may be hours before he can speak .
I don &apos;t know much about this , but my friend &apos;s on the clipper .
the minute Van Meer speaks , they &apos;ll send word to the plane .
did you hear the wireless ?
we &apos;re at war . war declared ! read all about it !
special war edition ! war declared !
it &apos;s war with Germany ! war declared !
Miss Pimm ? Miss Pimm , I found that picture .
- Steward , bring me one of those , please . - Yes , sir .
- Any message for me ? - What name , sir ?
steward , is there a message for me ?
Mrs. Benson . I &apos;ll be with you in a minute , madam .
- This one &apos;s for me .
lovely , isn &apos;t it ? sort of makes you forget all about the war and troubles .
it would be nice if we could just keep flying ... for a long time , live in the clouds .
Yes , it would be very nice .
but it &apos;s time for me to make a landing ... a forced landing .
what &apos;s the matter ?
anything happen ?
I &apos;ve got to talk to you . I don &apos;t want to , but I &apos;ve got to .
it &apos;s the hardest part ... talking to you now . I don &apos;t mind about the rest , really .
it &apos;s about Krug and Van Meer .
you &apos;ve guessed .
not till last night . I &apos;ve just been worried .
but I believed in you .
you shouldn &apos;t . it &apos;s true , then , what I wouldn &apos;t believe ?
Yes .
I &apos;m to be arrested when we land ... - Oh !
- As a spy , shipped back to London .
- That &apos;s quite all right , except ... just the one phase of it : you .
I should like you to hear a little from my own point of view .
it might help you ...
afterwards . first about yourself , my deceiving you .
I had to .
I didn &apos;t want you involved because you &apos;re English ... half English , anyway .
I &apos;m not . I &apos;m just coated with an English accent ... a very thin coat .
I &apos;ve fought for my country in my heart in a very difficult way ... because sometimes it &apos;s harder to fight dishonorably ... than nobly in the open .
I &apos;ve used my country &apos;s methods because I was born with them .
I don &apos;t intend making this sort of plea to the court-martial .
I &apos;m making it only to my daughter , whom I &apos;ve loved dearly ... and before whom I feel a little ... ashamed .
what you say to me now means much more to me than any other verdict ... my dear .
- Steward ? - Yes , sir ? this is not for me .
I &apos;m not gonna sit here another 14 hours and play hide-and-seek with her .
I &apos;m gonna talk to her and have it over with .
I don &apos;t see that you could do any harm .
he knows we &apos;re on the plane . - Not a word in front of her , understand ?
- I wouldn &apos;t dream of talking .
- What are you going to say ?
- How do I know ?
I &apos;m all mixed up . in love with the girl and gonna help hang her father .
I &apos;ve got to say something or go crazy .
would a little brandy make you feel better ?
you know it always makes me cry harder . - Oh !
- Surprise .
- What are you doing here ?
- Just having myself a ride .
look , Carol , I &apos;ve got to speak to you alone . it &apos;s very important . do you mind , Mr. Fisher ?
- ffolliott &apos;s with you , isn &apos;t he ?
- In a way , yes . and you &apos;re both after my father .
you &apos;re going to have him arrested , aren &apos;t you ?
I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
I never arrested anyone in my life .
that &apos;s a lie . you &apos;ve been following him from the beginning .
that &apos;s why you wanted me out of the way yesterday at the inn .
pretended you loved me , tried to keep me overnight so you could ... it &apos;s a lie , that &apos;s all .
everything you &apos;ve said to me have been lies . - Hello .
quite a reunion , isn &apos;t it ?
- You too ?
please , dear . stay and have a drink , Scott . - I &apos;ll be back .
- Where are you going ? just to stretch my legs .
I read that wireless you received .
- It was given to me by mistake .
- That &apos;s all right , sir .
you &apos;re not going unless I go with you . I know you both think my father is a traitor and a renegade .
well , he isn &apos;t ... not to me .
thanks .
it &apos;s a minority report , but very welcome .
Carol , I &apos;ve got nothing to do with spies . I &apos;m just a reporter .
I came here after a story .
I &apos;m sorry I heard of Van Meer .
I &apos;d blow up the Globe ... and cut Mr. Powers &apos;s throat rather than harm you .
what is it ?
they &apos;ve gone crazy .
what do they think they &apos;re doing ?
who are they ?
go below .
tell them we &apos;re being attacked .
sorry about this . it has nothing to do with me . we &apos;re coming down .
you &apos;re the most amazing , cool-headed woman I &apos;ve ever seen .
- Make Father wear this . - Right . here you are .
put these on .
could you come out , sir ? they &apos;re all going nuts !
I &apos;ll be out immediately . what am I going to say ?
this isn &apos;t like bad weather . tell them it &apos;s a mistake , that it &apos;s target practice .
I know it &apos;s foolish for me to ask you to be calm .
are we all going to be drowned ?
keep away from that window , sir . it might be dangerous . sit back .
I &apos;m not going to put this on .
what are they firing at ? I never heard of anything so stupid .
I shall see the British consul as soon as ...
she &apos;s gone .
what in the name of heaven are they doing ?
switch off the gas . you &apos;ve got the other port motor . they cut off the other starboard motor .
right . it &apos;s German , the Von Schier .
she thought we were a bomber .
she &apos;s steaming to our rescue .
the Wing &apos;s coming off !
- Let me get out !
- Come away from that door !
we &apos;re crazy to stay here .
when she hits the water , the tail &apos;s the best place . right .
Mr. Fisher !
no good staying on here . she &apos;s going under .
quick ! onto the wing !
there &apos;s the pilot !
don &apos;t let him on , fools ! we shall all go down !
shut your mouth !
- I &apos;m gonna throw that swine off .
- No , he &apos;s right . it won &apos;t hold us .
I &apos;d better slip away .
quickly move to the other end . that might make it lighter here .
he &apos;s gone !
Johnny , don &apos;t go ! you &apos;ll be washed away !
Johnny , come back !
look !
it must be the enemy coming to pick us up .
is it the enemy ?
she &apos;s American .
American ship Mohican picked us all up , taking us back to London .
I can &apos;t tell you what happened . we &apos;re not allowed .
I &apos;ll wire from London in a couple of days . Bye , Franklin . this is awkward .
I &apos;ve just been having a dirty row with the captain .
the fellow insists on acting the true-blue neutral .
&quot; enemy waters . &quot; not a line to the press from his ship .
can &apos;t send out any stories ?
we can only use the wireless for private messages .
&quot; Hello , Aunt Effie . safe aboard the Mohican . feeling tip-top . &quot;
I ask you !
two days before we get to London , we get scooped on our own story .
why don &apos;t you have a crack at brass buttons ?
what &apos;s the use ? what good will it do me ?
my hands are tied . - What are you talking about ?
- Carol .
I came 4,000 miles to get a story .
I get shot at like a duck , pushed off buildings ...
I get the story , and then I got to shut up .
what are you grinning at ? I &apos;m not gonna throw her father up for grabs .
he died like a hero to save her and the rest of us .
I guess I &apos;m talking through my hat .
the whole point is he was her father ... and I &apos;m not gonna play Judas to the only girl ...
I &apos;m glad you &apos;ve said that . very glad . - You dry ?
you all right ? - I &apos;m all right .
I want you to send it , the whole story .
- We &apos;ll talk about that later .
- No , please . you can &apos;t help me by protecting my father .
listen , I &apos;m in love with you . I can &apos;t hit you with a scandal for a wedding present .
Johnny , my father fought for his country his way .
it wasn &apos;t a straight way , but it was a hard way .
and I &apos;ve got to fight for my country a hard way .
okay , if that &apos;s the way you feel about it . I guess that &apos;s for me .
I put in a call to my uncle ... Uncle Powers .
Hello ? Hello ?
Johnny Jones calling from the Mohican . what the deuce is he doing there ?
wait .
Johnny wouldn &apos;t call if it wasn &apos;t a story . tell them to hold the presses .
send Bradley in . tell him we &apos;re breaking up page one .
Hello ? Hello , Mr. Powers .
this is Johnny Jones .
easy .
here comes the captain .
Mr. Powers , keep your ear glued to this phone ... and don &apos;t hang up .
Mr. Haverstock , I want to talk with you .
Yes , sir ?
I &apos;ve just found out you &apos;re a newspaperman .
I guess that &apos;s right .
why didn &apos;t you tell me that when I questioned you ? - You lied to me , sir .
- My dear captain ... when you &apos;ve been shot down in a British plane by a German destroyer ... 300 miles off the coast of England ...
latitude 45 ... and have been hanging on to a half-submerged wing for hours ... waiting to drown with half a dozen other stricken human beings ... you &apos;re liable to forget you &apos;re a newspaperman for a moment .
you &apos;re gonna have to forget it for as long as you &apos;re on this ship .
I can &apos;t understand your attitude , sir .
you performed a heroic rescue . Captain John Martin . you took us out of the sea .
you &apos;re not sending anything from this ship . - That &apos;s final . - You &apos;re absolutely right , Captain .
we mustn &apos;t embarrass the United States government . exactly .
that &apos;s my point .
that &apos;s the story . if you don &apos;t want me to print it , okay .
- But you ought to hear it first .
- That &apos;s only fair .
you know who the head of that movement was in London ?
Stephen Fisher . what ?
you mean the man who ran the Universal Peace Party ?
Yes , the same Mr. Fisher who was drowned a few hours ago .
he was using the Peace Party as a cover-up for spies and traitors .
he was going to be arrested and sent back to England .
those are facts . I can &apos;t believe it .
he was a friend of mine .
the same Stephen Fisher who engineered the kidnapping of Van Meer , the Dutch diplomat .
you don &apos;t expect anybody to believe that .
it &apos;s the truth .
- I refuse ...
- Captain , wait a minute . this young lady should know whether my friend is speaking the truth about Mr. Fisher .
Yes , I ought to know . Mr. Fisher was ... my father .
and I want the story printed .
what &apos;s that ?
Oh , I guess that &apos;s my uncle .
Oh , hello , Uncle . how are you ? how &apos;s Aunt Sadie ?
I &apos;m all right , thanks .
we had a little accident , but I can &apos;t tell you about it now .
I &apos;ll write you . Yes , I &apos;m going back to Europe . I was wondering if you had any instructions for me .
Yes . keep on the job .
have you got all that ?
rush it out at once .
we have as a guest tonight ... one of the soldiers of the press ... one of the little army of historians writing history ... from beside the cannon &apos;s mouth ... the foreign correspondent of the New York Globe , Huntley Haverstock .
Hello , America .
I &apos;ve been watching a part of the world being blown to pieces .
a part of the world as nice as Vermont and Ohio ... and Virginia and California and Illinois ... lies ripped up and bleeding like a steer in a slaughterhouse .
I &apos;ve seen things that make the history of the savages read like Pollyanna legends ... it &apos;s a raid .
we shall have to postpone the broadcast .
- Let &apos;s go on as long as we can .
- We have a shelter downstairs . how about it , Carol ?
- They &apos;re listening in America , Johnny .
we &apos;ll tell them , then .
I can &apos;t read the rest of the speech ... the lights have gone out ... so I &apos;ll just have to talk off the cuff .
all that noise you hear isn &apos;t static . it &apos;s death coming to London .
they &apos;re coming now .
you can hear the bombs falling on the streets and homes .
don &apos;t tune me out .
this is a big story , and you &apos;re part of it .
it &apos;s too late to do anything here except stand in the dark and let them come .
it &apos;s as if the lights were all out everywhere ... except in America .
keep those lights burning .
cover them with steel , ring them with guns ... build a canopy of battleships and bombing planes around them .
Hello , America ! hang on to your lights .
they &apos;re the only lights left in the world .
♪ And the rockets &apos; red glare ♪ ♪ The bombs bursting in air ♪
- When you be back , Roy ? - Oh , in a couple of weeks .
- Don &apos;t do nothin &apos; you wouldn &apos;t want me to hear about .
- Well , so long ! - So long !
how about a lift , mister ? - Can &apos;t you see that sticker ?
- Sure , I see it ... but a good guy don &apos;t pay no attention to what some heel makes him stick on his truck .
well , scrunch down on the running board till we get around the bend .
- Nah , just a couple of miles .
I &apos;d have walked &apos; er if my dogs wasn &apos;t pooped out .
- Looking for a job ? - No .
my old man &apos;s got a place ... 40 acres .
he &apos;s a sharecropper , but we been there a long while .
- Been doin &apos; the job ? - Yeah .
I seen your hands .
you been swingin &apos; a pick or a sledge . that &apos;s what makes them shiny .
I notice little things like that all the time .
got a trade ? - Why don &apos;t you get at it , buddy ?
- Get at what ?
you know what I &apos;m talking about .
you been goin &apos; over me ever since I got in . - Why don &apos;t you ask me where I &apos;ve been ?
- I don &apos;t stick my nose in anybody &apos;s business .
- Nah , not much ! - I stay in my own yard .
that big nose of yours has been goin &apos; over me like a sheep in a vegetable patch .
well , I ain &apos;t keeping &apos; it a secret .
I been in the penitentiary ... - Been there four years .
anything else you want to know ? - You ain &apos;t gotta get sore . - Go ahead .
ask me anything .
- I didn &apos;t mean nothin &apos; .
me , neither .
I &apos;m just trying to get along without shoving anybody , that &apos;s all . see that road ahead ?
that &apos;s where I get out .
you &apos;re about to bust a gut to know what I done , ain &apos;t you ?
well , I ain &apos;t a guy to let you down .
homicide .
* Mm-mmm , He &apos;s my savior *
* Mmm , mmm , mmm , my savior *
* Mmm , mmm , mmm my savior now * *
- Howdy , friend . - Howdy .
say , ain &apos;t you young Tom Joad , old Tom &apos;s boy ? Yeah .
I &apos;m on my way home now .
well , I do declare . I baptized you , son .
ain &apos;t you the preacher ?
used to be . not no more .
I lost the call .
but , boy , I sure used to have it .
I used to get an irrigation ditch so squirming &apos; full of repented sinners ...
I &apos;d pretty near drown half of &apos;em .
but not no more .
I lost the spirit .
I got nothin &apos; to preach about no more , that &apos;s all .
I ain &apos;t so sure of things .
I remember you preachin &apos; a whole sermon ... walkin &apos; around on your hands , shouting &apos; your head off .
Yeah , I remember . went pretty good that way .
but that was nothin &apos; .
why , I preached a whole sermon once straddling &apos; the ridgepole of a barn ... like this .
- You see that one ? - No . - You see that one ?
you didn &apos;t ?
well , it &apos;s all gone , anyway .
you should &apos;ve got yourself a wife .
why , at my meetings , I used to get the girls a-glory-shoutin &apos; till they about pass out .
then I &apos;d go to comfort &apos; em .
I &apos;d always end up by lovin &apos; &apos; em .
I &apos;d feel bad and pray and pray , but it didn &apos;t do no good . next time , do it again .
I figured I just wasn &apos;t worth savin &apos; .
Pa always says you was never cut out for no preacher .
I never let one get by me if I could catch her . have a snort ?
but you wasn &apos;t a preacher !
a girl was just a girl to you .
to me , they &apos;s holy vessels .
I was savin &apos; their souls .
I asked myself , what is this here called &quot; Holy Spirit &quot; ?
maybe that &apos;s love .
why , I love everybody so much ...
I &apos;m fit to bust sometimes !
so maybe there ain &apos;t no sin and there ain &apos;t no virtue .
it &apos;s just what people does .
some things folks do is nice and some ain &apos;t so nice .
and that &apos;s all any man &apos;s got a right to say .
of course , I &apos;ll say a grace if somebody sets out the food ... but my heart ain &apos;t in it .
- Nice drinking &apos; liquor .
- Yeah , it ought to be . that &apos;s factory liquor . cost me a buck .
you been out traveling &apos; around ? Oh , ain &apos;t you heard ?
it &apos;s been in the papers .
- No , I never . what ?
- I been in the penitentiary for four years .
Oh , excuse me for askin &apos; .
I don &apos;t mind no more . I &apos;d do what I done again .
killed a guy in a dance hall .
we was drunk , he got a knife in me and I laid him out with a shovel .
knocked his head plumb to squash . - You ain &apos;t ashamed ?
- Nah . he had a knife in me ...
that &apos;s why they only give me seven years .
I got out in four ... parole .
- Ain &apos;t seen your folks since ?
- No , but I aim to &apos; fore sundown .
and I &apos;m gettin &apos; excited about it too .
which way you goin &apos; ?
Oh , it don &apos;t matter .
ever since I lost the spirit , I &apos;d ... it looks like I &apos;d just as soon go one way as the other .
I &apos;ll go your way .
maybe Ma &apos;ll have pork for supper .
I ain &apos;t had pork but four times in four years ... every Christmas .
I &apos;ll be glad to see your pa .
last time I seen him was at a baptizing &apos; .
he had one of the biggest doses of the Holy Spirit I ever seen .
got to jumpin &apos; over bushes , howlin &apos; like a dog-wolf at moon time .
finally , he picks hisself out a bush big as a piano .
and he lets out a squawk and takes a run at that bush .
well , he cleared her ... but he busted his leg snap &apos; n two doin &apos; it .
there was a travelin &apos; dentist there and he set her ... and I give her a prayin &apos; over ... but there wasn &apos;t no more Holy Spirit left in your pa after that .
listen .
that wind &apos;s fixin &apos;to do somethin &apos; . sure , it is .
always is this time of year .
ma ?
Pa ?
ma ?
ain &apos;t nobody here ? something &apos;s happened .
you got a match ?
they &apos;re all gone or dead .
- They never wrote you nothin &apos; ? - Nah , they wasn &apos;t people to write .
it &apos;s Ma &apos;s . she had &apos; em for years .
used to be mine . I give it to Grandpa when I went away .
you reckon they &apos;re dead ?
I never heard nothin &apos; about it .
Tommy ?
where &apos;s my folks , Muley ?
- Why , they gone .
I know they &apos;re gone , but where they gone ? it &apos;s Muley Graves .
you remember the preacher , don &apos;t you ? - I ain &apos;t no preacher anymore .
- All right .
you remember the man , don &apos;t you ? - Glad to see you again .
- Glad to see you .
- Now , where are my folks ?
- They gone .
they gone to your UncleJohn &apos;s ...
the whole crowd of &apos;em ... two weeks ago .
but they can &apos;t stay there either , &apos; causeJohn &apos;s got his notice to get off . well , what happened ?
how come they got to get off ?
we lived here 50 years , same place .
everybody &apos;s got to get off .
everybody &apos;s leavin &apos; , goin &apos; out to California .
your folks , my folks , everybody &apos;s folks . everybody except me .
I ain &apos;t gettin &apos; off .
who done it ? listen .
that &apos;s some of what done it . the dusters .
they started it , anyways .
blowin &apos; like this year after year .
blowin &apos; the land away , blowin &apos; the crops away ... and blowin &apos; us away now !
you crazy ?
some say I am . - You want to hear how it happened ?
- That &apos;s what I &apos;m askin &apos; you , ain &apos;t it ?
well , the way it happens ... the way it happened to me ... a man come one day ... a man come one day ...
fact of the matter , Muley , after what them dusters done to the land ... the tenant system don &apos;t work no more .
you don &apos;t even break even , much less show a profit .
why , one man and a tractor can handle 12 or 14 of these places .
you just pay him a wage and take all the crop .
Yeah , but we couldn &apos;t do on any less than what our share is now .
well , the children ain &apos;t gettin &apos; enough to eat as it is .
and they &apos;re so ragged ...
we &apos;d be ashamed if everybody else &apos;s children wasn &apos;t the same way . I can &apos;t help that .
all I know is I got my orders .
they told me to tell you to get off , and that &apos;s what I &apos;m tellin &apos; ya .
you mean get off my own land ? now , don &apos;t go to blaming &apos; me .
it ain &apos;t my fault . - Whose fault is it ?
- You know who owns the land ...
the Shawnee Land and Cattle Company .
- And who &apos;s the Shawnee Land and Cattle Company ? - It ain &apos;t nobody .
it &apos;s a company .
they got a president , ain &apos;t they ?
they got somebody that knows what a shotgun &apos;s for , ain &apos;t they ?
Oh , son , it ain &apos;t his fault , because the bank tells him what to do .
all right , where &apos;s the bank ? Tulsa . and what &apos;s the use of pickin &apos; on him ?
he ain &apos;t nothin &apos; but the manager , and he &apos;s half crazy hisself ... tryin &apos; to keeping &apos; up with his orders from the East .
- Then who do we shoot ? - Brother , I don &apos;t know .
if I did , I &apos;d tell you .
I just don &apos;t know who &apos;s to blame .
well , I &apos;m right here to tell you , mister , there ain &apos;t nobody gonna push me off my land !
my grandpa took up this land 70 years ago ! my pa was born here !
we was all born on it !
and some of us was killed on it !
and some of us ... died on it .
and that &apos;s what makes it our &apos;n ... bein &apos; born on it ... and workin &apos; on it ... and dyin &apos; ... dyin &apos; on it !
and not no piece of paper with writing &apos; on it ...
well , what happened ?
they come . they come and pushed me off .
- They come with the Cats . - The what ?
the Cats .
the Caterpillar tractors .
and for every one of &apos;em ... there was 10 , 15 families throwed right out of their homes .
a hundred folks and no place to live but on the road .
the Rances , the Peterses , the Perrys , theJoads .
one right after the other , they got throwed out .
half the folks you and me know throwed right out into the road .
the one that got me come , oh , about a month ago . - Go on back !
go on back ! - Tell &apos; em , Muley .
I &apos;m warnin &apos; you , go on back !
you come any closer and I &apos;m gonna blow you right out of that Cat !
I told you . !
why , you &apos;reJoe Davis &apos;s boy !
I don &apos;t like for nobody to draw a bead on me .
then what are you doin &apos; a thing like this for , against your own people ? $ 3.00 a day ...
that &apos;s what I &apos;m doin &apos; it for .
I got two little kids at home , my wife , my wife &apos;s mother .
them folks got to eat . first and only , I think about my own folks .
what happen to other people ... their own lookout .
Yeah , but you don &apos;t understand , son .
this is my land !
used to be your land . it &apos;s the company &apos;s now .
have it your own way , son ... but just as sure as you touch my house with that Cat ...
I &apos;m gonna blow you plumb to kingdom come !
you ain &apos;t gonna blow nobody nowhere .
first place , they &apos;d hang you , and you know it .
for another , it wouldn &apos;t be two days &apos; fore they &apos;d send another guy up here to take my place . now , go on !
get out of the way !
what was the use ?
he was right , and there wasn &apos;t a thing in the world I could do about it .
just , it don &apos;t seem possible , just gettin &apos; throwed off like that .
the rest of my family set out for the West .
there wasn &apos;t nothing to eat , but I couldn &apos;t leave .
somethin &apos;just wouldn &apos;t let me .
so now I just wander around and sleep wherever I am .
I used to tell myself that I was lookin &apos; out for things ... so that when the folks come back , everything &apos;d be all right .
but I knowed it wasn &apos;t true .
there ain &apos;t nothin &apos; to look out for ... and there ain &apos;t nobody ever comin &apos; back .
they &apos;re gone !
and me , I &apos;m just an old graveyard ghost .
that &apos;s all in the world I am !
do you think I &apos;m touched ?
no .
you &apos;re lonely , but ... you ain &apos;t touched .
well , it don &apos;t matter .
if I &apos;m touched , I &apos;m touched , and that &apos;s all there is to it .
thing I don &apos;t understand is my folks taking it . like Ma .
I seen her nearly beat a peddler to death with a live chicken .
she aimed to go for him with the ax she had in her other hand .
she got mixed up , forgot which was which ... and when she got through with that peddler , all she had left was two chicken legs .
just a ... Just a plain , old graveyard ghost .
that &apos;s all .
she &apos;s settling &apos; .
what do you figure on doin &apos; ?
Ah , it &apos;s hard to say .
stay here till morning . go to UncleJohn &apos;s , I reckon .
after that , I don &apos;t know .
listen .
that &apos;s them ... them lights . come on !
come on ! we got to hide out .
hide out for what ? we ain &apos;t doin &apos; nothin &apos; .
well , you &apos;re trespassing , Tom !
this ain &apos;t your land no more , and that &apos;s the superintendent with a gun . come on !
come on , Tom .
you &apos;re on parole .
Muley !
all you got to do is hide and watch .
- Won &apos;t they come out here ? - I don &apos;t think so .
- One came out once and I clipped him from behi ...
behind with-with a fence stake .
they ain &apos;t bothered since .
he ain &apos;t here .
if anybody ever told me I &apos;d be hiding out at my own place ...
Lord , make us grateful for what we are about to receive for His sake . amen . I seen you .
you ate during &apos; grace . just one little dab ! just one teeny little dab , that &apos;s all !
ain &apos;t he messy , though ?
I seen him , gobbling &apos; away like an old pig !
why don &apos;t you keep your eyes shut during &apos; grace , you old ...
what &apos;s it say again , UncleJohn ?
it says , &quot; Plenty of work in California . 800 pickers wanted . &quot;
wait till I get to California !
I &apos;m gonna reach up and pick me an orange whenever I want it ! or some grapes !
now ... Now-Now-Now , there &apos;s somethin &apos; I ain &apos;t never had enough of .
I &apos;m gonna get me a whole big bunch of grapes off of the bush ... and I &apos;m gonna squash them all over my face ... and let the juice drain down off of my chin .
praise the Lord for vittery !
M-M-M-Maybe I &apos;ll get me a whole washtub full of grapes ... and just sit in &apos; em and scrounge around in &apos; em until they &apos;re all gone .
I sure would like that .
Yes , sir , I sure would like that . Yeah .
Oh , thank God ! thank God !
Tommy . !
ma .
you didn &apos;t bust out , did you ?
you ain &apos;t gotta hide , have ya ?
no , Ma , I &apos;m paroled . I was so scared we was goin &apos; away without you ... and we &apos;d never see each other again .
I &apos;d have found you , Ma .
Muley told me what happened .
you goin &apos; to California true ?
Oh , we got to go , Tommy , but it &apos;s gonna be all right .
I seen the handbills about how much work they is and high wages too .
there &apos;s somethin &apos; I gotta find out first , Tommy .
did they hurt you , son ?
did they hurt you and make you mean mad ?
- Mad , Ma ?
- Sometimes they do . no , Ma .
I was at first , but not no more .
sometimes they do somethin &apos; to you .
they hurt you and you get mad and then you get mean .
then they hurt you again and you get meaner and meaner ... till you ain &apos;t no boy nor man anymore ... just a walkin &apos; chunk of mean mad .
did they hurt you that way , son ?
no , Ma , don &apos;t worry about that .
well , I ... I don &apos;t want no mean son .
- It &apos;s Tommy !
it &apos;s Tommy back ! - Tommy . ! - What &apos;d you do , son , bust out ?
- * Tommy &apos;s out of jail *
- * Tommy &apos;s out of jail , Tommy &apos;s out of ... * * - l ... I knowed it !

I knowed it from the first !

I told you !
Tom &apos;d come bustin &apos; out of that jail just like a bull through a corral fence !
- You can &apos;t keep a Joad in jail ! - I didn &apos;t bust out .
they paroled me .

Yes , my ... my dirt .

- Reckon we could get him drunk ?
- Ain &apos;t no whiskey , is there ?
now , wait . they &apos;s a half a bottle of soothing &apos; syrup here .

- Don &apos;t taste bad . - There &apos;s some coffee left . we can fix him a cup .
that &apos;s right , and douse some in it .
better give him a good dose . he &apos;s mighty muleheaded .
if Muley ...
if Muley can scrabble along , I ...
I guess I can .
I smell spareribs . huh .
somebody &apos;s been eatin &apos; spareribs .
how come I ain &apos;t got none ?
well , I got some saved for you , Grandpa . got some a-warmin &apos; now . - Eh ?
- But here &apos;s a cup of coffee for you first .

I &apos;m-I &apos;m hungry .

- Well , good-bye and good luck . - Hold it , Al !
- Ain &apos;t you goin &apos; with us ? - I &apos;d like to .
there &apos;s somethin &apos; goin &apos; on out there in the West ... and I &apos;d like to try and learn what it is ... if you feel you got the room .
- Mmm . - Plenty of room ! get on !
- Hop on , Casy !
- Let her go , Al !
- California , here we come ! - You kids ...
ain &apos;t you gonna look back , Ma ?
give the old place a last look ?
we &apos;re goin &apos; to California , ain &apos;t we ? all right , then , let &apos;s go to California .
that don &apos;t sound like you , Ma . you never was like that before .
I never had my house pushed over before .
never had my family stuck out in the road ... never had to lose everything I had in life .
- I ain &apos;t goin &apos; .
- It &apos;s gonna be all right , Grandpa .
- That &apos;s good right there , Ma . - I ain &apos;t goin &apos; !
I ain &apos;t goin &apos; .
I ain &apos;t goin &apos; . I ain &apos;t ... I ain &apos;t a-goin &apos; .
it &apos;s all right , Grandpa .
you &apos;re just tired , that &apos;s all .
that &apos;s it ...
just tired .
just ... tired .
&quot; this here is William James Joad , died of a stroke .
&quot; old , old man .
&quot; his folks buried him because they got no money ... to pay for funeral ... &quot; Sss ...
&quot; nobody killed him . just a stroke and he died . &quot;
figure best we leave something like this on him ...
- unless somebody digs him up , makes out he was killed . - Hmm .
looks like a lot of times the government &apos;s got more interest ... in a dead man than a live one .
not be so lonesome , knowin &apos; his name &apos;s there with him .
not just an old fella lonesome underground .
won &apos;t you say a few words , Casy ?
I ain &apos;t a preacher no more , you know .
we know , but ain &apos;t none of our folks ever been buried without a few words .
I &apos;ll say &apos; em , make it short .
this here old man just lived a life and just died out of it .
I don &apos;t know whether he was good or bad .
it don &apos;t matter much .
heard a fella say a poem once ... and he says , &quot; All that lives is holy . &quot;
well , I wouldn &apos;t pray just for an old man that &apos;s dead , &apos; cause he &apos;s all right .
if I was to pray , I &apos;d pray for folks that &apos;s alive and don &apos;t know which way to turn .
Grandpa here , he ain &apos;t got no more trouble like that .
he &apos;s got his job all cut out for him , so ... cover him up and let him get to it .
* I &apos;m goin &apos; down the road feelin &apos; bad *
* I &apos;m goin &apos; down the road feelin &apos; bad * * I &apos;m goin &apos; down the road feelin &apos; bad *
* Oh , Lordy *
* I ain &apos;t a-gonna be
* A-treated this a-way
* They fed me on corn bread and beans
* They fed me on corn bread and beans
huh . gosh .
Connie sure sings pretty , don &apos;t he ?
* Oh , Lordy
* I ain &apos;t a-gonna be a-treated this a-way * *
- That &apos;s my son-in-law . - Sings real nice .
- What state you all from ?
- Oklahoma .
had us a farm there , sharecroppin &apos; .
we &apos;re from Arkansas .
had me a store there ... kind of a general notions store .
when the farms went , the stores went too .
I had as nice a little store as you ever saw .
I sure did hate to give it up .
well , you can &apos;t tell .
I figure when we get out there and get work ... and maybe get us a piece of growing &apos; land near water , it might not be so bad at that .
that &apos;s right . payin &apos; good wages , I hear .
- We can all get work . - Can &apos;t be no worse than home .
you all must have a pot of money .
no , we ain &apos;t got no money ... but there &apos;s plenty of us to work , and we &apos;re all good men .
get good wages out there and put it all together , and we &apos;ll be all right .
good wages , eh ?
pickin &apos; oranges and peaches ?
- Well , we aim to take whatever they got .
- What &apos;s so funny about that ?
what &apos;s so funny about it ?
I &apos;ve just been out there . I &apos;ve been and seen it .
I &apos;m goin &apos; back and starve , because I &apos;d rather starve all over at once .
say , what do you think you &apos;re talkin &apos; about ?
I got a handbill here says they &apos;re payin &apos; good wages .
and I seen the papers that they need pickers .
all right , go on . nobody &apos;s stoppin &apos; ya .
- Yeah , but what about this ?
- I ain &apos;t gonna rile ya . go on .
what a minute , buddy . you just done some jackassin &apos; . you can &apos;t shut up now .
the handbill says they need 800 pickers .
you laugh and say they don &apos;t . which one &apos;s the liar ?
how many of you all got them handbills ?
- I got one .
- Come on . how many ?
- I got one . - We all got one .
what does that prove ?
there you are ... same yellow handbill .
&quot; 700 pickers wanted . &quot;
all right .
the man wants 700 men ... so he prints 5,000 handbills , and maybe 20,000 people see them ... and maybe two or three thousand people start west on account of that handbill .
two or three thousand people that are crazy with worry ... heading out for 700 jobs .
- Now , does that make sense ?
- Say , what are you , a troublemaker ?
you sure you ain &apos;t one of them labor fakes ?
l ... I swear I ain &apos;t , mister .
well , don &apos;t you go around here trying to stir up any trouble .
I tried to tell you folks what it took me a year to find out .
took two kids dead , took my wife dead to show me ... but nobody could tell me , neither .
I can &apos;t tell you about them little fellas laying &apos; in their tent ... with their bellies swelled out and just skin over their bones ... a-shiverin &apos;and a-whinin &apos;like pups .
and me a-runnin &apos;around lookin &apos;for work ... not for money , not for wages ... just for a cup offlour and a spoon oflard .
then the coroner come .
&quot; them children died of heart failure , &quot; he said . he put it down on his paper .
heart failure ?
and their little bellies stuck out like a pig bladder ?
well , guess we gotta get some sleep .
well , good night , folks .
suppose he &apos;s tellin &apos; the truth , that fella ?
he &apos;s tellin &apos; the truth ... the truth for him .
he wasn &apos;t makin &apos; it up .
was it the truth for us ?
I don &apos;t know .
- I got to get out .
- Okay .
I got to get out now . !
- You folks aim to buy anything ?
- We want some gas , mister .
- Got any money ?
- What do you think ? we &apos;re beggin &apos; ?
I just asked , that &apos;s all .
well , ask right . you ain &apos;t talkin &apos; to bums , you know .
all in the world I done was asked .
- Banana cream , pineapple cream ... chocolate cream and apple .
cut me off a hunk of that banana cream . and a cup of java .
- Make it two .
- Two it is .
seen any good etchings lately , Bill ?
well , this one ain &apos;t bad . a little kid comes late for school , and the teacher says ...
cheese it .

- Need a lot of fruit pickers .
- You doin &apos; the hiring &apos; ?
well , I &apos;m contracting &apos; the land .
- What ya paying &apos; ?
- Well , can &apos;t tell exactly yet .
- About 30 cents , I guess .
- Why can &apos;t you tell ?
- You took the contract , didn &apos;t you ?
- That &apos;s true . but it &apos;s keyed to the price . might be a little more , might be a little less .
all right , mister . I &apos;ll go .
you just show us your license to contract ... then you make out a order ... where and when and how much you gonna pay ...
- and you sign it , and we &apos;ll go .
- Now , listen , smart guy .
I &apos;ll run my business my own way .
I got work . if you want to take it , okay .
if not , just sit here , that &apos;s all .
twice now , I fell for that line .
maybe he needs a thousand men .
so he get &apos;s 5,000 there , and he &apos;ll pay 15 cents an hour .
and you guys &apos;ll have to take it , because you &apos;ll be hungry .
if he wants to hire men , let him write it out and say what he &apos;s gonna pay .
ask to see his license .
he ain &apos;t allowed by law to contract men without a license .
Hey , Joe .
agitator .

Yep , that &apos;s the fella . get in this car .

maybe he figured to surprise us .
maybe that &apos;s just what he done .
- Ma , they comes a time when a man gets mad .
- You told me ... - You promised me you wasn &apos;t like that , Tom .
- Ma .
I &apos;m a-tryin &apos; to . if it was the law they was workin &apos; with , maybe we could take it . but it ain &apos;t the law !
they &apos;re workin &apos; away at our spirits . they &apos;re tryin &apos; to make us cringe and crawl ...

Pa , let &apos;s try that other tire . - You got another flat tire , Tom ?
- What , another one ?
- Pa , get that cheviot from back there .
- All right .

it &apos;s gonna be heavy enough .

well , I ain &apos;t full .
well , tomorrow you &apos;ll get in a full day &apos;s work and a full day &apos;s pay .
and then , we &apos;ll all have enough .
you wouldn &apos;t think just reaching &apos; up and pickin &apos; would get you in the back .
think I &apos;ll walk out and find out what all that fuss outside the gate was .
- Somebody come with me ? - No .
I think I &apos;ll set awhile then go to bed .
think I &apos;ll look around and see if I can &apos;t meet me a girl .
- Girl ?
Hey , when I was your age ...
- Pa ! thing &apos;s been workin &apos; on me , what all that yelling &apos; was about .
- Got me all curious .
- Pick up , Winfield .
I &apos;ll be back in a little while .
Tom . now , you be careful .
- Don &apos;t you go sticking &apos; your nose in anything .
- Okay , Ma . don &apos;t worry .
where do you think you &apos;re goin &apos; ?
I thought I &apos;d take a walk . any law against that ?
well , you can just turn around and walk back .
- You mean I can &apos;t even get out of here ?
- Not tonight you can &apos;t .
now do you want to walk back ... or shall I whistle up some help and have you taken back ?
I &apos;ll walk back .
- Evenin &apos; .
- Who are you ?
- Just goin &apos; past , that &apos;s all .
- Know anybody around here ?
no . just goin &apos; past , I tell ya .
- Casy !
- Well , if it ain &apos;t Tom Joad !
Hiya , boy !
I thought you was in jail .
no . they just run me out of town . come on in .
Tom Joad .
- Is this the fella you been talkin &apos; about ?
- That &apos;s him .
- What are you doin &apos; here , Tom ?
- Workin &apos; pickin &apos; peaches .
I heard some fellas shoutin &apos; when we come in .
I come out to find out what &apos;s goin &apos; on . what &apos;s it all about ?
- This here &apos;s a strike .
- Well , five cents a box ain &apos;t much , but a fella can eat .
five cents ?
they paying &apos; you five cents ?
- Sure . we made a buck since midday .
- Lookee , Tom ... we come here to work .
they tell us there &apos;s gonna be five cents , but there &apos;s a whole lot of us ... so the man says 21 / 2 cents .
well , a fella can &apos;t even eat on that , and if he &apos;s got kids ...
so we says we won &apos;t take it , so they drive us off .
now they &apos;re payin &apos; you five cents . but if they bust this strike , you think they &apos;ll pay five ?
don &apos;t know . payin &apos; five now .
they &apos;ll get 21 / 2 cents just the minute we &apos;re gone .
you know what that is ... one ton of peaches picked and carried for a dollar .
that way , you can &apos;t even buy enough food to keep you alive .
tell &apos; em to come out with us , Tom .
them peaches is ripe !
two days out and they &apos;ll pay us ... pay us all five , maybe seven .
no , they won &apos;t . they &apos;re gettin &apos; five now . that &apos;s all they care about .
but the moment they ain &apos;t strikebreakin &apos; , they won &apos;t get no five .
next thing you know , you &apos;ll be out . they got it all fixed down to a T .
well , soon as the harvest is in , you &apos;re a migrant worker .
afterwards , just a bum .
five they &apos;re gettin &apos; now , that &apos;s all they &apos;re interested in .
I know exactly what Pa would say . he &apos;d just say it &apos;s none of his business .
guess that &apos;s right . he &apos;ll have to take a beatin &apos; before he &apos;ll know .
take a beatin &apos; ?
we was out of food !
tonight we had meat . not much , but we had it .
you think Pa &apos;s gonna give up his meat on ... on account of some other fellas ?
Rosasharn needs milk .
you think Ma &apos;s gonna starve that baby ... just on account of fellas yellin &apos; outside a gate ?
Tom , you gotta learn like I &apos;m learnin &apos; .
I don &apos;t know it right yet myself , but I &apos;m tryin &apos; to find out .
that &apos;s why I can &apos;t ever be a preacher again .
Preachers gotta know .
I don &apos;t know . I gotta ask .
- I don &apos;t like it .
- What &apos;s the matter ?
I can &apos;t tell . it seems as though l-I hear somethin &apos; .
then when I listen , there ain &apos;t nothin &apos; to hear .
well , it ain &apos;t out of the question , you know . we &apos;re all a little itchy . cops been tellin &apos; us how they &apos;re gonna beat us up .
not them regular deputies , but them tin-shield men , the ones they got for guards .
they figure I &apos;m the leader &apos; cause I talk so much .
- What is it ?
- I don &apos;t know . listen .
can &apos;t tell whether you hear it or not . you hear it , Tom ?
I hear it .
I think it &apos;s some guys comin &apos; this way , a lot of &apos;em .
- We got to get out of here .
- Down that way , under the bridge span . !
there he is , The one in the middle . !
the skinny one . ! get him . !
listen , you fellas , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doin &apos; !
- You &apos;re helpin &apos; to starve kids ! - Ah , shut up , you dirty ...
- You &apos;ve killed him !
- Serves him right too .
look out !
boy , he &apos;s good and dead . did you see the fella that done it ?
I ain &apos;t sure , but I caught him one across the face .
he &apos;ll have a trademark he won &apos;t be able to get rid of .
- Ma ?
- Tom . Tom .
Pa , wake up .
Al , hit the light . Shh .
all right , Ma .
pick him up . hurry . come on .
is he gonna be all right ?
- Anybody ask anything ?
- No , ma &apos;am .
- You stay by that door .
- Yes , ma &apos;am .
Tommy .
how does it feel ?
busted my cheek , but I can still see .
- What &apos;d you hear ?
- Looks like you done it .
I thought so . it felt like it .
folks ain &apos;t talkin &apos; about much else .
they say they got posses out .
talkin &apos; about a lynchin &apos; when they catch the fella .
they killed Casy first .
that ain &apos;t the way they &apos;re tellin &apos; it .
they &apos;re sayin &apos; you done it first .
do they know ...
what the fella looks like ?
they know he got hit in the face .
I &apos;m sorry , Ma .
I didn &apos;t know what I was doin &apos; any more than when you take a breath .
I didn &apos;t even know I was gonna do it .
Oh , it &apos;s all right , Tommy .
I wished you didn &apos;t do it ... but you done what you had to do .
and I can &apos;t read no fault in you .
I &apos;m goin &apos; away tonight , Ma . I can &apos;t go puttin &apos; this on you folks .
Tom , there &apos;s a whole lot I don &apos;t understand ... but goin &apos; away ain &apos;t gonna ease us .
there was a time we was on the land .
there was a boundary to us then .
old folks died off and little fellers come .
we was always one thing .
we was the family ... kind of whole and clear .

*

Oklahoma . EL-204 .
you have no right to arrest anybody without a warrant , you know .
we &apos;ll have a warrant just as soon as we check with headquarters .
Tommy .
ain &apos;t you gonna tell me good-bye ?
I didn &apos;t know , Ma . I didn &apos;t know if I ought to .
- Ma .
- Hush , Ruthie .
come outside .
there was some cops here tonight .
they was takin &apos; down license numbers .
I guess somebody knows somethin &apos; .
I guess it had to come , sooner or later .
sit down for a minute .
I &apos;d like to stay , Ma . I &apos;d like to stay , Ma .
I &apos;d like to be with you and see your face ... when you and Pa get settled in some nice place .
I &apos;d sure like to see you then ... but I won &apos;t never get that chance , I guess , now .
- I could hide you , Tommy .
- I know you would , Ma , but I ain &apos;t gonna let you .
you hide somebody that &apos;s killed a guy and you &apos;re in trouble too .
all right , Tommy .
but what do you figure you &apos;re gonna do ?
you know what I been thinkin &apos; about ?
about Casy ... about what he said ... what he done ... about how he died ... and I remember all of it .
he was a good man .
I been thinkin &apos; about us too ... about our people livin &apos; like pigs ... and good , rich land laying &apos; fallow ... or maybe one guy with a million acres ... and 100,000 farmers starving &apos; .
and I been wonderin &apos; if ... all our folks got together and yelled ...
Oh , Tommy , they &apos;d drive you out and cut you down just like they done to Casy .
they &apos;re gonna drive me , anyways .
sooner or later they &apos;d get me for one thing if not for another .
until then ...
Tommy , you &apos;re not aimin &apos; to kill nobody ?
no , Ma , not that . that ain &apos;t it .
it &apos;s just ... well , as long as I &apos;m an outlaw anyways ... maybe I can do somethin &apos; .
maybe I can just find out somethin &apos; ... just scrounge around ... and maybe find out what it is that &apos;s wrong ... and then see if there ain &apos;t somethin &apos; that can be done about it .
I ain &apos;t thought it all out clear , Ma .
l ... I can &apos;t .
I don &apos;t know enough .
well , how am I gonna know about you , Tommy ?
why , they could kill you and I &apos;d never know .
they could hurt you . how am I gonna know ?
well , maybe it &apos;s like Casy says ...
fella ain &apos;t got a soul of his own ... just a little piece of a big soul ... the one big soul that belongs to everybody .
- Then ...
- Then what , Tom ?
then it don &apos;t matter .
I &apos;ll be all around in the dark .
I &apos;ll be everywhere , wherever you can look .
wherever there &apos;s a fight so hungry people can eat ...
I &apos;ll be there .
wherever there &apos;s a cop beatin &apos; up a guy ...
I &apos;ll be there .
I &apos;ll be in the way guys yell when they &apos;re mad .
I &apos;ll be in the way kids laugh when they &apos;re hungry ... and they know supper &apos;s ready .
and when the people are eatin &apos; the stuff they raise ... and livin &apos; in the houses they build ...
I &apos;ll be there too .
I don &apos;t understand it , Tom .
Oh , me neither , Ma , but ... it &apos;s just somethin &apos; I been thinkin &apos; about .
give me your hand , Ma .
- Good-bye .
- Good-bye , Tommy .
later , when this has blowed over ... you &apos;ll come back ?
sure , Ma .
Tom , we ... we ain &apos;t the kissing &apos; kind , but ...
Good-bye , Ma .
Good-bye , Tommy .
Tommy .
- Good-bye . - Good-bye .

Bye .

Twenty days &apos; work . Oh , boy !
I &apos;ll be glad to get my hands on some cotton .
that &apos;s the kind of pickin &apos; I understand .
maybe . maybe 20 days &apos; work and maybe no days &apos; work .
we ain &apos;t got it till we get it .
what &apos;s the matter , Ma , you gettin &apos; scared ?
scared , huh !
I ain &apos;t never gonna be scared no more .
I was , though .
for a while , it looked as though we was beat , good and beat .
looked like we didn &apos;t have nobody in the whole wide world but enemies ... like nobody was friendly no more .
made me feel kind of bad and scared too ... like we was lost and nobody cared .
you are the one that keeps us goin &apos; , Ma .
I ain &apos;t no good no more , and I know it .
seems like I spend all my time these days thinkin &apos; how it used to be ...
- Mm-hmm . - Thinkin &apos; of home .
I ain &apos;t never gonna see it no more .
well , Pa , a woman can change better than a man .
a man lives sorta , well , in jerks .
baby &apos;s born or somebody dies and that &apos;s a jerk .
he gets a farm or loses it and that &apos;s a jerk .
with a woman , it &apos;s all in one flow like a stream ... little eddies and waterfalls ... but the river , it goes right on .
a woman looks at it that way .
well , maybe , but we sure taking &apos; a beatin &apos; .
I know . that &apos;s what makes us tough .
rich fellas come up and they die .
their kids ain &apos;t no good and they die out , but we keep a-comin &apos; .
we &apos;re the people that live .
they can &apos;t wipe us out . they can &apos;t lick us .
and we &apos;ll go on forever , Pa , &apos; cause we &apos;re the people .
by the end of the World War Tomainia weakened .
revolution had broken out , her diplomats sued for peace while Tomainia &apos;s army fought on , confident its war machine would smash the enemy &apos;s lines .
big Bertha , able to fire 100 miles , was to make its appearance on the Western Front , and strike terror into the enemy .
75 miles away was her target :
the cathedral of Notre-Dame .
range : 95,452 .
stand clear !
fire !
stand by your trigger !
range correction : 95,455 .
breach secured .
stand clear .
ready ...
fire !
defective shell . we &apos;ll examine it .
check the fuse .
Yes , the fuse .
look out !
run !
what &apos;s that ?
- Air raid . - After Big Bertha .
the anti-aircraft gun !
to the gun !
have you gone crazy ?
come down !
what do you think you &apos;re doing ?
have you gone crazy ?
sir , the enemy have broken through .
every man to the front .
muster the gun crew !
get your hand grenades , soldiers .
where &apos;s your hand grenade ?
give him one .
keep moving . come along , hurry up !
pardon me , but to work this ...
pull the pin , count to ten and throw it !
let them have it !
this is no time to scratch .
pull yourself together .
take this .
forward !
fall in !
Hey you , come on !
order arms !
prepare to attack .
forward !
there you are .
the enemy !
come on , let &apos;s get him !
may I come in , sir ?
- Who is it ?
- Friend .
- What division ?
- 21st artillery , sir .
take this and keep firing .
I &apos;ll be back .
comrade ! help !
what is it ?
I &apos;m exhausted .
quick , help me to my plane .
thank you . I &apos;ll see you get the Tomainian Cross for this .
only too willing to oblige , sir .
you saved my life . thank you .
I &apos;ll strap you in .
I can &apos;t make it alone . you &apos;ll have to stay with me .
can you fly ?
I can try .
lift my hand to the stick . I haven &apos;t the strength .
take charge of that gun !
the enemy !
quick , lift my hand to the throttle .
we &apos;ll fool &apos; em !
hold on to these dispatches .
if we get them to General Schmelloffel ,
Tomainia may yet win .
I &apos;m going to faint .
don &apos;t say that .
sorry .
where am I ?
don &apos;t you know me ?
Yes , I feel better now .
the blood &apos;s returning to my head .
what &apos;s below ?
the sun ?
shining upwards .
strange . how &apos;s the gas ?
kept me awake all night .
no , the gasoline in the tank !
almost empty .
we must be nearly there . what time is it ?
approximately one minute to twelve .
strange .
we seem to be defying the laws of gravity .
water . quick , I &apos;m going to faint .
wait a while .
we &apos;ll get into trouble if you faint any more .
just hold it .
I think I ...
now ...
take it !
something &apos;s wrong .
I can &apos;t reach it .
it &apos;s all gone .
what &apos;s the matter ?
belt too tight .
loosen it .
I &apos;m trying to !
we &apos;re upside down .
I know it !
the stick !
impossible .
there it goes . we &apos;re out of gas .
well , I suppose this is the end . cigarette ?
not now !
I shan &apos;t need this any more .
what month is it ?
April . spring in Tomainia .
Hilda will be in the garden , tending the daffodils .
how she loves daffodils !
she &apos;d never cut them for fear of hurting them .
it was like taking a life to cut a daffodil .
sweet , gentle Hilda .
a beautiful soul .
she loved animals , and little children , too .
we &apos;ve landed !
dispatches !
comrade , where are you ?
the dispatches ...
where are they ?
- Are you hurt ?
- Take me to General Schmelloffel .
if we don &apos;t deliver these , we &apos;re defeated .
- The war &apos;s over .
- What ?
we lost .
Hynkel takes power .
the Jewish soldier suffered a loss of memory and remained in hospital for years , ignorant of the change in Tomainia .
Hynkel ruled the nation with an iron fist .
under the double-cross emblem liberty was banished .
only the voice of Hynkel was heard .
Adenoid Hynkel said ,
&quot; Tomainia was down but today has risen . &quot;
&quot; democracy is fragrant . &quot;
&quot; liberty is odious . &quot;
&quot; freedom of speech is objectionable . &quot;
&quot; Tomainia has the greatest army . &quot;
&quot; the greatest navy . &quot;
&quot; but to remain great we must sacrifice . &quot;
&quot; we must tighten our belts . &quot;
he now speaks to Field Marshal Herring , Minister of War .
now Herr Garbitsch , Minister of the Interior .
he remembers his early struggles , shared by his two loyal comrades .
a reference to the Jewish people .
the Phooey remarks that for the world he has peace in his heart .
we now pause for station identification .
this is the Pari-Mutual network , bringing you
Hynkel &apos;s address to the children of the double-cross .
the interpreter is Hynkel &apos;s personal translator , reading from a prepared manuscript .
stand by for further commentary . go ahead , Tomainia .
his Excellency is about to descend the stairs .
your Excellency , are you hurt ?
ride in the other car .
his Excellency seems pleased as he is greeted by Tomainian children .
he pauses before a woman with a child .
camera !
even the baby is thrilled and seems all smiles at the attention .
his Excellency leaves the scene and will return along Hynkelstrasse , where he &apos;ll pass Tomainia &apos;s modern masterpieces :
the Venus of Today and the Thinker of Tomorrow .
- How was it ?
- The speech ?
very good .
your reference to the Jews might have been more violent .
what ?
to arouse the people &apos;s anger .
violence against the Jews might make the people forget their stomach .
you &apos;re right .
things have been quiet in the ghetto lately .
good morning , Mr. Jaeckel .
what &apos;s good about it ?
conditions could be worse .
if you think so , you have a great imagination .
you heard Hynkel &apos;s speech .
I heard nothing . I &apos;ve got my own troubles .
you &apos;re better off than a lot of people .
what about the barber ?
still in hospital .
he &apos;s been there since the war .
why not rent his barbershop for him ?
he won &apos;t let me .
every few weeks he writes to say he &apos;s coming back .
a pity it should be idle all these years .
why worry ?
the government will soon take it from him .
perhaps you &apos;re right . not such a good morning after all .
now you said it .
Hannah .
on the mantelpiece is my tobacco pouch . will you get it ?
everyone is full of troubles .
Yeah , everyone . look at Hannah , poor girl .
a hard worker , can &apos;t get a job .
father was killed in the war , mother died last year .
can &apos;t earn enough to pay her rent .
what can I do ?
I can &apos;t throw her out .
you need some more .
- Where are you going ?
- Mrs. Shoemaker &apos;s laundry .
you &apos;d better take the key .
Mrs. Jaeckel and I are going out .
I &apos;m locking up in case the storm troopers start their monkey business again .
Aryan !
we &apos;re Aryans !
and we go marching by !
look , fellows !
tomatoes and potatoes .
I &apos;ll take a box home .
Hey , the lorry .
hold it there , will you ?
you have no right !
just charge it to my account !
nice ripe tomatoes .
why don &apos;t some of you do something ?
if I were a man I &apos;d show you .
what would you do , pretty ?
not one of you has the guts to stand up alone and fight !
is the lorry in case someone hits back ?
shut up !
come and take me . you &apos;ll get medals for it .
you pick on women and rob defenceless people .
don &apos;t rob the poor girl , boys . give her back her tomatoes .
I &apos;ll have to do it again .
pigs !
- Patient 33 !
- Yes , sir .
an interesting case : amnesia .
Jewish soldier . been here since the war .
he thinks it &apos;s only been weeks .
does he knows what &apos;s happened ?
no .
his one interest seems to be in his barbershop , which he believes he left a few weeks ago .
he &apos;ll have many surprises .
I &apos;m afraid so .
- Yes ?
- Number 33 is gone .
he was to be examined .
but he &apos;s disappeared .
disappeared ?
let him go . it isn &apos;t a serious case .
there &apos;s little we can do for him .
come on , get out of here !
what are you doing ?
I don &apos;t know .
leave that alone .
- Don &apos;t be silly .
- I &apos;m not silly !
I appreciate that .
when you talk to me , &quot; Hail Hynkel &quot; !
who are you ?
I &apos;ll show you who I am ! come down to headquarters !
that &apos;s my shop .
I don &apos;t care if it is or not .
going to put up a fight , are you ?
come to headquarters .
let me tell you something .
policeman ?
arrest that man for assault .
- Come here , you !
- Leave me alone .
attacking a storm trooper !
you &apos;ll hear from my lawyer .
he bit my finger !
sorry , I didn &apos;t mean to hit you .
I enjoyed that .
but you &apos;d better beat it .
- I &apos;ll call a policeman .
- No !
- Why not ?
- Are you crazy ?
more are coming !
- More what ?
- Wait !
come in here .
what &apos;s wrong with you ?
don &apos;t be foolhardy .
what &apos;s this ?
who hit you ?
I think it was a gang .
you &apos;d better get fixed up .
we &apos;ll investigate later .
what time is it ?
all right , they &apos;ve gone .
thanks , mister .
that did me a lot of good .
you &apos;ve sure got some nerve .
we should all fight back .
we can &apos;t fight alone , but we can lick &apos; em together .
we didn &apos;t do so bad .
you &apos;re the barber , who was in hospital !
Mr. Jaeckel has talked about you .
we didn &apos;t think you &apos;d come back .
the storm troopers will be after you .
you &apos;d better hide . I &apos;ll get the key to the cellar .
- Is this the man ?
- That &apos;s him .
hail Hynkel !
who &apos;s he ?
don &apos;t fool with me .
hail Hynkel !
your hands .
just a moment .
not here .
bring him outside .
first you &apos;ll finish this .
here .
go on , paint that !
wait a minute , boys .
I &apos;ve got a bright idea .
Commander Schultz !
first in command .
second in command .
Oh , never mind . you !
who told you to hang people from lampposts ?
what was the trouble ?
a Jew attacking storm troopers .
- Where is he ?
- There .
break ranks .
so there you are .
stand him up .
get up .
you ?
don &apos;t you remember me ?
- You saved my life .
- Me ?
strange .
and I always thought of you as an Aryan .
I &apos;m a vegetarian .
don &apos;t you remember ?
we got away in my plane .
plane ?
then we crashed .
now I remember .
well , how are you ?
what &apos;s my friend done ?
he resisted my men painting his windows .
any brave man would resist .
I &apos;m sorry for this .
no harm .
in future you will not be molested again .
if you or your friends ever need help ...
who did that ?
one of my friends .
Hynkel &apos;s palace was the centre of the world &apos;s greatest war machine .
behind it was the dynamic Adenoid Hynkel , whose genius ran the nation , whose ceaseless activity kept him occupied every moment of the day .
Marshal Herring is waiting .
enough !
I believe we &apos;ve got something now .
a bulletproof uniform . the material is as light as silk .
where ?
I &apos;ve arranged for a demonstration . it will only take two minutes .
I can spare one .
Professor Herr Kibitzen .
actions speak louder than words .
a bulletproof uniform .
one hundred percent perfect .
shoot !
far from perfect .
- Where &apos;s my secretary ?
- In the outer office .
call her .
take a letter .
herring here in the tower room .
we &apos;ve got something marvellous .
I shall be up .
a parachute . the most compact in the world .
worn like a hat .
it will open in 25 feet .
demonstrate , professor .
herring , why do you waste my time like this ?
send Garbitsch here .
Herr Garbitsch is waiting .
enough !
what &apos;s the meaning of this ?
25 million for prison camps ?
we need to manufacture munitions .
- We &apos;ve made a few arrests .
- How many ?
five or ten thousand ... a day .
- A day ?
- Just a few dissenters .
Dissenting about ?
working hours , wage cuts , the synthetic food , the quality of the sawdust in the bread .
what more do they want ? it &apos;s from the finest lumber !
nevertheless , the people are overworked .
they need diversion .
the people , bah !
we might go further with the Jews .
burn some of their houses .
an assault on the ghetto .
something more dramatic .
when can we be ready to invade Osterlich ?
three months .
I can &apos;t wait .
Napaloni &apos;s army might invade first .
we must strike now .
we &apos;ll require foreign capital .
borrow it !
the bankers have refused .
one man might make us a loan :
Epstein .
- Epstein ?
he &apos;s a Jew , isn &apos;t he ?
- Yes .
well , let &apos;s be big about it .
we &apos;ll borrow from Epstein .
it might be difficult in view of our policy towards his people .
then we &apos;ll change our policy .
tell Schultz all persecution of the Jews must cease .
at least till we &apos;ve negotiated this loan .
I don &apos;t understand it . the whole ghetto is so quiet .
you can &apos;t imagine what was going on .
this Hynkel business .
you weren &apos;t here , you were in the hospital , unconscious .
you don &apos;t appreciate what a good time you were having .
if things get worse we can go to Osterlich .
that &apos;s still free .
sooner or later we &apos;ll have to go .
anyway , it &apos;s nice to see you back .
it &apos;s like the old days again , eh ?
how &apos;s business ?
very slow .
the men are in concentration camp .
you should fix up the women .
the beauty parlour business .
know anything about it ?
you can learn . you can practise on Hannah .
Hannah , get in that chair , we &apos;ll make you look beautiful .
what for ?
he &apos;s going to practise on you .
not with mud on my face ?
no , we &apos;ll take some off .
make me look beautiful ?
sure . he can &apos;t make you look any worse !
Mrs. Shoemaker &apos;s laundry !
I &apos;ll give it to her . you sit here and enjoy yourself .
I know . I &apos;ve seen you making eyes .
don &apos;t pay any attention to him .
I like your shop since it &apos;s fixed up .
I wish I had a business like this . there &apos;s no future in housework .
maybe if I save my money I can have a barbershop some day .
but I can never save . money slips through my fingers .
I &apos;ve always lived up to every penny I &apos;ve earned .
why shouldn &apos;t I ?
you &apos;re here today and gone tomorrow .
do you believe in God ?
I do .
but if there wasn &apos;t one , would you live any different ?
I wouldn &apos;t .
life could be wonderful if people &apos;d leave you alone .
things are looking brighter now .
maybe because of you saving Schultz .
funny how they &apos;ve left us alone .
too good to be true .
do you ever daydream ?
that &apos;s the only time I &apos;m really happy : dreaming .
sometimes I get so carried away I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m doing .
aren &apos;t you like that ?
we &apos;re very much alike .
- Both absent-minded .
- You think so ?
I like absent-minded people .
like the man who put his watch in boiling water and held the egg !
all great men are absent-minded .
it &apos;s a sign you &apos;re smart .
my folks didn &apos;t think so .
you have an excuse . you were injured in the war .
I was born that way .
I wonder why women never grow whiskers .
isn &apos;t that foolish of me ?
I could kick myself in the shins , I could ...
I &apos;ll give you a shampoo .
ain &apos;t I cute ?
how did you do it ?
you should try it on yourself .
fixed up , you &apos;d look handsome .
four pecks a pound , new potatoes !
the potato man !
I have to go .
take it easy there .
did you hurt yourself ?
- Careful next time .
- Here &apos;s another one .
how do you do ?
something &apos;s happened .
the storm troopers helped me up .
how wonderful if they stopped hating us , if they let us go about our business like we used to .
how wonderful if we didn &apos;t have to go to another country .
I don &apos;t want to go .
with all the persecution , I still love it here .
perhaps we don &apos;t have to go .
wouldn &apos;t it be wonderful if they &apos;d let us live and be happy again ?
full stop .
nothing works !
not even a sharp pencil .
I &apos;m surrounded by incompetent , stupid , sterile stenographers .
I &apos;ll get you a pen .
don &apos;t bother !
I won &apos;t send it .
get out , get out !
we &apos;ve just discovered the most wonderful poison gas .
it will kill everybody ...
all right .
later .
B76 to see Herr Herring .
a lady .
my secret agent .
your secret agent ?
tell her to come here .
have B76 come right in .
any news from Epstein ?
our agent reports that all the board of directors are Aryans .
- The loan &apos;s bound to go through .
a strike at the arms factory .
- The leader ?
- Five of them .
- Have them shot .
- They were .
how many were going to strike ?
three thousand of them .
have them all shot .
I don &apos;t want dissatisfied workers .
these men are skilled craftsmen .
let &apos;s train others first , then shoot them !
cannot afford to be lenient .
the rhythm of production will be affected .
rhythm ...
all right , have your rhythm .
spare the strikers and permit them to return to work .
but mark them for future reference .
that &apos;s my department . I &apos;ll attend to that . this way .
the strike leaders are all brunettes . not one blond .
troublemakers ! worse than Jews .
- Then wipe them out !
- &quot; Doucement &quot; .
we &apos;ll get rid of the Jews first , then concentrate on the brunettes .
we shall never have peace till we have a pure Aryan race .
how wonderful !
Tomainia , a nation of blue-eyed blonds .
why not a blond Europe , Asia , America ?
- And a brunette dictator .
- Of the world !
why not ?
aut Caesar aut nullus . the world &apos;s effete , worn out , afraid .
no nation would dare oppose you .
dictator of the World !
it &apos;s your destiny .
we &apos;ll kill off the Jews , wipe out the brunettes , then will come forth a pure Aryan race .
beautiful blond Aryans .
they will love you , they will worship you as a god .
no , you mustn &apos;t say it .
you make me afraid of myself .
dictator of the World !
we &apos;ll invade Osterlich first . after that we can bluff .
the nations will capitulate .
the world will be under your thumb .
leave me !
I want to be alone .
aut Caesar aut nullus .
emperor of the World !
my world .
the happy hour programme .
work with the rhythm of music .
our next selection :
Brahms &apos; Hungarian Dance number five .
fifteen cents , please .
happy hour signing off .
at six , Adenoid Hynkel will address the children of the double-cross .
it seems like the old days again .
how long is it going to last ?
in the papers it &apos;s rumoured that Hynkel &apos;s going to give the Jews back their rights .
maybe .
what do you want ?
business is much better .
nobody interferes with us any more .
doesn &apos;t that make you feel good ?
the trouble , Mr. Jaeckel , is you &apos;re so used to bad times , you &apos;re unhappy without them .
get my Sunday shoes .
they &apos;re on the windowsill .
I can &apos;t find the shawl .
I &apos;ve got a shawl .
what &apos;s going on ?
they &apos;re dressing Hannah up to go out .
is that so ?
she &apos;s got a beau .
- Who is it ?
- The barber .
now , turn around .
- My dear ! those hands !
- What &apos;s the matter with them ?
those calluses .
they &apos;re so rough .
maybe I better not go .
don &apos;t be foolish .
he knows you do housework .
wait !
I &apos;ll get a pair of mittens .
see if he &apos;s ready .
not yet .
he &apos;s polishing a bald man &apos;s head .
bad news .
the invasion of Osterlich will have to be delayed .
- What ?
- Epstein refuses to lend the money .
Epstein refuses , eh ?
send for Schultz .
Epstein refuses .
what did he say ?
he complained of the persecution and said he wouldn &apos;t have any dealings with a mediaeval maniac .
he &apos;ll deal with a mediaeval maniac more than he thinks !
first I shall deal with his people .
- Your Excellency ?
- Call out the storm troopers .
a little mediaeval entertainment in the ghetto !
at such a time I think it ill-advised .
such demonstrations demoralise the country .
indeed ?
since when do you care about the ghetto ?
I speak in the interests of our party and the cause of humanity .
you need a holiday .
fresh air .
a little outdoor exercise .
I &apos;ll send you to a concentration camp .
place Schultz under arrest .
very well , but remember my words .
your cause is doomed to failure because it is built on the stupid persecution of innocent people .
your policy is worse than a crime .
it &apos;s a tragic blunder .
traitor !
traitor !
you &apos;re a double-dyed democrat !
Schultz , why have you forsaken me ?
Excellency , here are the notes for your speech .
I &apos;ll not need them .
what I say will not be directed to the children of the double-cross but to the children of Israel !
that Hynkel isn &apos;t such a bad fellow after all .
most amusing .
get a Hynkel badge !
a Hynkel badge !
a fine photo on each !
- We &apos;d better go home .
- Yeah .
let &apos;s hurry .
wait a minute .
what &apos;s that ?
turn off the radio .
the storm troopers !
- Bar that door !
- Get some water !
get the women and children upstairs . lock all the doors .
you men , stay right here .
we &apos;ve got to make a stand .
we might as well die as live like this .
wait a minute . we have a social call to make here .
wait a minute !
Schultz gave strict orders not to molest anyone in this court .
these Jews attacked us .
I don &apos;t care .
orders were to keep out .
you saw that !
I can &apos;t help it .
Schultz &apos;s orders .
let &apos;s get going .
orders or not , I &apos;m going to get that girl .
out !
Schultz arrested !
hear that ?
he &apos;s arrested Commander Schultz .
- A Jew corrupted our commander .
- Let &apos;s kill the louse !
Schultz is accused of treason , and you know why .
Schultz was a friend of that barber .
let &apos;s get the barber !
we want the barber !
it &apos;s the storm troopers !
- Get on the roof .
- No .
- They &apos;ll kill you !
- I &apos;ll fight .
don &apos;t be a fool , you &apos;ll be murdered .
get on the roof .
all right , here we are .
smash in the door !
come on , we &apos;ll give the barber a haircut !
where are the bombs ?
there goes the barbershop !
never mind .
we can start again .
we can go to Osterlich . that &apos;s still free .
Mr. Jaeckel says it &apos;s beautiful .
wonderful green fields , and they grow apples and grapes .
his brother &apos;s got a vineyard .
Mr. Jaeckel said he &apos;d take me with him .
now we can all go together .
it &apos;ll be wonderful living in the country , much better than a smoky old city .
and if we work hard and don &apos;t eat much , we can save money and buy a chicken farm .
there &apos;s money to be made in chickens .
look at that star !
isn &apos;t it beautiful !
Hynkel with all his power can never touch that .
all right , the coast is clear .
Commander Schultz escaped .
he &apos;s hiding in my cellar .
he &apos;s holding a meeting at midnight and he wants you to be there .
Hannah , you come and help Mrs. Jaeckel with the supper .
all right , I &apos;ll be down .
I don &apos;t understand it . this crazy midnight supper ...
what does this Schultz want of us ?
- He wants us to blow up the palace .
we Jewish people shouldn &apos;t get mixed up in such a business .
I know it but Schultz has them all hypnotised .
- I knew he was up to some mischief .
- Sure he is .
I found him putting a coin in one of your puddings .
don &apos;t worry , I &apos;ve fixed everything . wait and see .
gentlemen , may I claim your indulgence for a moment ?
we are here tonight to rid the country of a tyrant .
in order to carry this out one of us must die .
in ancient times the Aryan tribe of the Langobardians made human sacrifice to the god Thor .
at a feast by lottery the victim was chosen .
tonight , at this feast , one of you will be chosen .
each man will receive a pudding .
concealed in one of these is a coin .
whoever gets it must give up his life but he will join the long line of history &apos;s noble martyrs and will rid his country of a tyrant .
I know that it is the wish of all of us to be chosen this night to die for Tomainia .
much as I should like to participate in this ordeal , I cannot ...
why ?
don &apos;t you understand ?
he &apos;s too well known .
it must be somebody like us .
I can &apos;t see it like that .
it is a question of my honour .
it is very embarrassing .
Commander Schultz , I apologise for my friend .
let me say , on behalf of myself and the others , that we consider it a great privilege to die for our country .
very well , then .
gentlemen , I shall now retire until fate has chosen the liberator .
until then ...
hail Hynk ...
what am I saying ?
gentlemen , we have pledged our honour .
proceed !
gentlemen , the coin is here !
what &apos;s the meaning of this ?
somebody made a fool of us .
- I did .
- What ?
I put a coin in every pudding .
blowing up palaces and wanting to kill people !
we &apos;re in enough trouble !
Hannah &apos;s right . we &apos;ve all been foolish .
our place is at home , looking after our own affairs .
the papers say Schultz may be in the ghetto .
here , read it for yourself .
Hannah , read that .
&quot; mystery surrounds the disappearance of ex-Commander Schultz .
&quot; at police HQ it was believed he may be hiding in the ghetto .
&quot; a certain Jewish barber , reported to be a friend of Schultz ,
&quot; is wanted for questioning . &quot;
me ?
only for questioning . not too serious .
Meyerberg was only wanted for questioning . we never saw him again .
- Who is it ?
- It &apos;s me , Mr. Mann .
did you hear what they &apos;re saying about Schultz hiding in the ghetto ?
I know , I know .
don &apos;t you think it &apos;s serious if they find him in the house ?
don &apos;t you realise there are spies everywhere !
spies ?
what &apos;s the matter ?
he &apos;s wanted for questioning .
where &apos;s the Commander ?
in the next room .
if Commander Schultz is found in this house , we &apos;ll all go to a concentration camp and have our heads cut off , too !
am I arguing ?
then get rid of him .
you can &apos;t throw him out .
of course not .
but I &apos;d like to know how long he &apos;s going to stay here .
your breakfast is on the table .
thank you . I have breakfast waiting at home .
search every house .
- What now ?
- They &apos;re looking for Schultz .
he &apos;s in one of these houses .
they &apos;re always looking for somebody .
it &apos;s me .
let me in .
the storm troopers are searching every house .
tell the Commander .
- Did you tell him ?
- What is it ?
- The storm troopers .
- What ?
- You &apos;d both better get on the roof .
we can &apos;t leave all these things .
all of you , pack my cases .
you pack that .
clear this shelf .
pack this and this .
this mustn &apos;t be found .
open the door .
they &apos;re here !
get up on the roof .
nothing left behind !
- My golf clubs !
- The hatbox !
- Take this .
- Come on , let &apos;s hurry !
- Where are you going ?
- With him .
you &apos;ll see him later .
- I &apos;ll meet you tonight .
- All right .
take this .
quick !
open in the name of Hynkel !
stop !
look where you are !
I can &apos;t see , wait a moment .
my bag !
it &apos;s right here .
here it is .
don &apos;t drop the other one .
my golf clubs , not my golf clubs !
come here .
they &apos;ll see you .
quick , this way !
Woah , steady !
- Now be careful .
- Yes , sir .
lucky you didn &apos;t break your neck .
you &apos;ll pardon me .
I &apos;m sorry .
you guard the back .
wait a minute !
I &apos;ll have to bother you again .
there he is .
how are you ?
so-so .
here &apos;s your friend .
your silence will be appreciated .
take him to the wagon .
where are you going ?
smoking room .
come on , this way !
Osterlich !
I am pleased to announce that we are at last ready to march on Osterlich .
this was made possible by the genius of Field Marshal Herring , upon whom I shall now pin a token of my regard .
turn around .
gentlemen .
to Field Marshal Herring !
to the invasion of Osterlich !
elephant !
wait .
Napaloni &apos;s army is on the Osterlich front .
60,000 men are on the border .
to take Osterlich !
I can &apos;t believe it .
you can &apos;t believe it !
you let him steal a march on us .
I had the ground covered .
declare war on Napaloni !
Mobilise every division of the army and air force .
attack Bacteria at once !
- But ...
- Do as I tell you !
- Madness .
- Shut up !
will you sign this ?
what is it ?
a declaration of war .
Yes .
a pen !
I &apos;ll sign it .
a pen !
I &apos;ll sign it !
Napaloni ...
- It &apos;s Napaloni .
- Wait a minute .
Napaloni ?
you talk to him .
what &apos;ll I say ?
be nice , affable , pleasant .
well , well , how are you ?
no , he hasn &apos;t been playing much .
his Excellency ?
just now he &apos;s a little hoarse .
no , I mean he can &apos;t talk .
may I take a message ?
he says no doubt you &apos;ve heard about Osterlich .
he wants to discuss it .
ask him to come here .
his Excellency invites you to Tomainia to discuss the matter .
very well .
I &apos;ll make the arrangements .
he &apos;s coming .
good .
we &apos;ll put on the greatest military show the world has ever known .
Napaloni will leave the invasion of Osterlich to me .
and this ?
- What is it ?
- Your declaration of war .
peace is declared !
2,975,000 eager citizens are massed in the station square awaiting Benzino Napaloni .
entering the station is our Phooey , ready to greet his guest .
this will cement the friendship between our Phooey and the Dictator of Bacteria .
his Excellency is about to greet the Bacterian ambassador .
how do you do ?
Garbitsch ...
see about the photography .
tell the press to see that our Phooey is well photographed .
- Not the back of his head !
- Yes , sir .
Napaloni &apos;s train is coming into the station .
from a pink and white carriage
Napaloni and his wife will step out and Adenoid Hynkel will deliver his address of welcome .
what &apos;s all this mix-up-a ?
they &apos;ve gone too far .
at ease !
bring the carpet .
why can &apos;t -a we get out here ?
No-a carpet .
who cares ?
me , Napaloni , I never get out without a carpet .
lay it down here .
quick .
- It &apos;s going back .
- What ?
let &apos;s get out while it &apos;s stopping .
shut up !
take it away !
stay here until they &apos;ve made up their minds .
you got-a da carpet .
put it down !
here he is .
- My friend !
- Napaloni !
this is indeed a pleasure .
welcome to Tomainia .
this way .
pictures !
sure .
salute !
another , please .
this is a pleasure , my friend Hynkel .
you want another ?
there .
where &apos;s -a my ambassador ?
Hello , Spook .
how do you feel ?
look after mamma .
Hynky , did you meet-a my wife ?
that &apos;s her .
let &apos;s go .
Tomainia ... very nice , very nice .
your clock is-a slow .
this way .
it &apos;s -a very nice people .
the people are very nice .
thank you .
he &apos;s my husband !
you make a mistake !
you make a big-a mistake !
Napaloni &apos;s army shall not invade Osterlich .
it belongs to me !
we shall not discuss the Osterlich situation .
this interview is to impress on him the force of your personality .
to make him feel your superiority .
Napaloni is aggressive , domineering .
we must put him in his place .
but how ?
by means of psychology .
by making him feel inferior .
this can be done subtly .
for instance ,
I have arranged that he &apos;ll be looking up at you , you looking down at him .
his position will be inferior .
then again we shall seat him here beside your bust so that if you relax that will always be glaring at him .
where is he now ?
resting .
I have arranged that he will enter from the far end of the room .
another psychological triumph .
he will have the embarrassment of walking the entire floor .
Signor Napaloni is now leaving his room .
he &apos;s coming .
quick , give me a flower .
at all times be above him , before him .
entering or leaving you must be first .
Hello , Hynky !
how are you feel ?
my brother dictate !
you &apos;re a nice-a little man .
I &apos;m so glad to see you again .
and my friend the Garbitsch !
this is a lovely place .
I feel-a fine .
I just had a nice cold shower .
when you have the plumbing fixed it &apos;ll be in good shape .
won &apos;t you sit down ?
well , Hynky , my dictator friend , you .
I must be a-growing !
what do they give me ?
a baby stool ?
this is not for me .
I like it better upstairs .
Garbitsch , this is a lovely country .
very nice-a people .
I thought the public enthusiastic .
sure .
they like to see new faces .
I &apos;m sorry for the mishap that occurred to Madam Napaloni .
what &apos;s that ?
I &apos;m sorry for the Napaloni that occurred at the ... at ...
madam Napaloni at the station .
she &apos;s not used to public life .
she can &apos;t take it .
match .
I &apos;m sorry ...
don &apos;t apologise . I find-a one .
I &apos;m simply crazy about this palace .
ivory and gold .
a lovely combination .
gets away from that gingerbread idea .
tell me something , Garbitsch , what &apos;s on the programme ?
the grand ball this evening .
and a review of the army .
that won &apos;t take-a long !
I &apos;m afraid it will .
so you got a big army , huh ?
modesty forbids .
seems I &apos;ve heard about it .
I think I &apos;ll get me a shave .
we have a barbershop .
is that so ?
you look blue under the gills .
what do you say we go together ?
- Delighted .
- Good !
very well , this way .
this is it .
I can-a smell &apos; em .
this is-a very sweet .
it was the library .
a good barbershop .
- Too old-fashioned .
- Is that so ?
when I get shaved I like something to look at .
so I &apos;m putting in glass walls .
this way , I shall have a view of the mountains .
and this , a view through the glass ceiling .
- What &apos;s above ?
- The ballroom .
in my summer palace I have a barbershop .
is that so ?
also with glass walls .
you don &apos;t tell me !
with goldfish inside .
goldfish swimming inside the walls ?
how do you feed them ?
you can &apos;t , they &apos;re all dead .
that &apos;s why I &apos;m building a new one .
- Very interesting !
- You like it ?
the Hynkel stadium .
before half a million spectators the greatest ever display of arms marches by in review .
our beloved Phooey and I &apos;ll-Dig-a-Ditchy are seated , thrilled by this historic event .
what ?
nothing .
I &apos;m just chewing .
some peanuts ?
- I &apos;ve had some .
- Good shape .
here you are , Spook .
now passing , Tomainia &apos;s heavy artillery .
it &apos;s all right .
I want to show you my new bombing planes .
they &apos;re coming over .
- Where from ?
- Aroma .
Aroma ?
that &apos;s 400 miles away .
right .
I don &apos;t know what &apos;s detaining them .
now passing , Tomainia &apos;s light artillery .
very light !
and here come the armoured tanks , the pride of Tomainia &apos;s army .
the latest design , the last word in modern warfare .
where &apos;s the propellers ?
for going under the water !
under water ?
you never heard of tanks that go under the water and fly up-a stairs ?
- What &apos;s that ?
- Under the water and in the air .
Obsolete now !
we &apos;re concentrating on flying dreadnoughts .
- What &apos;s that ?
- My planes !
now passing , Hynkel &apos;s flying division number 34 .
our planes !
you &apos;re right .
they &apos;re yours .
Garbitsch !
the invasion of Osterlich .
our troops , tanks and guns will be hidden along the border .
to disarm suspicion , you will go hunting .
then you will show up at Pretzelburg , meet the army , step into a car and cross over into Osterlich .
herring and I will be waiting at the capital .
first Napaloni must remove his troops .
to be decided tonight .
where is Napaloni ?
I &apos;ll look for him .
it might be advisable for you to dance with Madam Napaloni .
it &apos;ll carry weight .
you mean I will !
you find him ! and let me know at once .
- Madam Napaloni ...
- Your Excellency !
why so triste ?
because I no speak .
no ?
may I have the pleasure ?
allow me .
madam , your dancing was superb .
excellent .
very good .
good .
- My dear Adenoid .
- Benzino !
I &apos;ve been looking for you .
let &apos;s go to some quiet place where we can talk-a things over .
- As you wish .
- An excellent idea .
to the buffet !
of course , this way .
there &apos;s a Tomainian proverb ...
funny .
I wish I understand it .
now about the border .
Yes .
no problem .
it should be no trouble .
- What &apos;s the matter ?
- Wait .
you , too . out !
out .
- So ... the border question .
- Yes .
it &apos;s just a matter of detail .
formalities .
strawberries !
- Have you any English mustard ?
- English mustard .
- That &apos;s da hot-a stuff ?
- Very hot .
good shape .
cream .
Hynky , I &apos;m going to make this very simple .
you agree not to invade Osterlich ,
I agree not to invade Osterlich .
we sign , then I remove my troops from the border .
when your troops are gone , I sign .
that &apos;s -a right .
just a minute , you don &apos;t understand .
first we sign , then I remove-a da troops .
- Precisely .
I sign after .
- Just a minute .
Hey , Spook , treaty .
Hold-a dis .
now , look , you sign-a dis treaty first .
then I remove my troops after .
why are we arguing ?
you said I remove first .
I can &apos;t sign while they &apos;re there .
- I won &apos;t remove them till you sign .
- Why not ?
- Why should I ?
- Osterlich is a free country !
your soldiers are there .
and they &apos;ll stay until you sign .
I &apos;ll blow them off .
this won &apos;t get us anywhere .
to quote an old Latin phrase ...
strawberries !
where &apos;s -a my sandwich ?
another one !
I don &apos;t get this treatment in my own joint !
can &apos;t we discuss this without passion ?
I &apos;m not-a passionate .
I &apos;m just ...
I want him to sign the treaty .
what would my people think , signing such a treaty when your soldiers are on the border ?
I won &apos;t move until you sign !
not until you clear the border will I sign !
then they remain .
then I kick them off .
one move from you and my artillery will blow you to pieces !
and my aeroplanes will bomb your artillery like that !
you want-a start a world war ?
you and the world I &apos;ll throw in the ocean !
strawberries !
your Excellency , we have ...
I got-a my guns here in the pass and I &apos;ll blow him to pieces .
what &apos;s the matter ?
what ails you ?
this isn &apos;t like you .
Hey , Garbitsch , come here .
what &apos;s with Hynky ?
mustard on his strawberries .
what else can you expect from Hynky ?
my little bambino !
the Bacterian ...
Tomainia ...
you cannot treat Bacteria this way .
I &apos;ll take the Bacterian people and tear them apart , like this !
look what he &apos;s doing !
it &apos;s an insult to my people !
he &apos;s -a tearing spaghetti !
he sign-a the treaty or we have a war !
give me a-something !
quick , give me a-something !
- I have an appointment .
- What &apos;s this ?
press .
how &apos;s the conference progressing ?
very successfully .
how did you get in ?
how did he get here ?
you know the regulations about reporters .
no one is to enter the palace under any circumstances , understand ?
there are minor details to be cleaned up ...
excuse me , we &apos;re busy .
the whole world will know we &apos;re fighting !
- So what ?
- Can &apos;t we come to an agreement ?
when he signs .
I sign nothing .
I must speak to you alone .
do you mind ?
mind ?
I don &apos;t mind !
sign !
sign !
he &apos;ll have the advantage .
it &apos;s a mere scrap of paper .
when his troops are off the border , we can move in .
I &apos;ll sign .
what ?
Hold-a this .
Ah , my little Hynky !
my dictator brother !
I knew we have-a no trouble .
two prisoners escaped in officers &apos; uniforms .
sound the alarm !
two prisoners escaped .
the planes are searching for us .
the woods .
no , the open .
the border &apos;s that way .
the invasion of Osterlich .
now or never .
ducks .
did you hear that ?
it came from over there .
a yodeller .
where did you get that outfit ?
- What ?
- Don &apos;t answer back !
where &apos;s Schultz ?
you won &apos;t talk , eh ?
- He will when we get him to camp .
- Come on .
there it is .
the village of Pretzelburg .
if we can pass through there we &apos;re safe .
through the woods ?
they &apos;re swarming with soldiers .
they &apos;d suspect us at once .
if you see anyone , don &apos;t look right or left .
we must bluff our way through .
here they come .
can you see what they &apos;re doing ?
- Looking this way .
- Keep going !
they &apos;re following us .
shall we run ?
certainly not .
just a little bit ?
keep walking !
we could walk faster .
make up your mind .
slow down ?
- No !
- There &apos;s no hurry .
he &apos;s here !
sound assembly !
attention !
present arms !
turn back ?
no , keep going !
hail Hynkel !
your Excellency , everything is under control .
- Good .
- Good .
I have been in communication with Marshal Herring in Osterlich .
the route is well guarded .
behind us are 200 tanks , 50 armoured cars and 500 machine-guns .
- Good .
- Good .
are we ready to start ?
- Yes .
- Yes .
gentlemen .
Schultz , I &apos;m happy you &apos;re with us again .
thank you .
where are we going ?
you &apos;re invading Osterlich .
they &apos;re coming .
your Excellency .
the world awaits your words .
what &apos;s happened ?
he looks strange .
what &apos;s Schultz doing here ?
Pardoned , I suppose .
his Excellency Herr Garbitsch ,
secretary of the Interior , Minister of Propaganda ...
Corona veniet delectis .
victory shall come to the worthy .
today , democracy , liberty and equality are words to fool the people .
no nation can progress with such ideas .
they stand in the way of action .
therefore , we abolish them .
in the future , each man will serve the state with absolute obedience .
let him who refuses beware !
citizenship will be taken away from all Jews and non-Aryans .
they are inferior and therefore enemies of the state .
it is the duty of all true Aryans to hate and despise them .
this nation is annexed to the Tomainian Empire , and the people will obey the laws bestowed on us by our great leader ,
the Dictator of Tomainia , the conqueror of Osterlich , the future Emperor of the World !
you must speak .
I can &apos;t .
you must .
it &apos;s our only hope .
hope ...
I &apos;m sorry but I don &apos;t want to be an emperor .
that &apos;s not my business .
I don &apos;t want to rule or conquer anyone .
I should like to help everyone :
Jew , gentile , black man , white .
we all want to help one another .
human beings are like that .
we want to live by each other &apos;s happiness , not misery .
we don &apos;t want to hate one another .
in this world , the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone .
the way of life can be free and beautiful but we have lost the way .
greed has poisoned men &apos;s souls , has barricaded the world with hate , has goose-stepped us into bloodshed .
we have developed speed but have shut ourselves in .
machinery has left us in want .
our knowledge has made us cynical , our cleverness , hard and unkind .
we think too much and feel too little .
more than machinery we need humanity .
more than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness .
without these qualities , life will be violent and all will be lost ...
the aeroplane and radio have brought us closer .
these inventions cry out for the goodness in man , cry out for universal brotherhood , for the unity of us all .
even now my voice is reaching millions , millions of despairing men , women and children , victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people .
to those who can hear me I say , do not despair .
the misery upon us is but the passing of greed , the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress .
the hate of men will pass , and dictators die , and the power they took will return to the people .
so long as men die liberty will never perish .
soldiers , don &apos;t give yourselves to brutes , men who despise you , enslave you , regiment your lives , tell you what to think and feel , who drill you , treat you like cattle and use you as cannon fodder .
don &apos;t give yourselves to these men , machine men with machine minds and machine hearts .
you are not machines , you are not cattle , you are men !
you have the love of humanity in you .
don &apos;t hate .
only the unloved and the unnatural hate .
soldiers , don &apos;t fight for slavery , fight for liberty !
St. Luke says , &quot; The Kingdom of God is within man . &quot;
not in one man nor a group of men , but in all men .
in you !
you have the power to create machines , the power to create happiness .
you have the power to make this life free and beautiful , to make this life a wonderful adventure .
in the name of democracy , let us use that power .
let us all unite , let us fight for a new world , a world that will give men a chance to work , that will give youth a future and old age security .
promising these things , brutes have risen .
but they lie !
they do not fulfil that promise .
they never will !
dictators free themselves but they enslave the people .
now let us fight to fulfil that promise !
let us fight to free the world , to do away with national barriers , to do away with greed , with hate and intolerance .
let us fight for a world of reason , a world where science and progress will lead to the happiness of all .
soldiers , in the name of democracy , let us unite !
Hannah , can you hear me ?
wherever you are , look up , Hannah .
the clouds are lifting , the sun is breaking through .
we are coming out of the darkness into a new world , a kindlier world , where men will rise above their hate , their greed and their brutality .
look up , Hannah .
the soul of man has been given wings .
he is flying into the rainbow , into the light of hope , into the future , the glorious future that belongs to you , to me and to all of us .
look up , Hannah .
look up !
did you hear that ?
listen ...
copy boy !
- Make it snappy .
- Where &apos;s the rest of this story ?
morning Post .
city desk ?
just a moment and I &apos;ll connect you .
if anybody asks for me , I &apos;m down at the courthouse .
- Elevator !
- Going down .
- Hello , Hildy .
- Hi , Skinny .
Hello , Ruth , Maisie .
- Is the lord of the universe in ?
- Yes , in a bad humor .
somebody must &apos;ve stolen the crown jewel .
- Shall we announce you ?
- I &apos;ll blow my own horn .
Bruce , wait here . I &apos;ll be back in ten minutes .
even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you .
what did you say ?
go on .
well , go ahead .
I just said , &quot; Even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you &quot; .
I heard you . I like it . that &apos;s why I asked you to say it again .
I like being spoiled . the man I &apos;m going in to see did little spoiling .
I &apos;d like to spoil him . want me to go with you ?
- I can handle it .
- Lf it gets rough , I &apos;m here .
I &apos;ll come running , partner .
- Hello , Jim .
- Hello , Hildy !
- How are you ?
- Welcome back .
Hello , Hildy , how have you been ?
Beatrice , how &apos;s &quot; Advice to the Lovelorn &quot; ?
- Fine . my cat had kittens again .
- Your own fault .
glad to see you . Hi , Jim .
Mildred , you still around ?
a little more around the chin , boss .
what do you want ?
your ex-wife is here .
Hello , Hildy .
Hello , Walter .
Hello , Louie . how &apos;s the big slot machine king ?
I ain &apos;t doing that no more . I &apos;m retired . you know what I mean ?
- Walter .
- I &apos;m busy !
the governor didn &apos;t sign that reprieve .
tomorrow , Earl Williams dies and makes a sucker out of us .
what are you going to do ?
- Phone the governor .
- I can &apos;t .
- Why not ?
- He &apos;s out fishing .
- How many places are there ?
- At least two , Atlantic and Pacific .
that simplifies it , doesn &apos;t it ?
- Get him on the phone .
- And say what ?
quiet , Duffy . he &apos;s thinking .
tell him if he reprieves Earl Williams , we &apos;ll support him for senator .
tell him the Morning Post will be behind him .
- You can &apos;t do that .
- Why not ?
we &apos;ve been a Democratic paper for over 20 years .
after we get the reprieve , we &apos;ll be Democratic again .
go on , Duffy , get going . the Morning Post expects every editor to do his duty .
you too , Louie . get out of here .
well , Walter , I see you &apos;re still at it .
first time I double-crossed a governor . what can I do for you ?
would you mind if I sat down ?
there &apos;s a lamp burning in the window for you . here .
I jumped out of that window a long time ago , Walter .
may I have one of those ?
thank you .
and a match ?
thank you .
- How long is it ? - How long is what ?
you know what .
how long is it since we &apos;ve seen each other ?
well , let &apos;s see .
I spent six weeks in Reno , then Bermuda . about four months .
seems like yesterday to me .
maybe it was yesterday , Hildy . been seeing me in your dreams ?
mama doesn &apos;t dream about you . you wouldn &apos;t know her now .
Yes , I would . I &apos;d know you anytime .
any place , anywhere .
you &apos;re repeating yourself . you said that the night you proposed .
you still remember it .
if I didn &apos;t remember it , I wouldn &apos;t have divorced you .
I sort of wish you hadn &apos;t .
- What ?
- Divorced me .
it makes a fellow lose faith in himself .
it gives him a feeling he wasn &apos;t wanted .
Junior , that &apos;s what divorces are for .
nonsense , you &apos;ve got an old-fashioned idea divorces last forever .
&quot; till death do us part &quot; . divorce doesn &apos;t mean anything nowadays .
just a few words mumbled over you by a judge .
- I suppose you &apos;re right in a way .
- Sure , I &apos;m right .
- I am fond of you , you know .
- Thattagirl !
I often wish you weren &apos;t such a stinker .
you must meet my mother . she &apos;d like that phrase .
I meant to let you go , but you know you never miss the water till the well runs dry .
a big lummox like you , hiring an airplane to write :
&quot; Hildy , don &apos;t be hasty . remember my dimple . Walter &quot; .
it delayed our divorce while the judge watched it .
not to brag , but I &apos;ve still got the dimple , and in the same place .
I acted like any husband who didn &apos;t want to see his home broken up .
- What home ?
- Remember the home I promised you ?
sure I do . the one we were to have right after the honeymoon .
that honeymoon !
was it my fault ?
did I know that coal mine would have a cave-in ?
I intended to be with you on our honeymoon .
instead of two weeks in Atlantic City with my bridegroom I spent two weeks in a coal mine with John Kruptzky .
you don &apos;t deny it ?
no . we beat the whole country on that story !
suppose we did !
that isn &apos;t what I got married for !
what is the good ?
look , Walter .
I came to tell you to stop phoning me a dozen times a day sending me 20 telegrams ...
I write a beautiful telegram , don &apos;t I ?
are you going to listen ?
what &apos;s the use of fighting ?
I &apos;ll tell you what you do .
come back to work on the paper , and if we can &apos;t get along we &apos;ll get married again .
- What ?
- Sure , I haven &apos;t any hard feelings .
Walter , you &apos;re wonderful in a loathsome sort of way .
- Be quiet so I can say what I have to .
- Tell me over lunch .
I have a lunch date .
- Break it .
- I can &apos;t .
hands off !
are you playing osteopath ?
temper , temper .
you are no longer my husband and no longer my boss .
and you won &apos;t be my boss .
- What does that mean ?
- Just what I say .
you &apos;re not coming back to work ?
you &apos;re right for the first time today .
- Got a better offer ?
- You bet !
work for somebody else !
that &apos;s the gratitude I get .
stop hamming .
five years ago , you were a college girl . I took a doll-faced hick !
you wouldn &apos;t have if I wasn &apos;t doll-faced .
it was a novelty to have a face to look at without shuddering .
I made you a great reporter . you won &apos;t be as good on any other paper .
we &apos;re a team . the paper needs both of us !
sold American !
- All right , go ahead .
- Listen , Walter , please .
the paper &apos;s going to have to get along without me . so will you .
it didn &apos;t work out .
it would have worked if you &apos;d been satisfied as editor and reporter .
you had to marry me and spoil everything .
I wasn &apos;t satisfied ?
I suppose I proposed to you !
practically !
making eyes at me until I broke down .
&quot; Oh , Walter ! &quot; I was tight when I proposed to you .
if you &apos;d been a gentleman , you &apos;d have forgotten about it .
you used to pitch better than that . Hello . what ?
Sweeney ?
what can I do for you ?
what ?
wait a minute . I &apos;m not Sweeney . I &apos;m Duffy .
Sweeney , you can &apos;t do that to me . not today , of all days !
what &apos;s the matter with you ?
are you a loony ?
now , listen , Sweeney . this is no time ...
all right , I suppose so . if you have to , you have to .
- He had to .
- Everything happens to me .
365 days in a year , and this has to be the day .
what &apos;s wrong ?
- Sweeney .
- Dead ?
he might as well be . he picks today to have a baby !
not on purpose ?
he &apos;s supposed to cover the Earl Williams case , and where is he ?
walking up and down in a hospital . is there no honor ?
haven &apos;t you got anybody else ?
nobody else on the paper can write . this &apos;ll break me . unless ...
Hildy !
- You &apos;ve got to help me .
- Not a chance , Walter .
get out of here , Duffy ! save your breath .
this &apos;ll bring us back together again .
that &apos;s what I &apos;m afraid of .
this is bigger than anything else . do it for the paper .
scram , Svengali .
if you won &apos;t do it for love , how about money ?
I &apos;ll raise you $ 25 a week .
listen to me , you baboon ...
I &apos;ll make it $ 35 and not a cent more .
listen !
how much will the other paper pay ?
there &apos;s no other paper .
then the raise is off . you go back to your old salary .
- I &apos;m busy .
- Take a good look at it .
do you know what it is ? it &apos;s an engagement ring .
engagement ring ?
I tried to tell you right away but you would start reminiscing .
I &apos;m getting married , and I &apos;m getting as far away from the newspaper business as I can get .
I &apos;m through .
- You can get married , but not quit .
- No ? why not ?
I know what quitting would mean .
- What ?
- It would kill you .
- You can &apos;t sell me that .
- You &apos;re a newspaperman .
I want to go someplace where I can be a woman .
- You mean , be a traitor .
- A traitor to what ?
to journalism . you &apos;re a journalist !
a journalist ?
what does that mean ?
peeking through keyholes , chasing fire engines waking people up in the night to ask questions stealing pictures off old ladies ?
I know all about reporters .
Buttinskies running around with no money , and for what ?
so a million people will know what &apos;s going on . why , I ...
what &apos;s the use ?
Walter , you wouldn &apos;t know what it means to want to be respectable and live a halfway normal life .
the point is , I &apos;m through .
where did you meet this man ?
Bermuda .
rich ?
he &apos;s not what you &apos;d call rich . he makes about $ 5000 a year .
- What &apos;s his line ?
- He &apos;s in the insurance business .
insurance business ?
that &apos;s a good honest business .
sure , it &apos;s honest . it &apos;s also adventurous , romantic .
I can &apos;t picture you being surrounded by policies ...
I can , and I like it , what &apos;s more .
besides , he forgets the office when he &apos;s with me .
he doesn &apos;t treat me like an errand boy . he treats me like a woman .
he does ?
how did I treat you ?
like a water buffalo ?
I don &apos;t know from buffaloes , but I do know about him .
he &apos;s kind , he &apos;s sweet , and he &apos;s considerate .
he wants a home and children .
sounds like a guy I ought to marry . what &apos;s his name ?
I knew a Baldwin once , a horse thief . couldn &apos;t be the same fellow , could it ?
you are not talking about the man I &apos;m marrying tomorrow .
tomorrow ?
as soon as that ?
at last , I got out what I came up here to tell you .
guess there isn &apos;t any more to the story .
so long , Walter .
so long , Hildy .
better luck to you next time .
well , you kind of took the wind out of my sail .
I just want to wish you everything I couldn &apos;t give you .
this other fellow . I &apos;m sorry I didn &apos;t get a chance to see him .
I &apos;m particular about whom my wife marries .
where is he ?
he &apos;s right on the job , waiting for me out there .
do you mind if I meet him ?
- It wouldn &apos;t do any good .
- You &apos;re not afraid , are you ?
of course not .
let &apos;s see this paragon . is he as good as you say ?
he &apos;s better .
- Then what does he want with you ?
- You got me .
back in an hour , Mildred .
I am sorry , Hildy . I suppose Bruce ...
what &apos;s his name ?
I suppose he opens doors for you ?
and with a lady , he takes his hat off .
I am sorry .
when he walks with a lady , he waits for her .
in that case ...
allow me .
I can see my wife picked out the right husband for herself .
there must be some mistake . I &apos;m already married .
already married ?
you should have told me . congratulations again , Mr. Baldwin .
- No , my name ...
- Mr. Burns .
I &apos;m terribly busy . what did you say , Mr. Baldwin ?
- Mr. Burns .
- My name is ...
I &apos;m busy with Mr. Baldwin . I didn &apos;t hear what you said , sir .
- My name is ...
- Mr. Burns ...
- What is it with you ?
- I &apos;m Bruce Baldwin .
can &apos;t you see that I &apos;m ...
you &apos;re Bruce Baldwin !
well , who is he ?
who are you ?
my name &apos;s Pete Davis .
Mr. Davis , is this any concern of yours ?
from now on , keep your nose out of my affairs .
don &apos;t let it happen again .
I &apos;m terribly sorry about this mistake . this is indeed a pleasure .
that &apos;s wrong , isn &apos;t it ?
Bruce ... do you mind if I call you Bruce ?
- We &apos;re almost related .
- No , not at all .
you see , my wife ... That is , your wife .
Hildy , you led me to expect you were marrying a much older man .
what did I say ?
don &apos;t worry about it . I realize you didn &apos;t mean old in years .
- Do you always carry an umbrella ?
- It looked cloudy this morning .
that &apos;s right . Rubbers too , I hope .
Thattaboy !
a man ought to be prepared .
we &apos;d better run along .
- We &apos;d better go .
- Where are we going ?
I &apos;m taking you two to lunch . didn &apos;t you tell him ?
no , she didn &apos;t .
I guess she just wanted to surprise you , Bruce .
after you , Hildy .
you &apos;re wasting your time .
no , I &apos;m glad to do it .
Hello , Gus .
it &apos;s Hildy !
it &apos;s none other . how are things ?
I can &apos;t complain .
I can . I &apos;m hungry . a roast beef sandwich ...
- Sorry .
- ... on white bread .
over there , Bruce .
- And you , Hildy ?
- I &apos;ll have the same .
- And you , sir ?
- Yes , that &apos;s all right for me .
bring some mustard too , Gus .
so you two are going to get married ?
- How does it feel , Bruce ?
- It feels awful good .
you &apos;re getting a great girl .
I realize that .
things have been different since I met Hildy .
I &apos;ve never met anyone quite like her .
everybody else I &apos;ve ever known you could always tell ahead of time what they would say or do .
but Hildy &apos;s not like that . you can &apos;t tell that about her .
that &apos;s nice .
you &apos;re getting something else too :
a great newspaperman .
no orchids , Walter .
one of the best I ever knew . sorry to see her go . darn sorry .
I &apos;d like to believe you .
I mean it .
if you ever want to come back ... Which I won &apos;t .
in spite of everything , there &apos;s only one man I &apos;d work for .
I &apos;d kill you if you worked for anybody else .
hear that ?
that &apos;s my diploma .
it must be quite a business if it &apos;s ...
are you sure you want to quit ?
what do you mean ?
if there is any doubt about it or if there &apos;s anything ...
no , this is your chance to have a home and to be , like you said , a human being .
I &apos;ll make you take that chance .
certainly . why , I wouldn &apos;t let her stay .
she deserves all this happiness . all the things I couldn &apos;t give her .
all she ever wanted was a home .
I &apos;ll certainly try .
I know you will , Bruce .
- Where will you live ?
- Albany .
- Got a family up there ?
- Just my mother .
just your mother . you &apos;re going to live with her ?
just for the first year .
that will be nice .
Yes , a home with mother , in Albany too .
mighty nice little town . it &apos;s the state capital .
I know . we were there once .
will you ever forget the night you brought the governor to the hotel ?
you see , I was in taking a bath . well , I came walking out without ...
she didn &apos;t know I was in town .
Bruce , how is business up there ?
any better ?
Albany &apos;s a mighty good insurance town .
most people take it out pretty early in life .
I can see why they would .
statistics show that most of ...
I &apos;ve got a feeling I ought to have taken out a little insurance .
that really doesn &apos;t matter now that Hildy and I have well , you know , we &apos;ve ...
does it ?
what do you think ?
it might have been a good idea if I had taken out insurance .
I honestly feel that way .
I &apos;m in one business that really helps people .
of course , we don &apos;t help you much while you &apos;re alive , but afterward . - That &apos;s what counts .
- Sure .
I don &apos;t get it .
nice going .
so sorry , Gus . my foot must have slipped .
that &apos;s all right . what would you like to drink ?
coffee .
- Shall I put some rum in the coffee ?
- Sure .
me too , Gus , please .
- Not for me .
- Go on , Bruce .
I have a lot to do . I have to buy the tickets , check the baggage ...
do it tomorrow .
we &apos;re leaving today at four o &apos;clock , taking the sleeper for Albany .
you &apos;re leaving today at four o &apos;clock ?
- That &apos;s only two hours .
- That &apos;s not much time .
I &apos;ve got a lot to do . I want to ...
isn &apos;t that silly ?
all down over my front .
- That &apos;s nothing new . here .
- Never mind , I &apos;ll get Gus .
Gus , do something about this , will you ?
call me to the telephone when I get back to the table .
thanks , Gus , that &apos;s fine .
I &apos;m terribly sorry about that . that was silly , wasn &apos;t it ?
let me get that straight . I must have misunderstood you .
you &apos;re taking the sleeper today , then getting married tomorrow ?
well , it &apos;s not like that .
what is it like ?
poor Walter . he &apos;ll toss and turn all night .
perhaps we &apos;d better tell him . mother &apos;s coming too .
your mother kicked the bucket ...
no , my mother .
your mother ?
well , that relieves my mind .
it was cruel to let you suffer so .
isn &apos;t Walter sweet ?
always wanting to protect me .
I admit I wasn &apos;t much of a husband , but you can always count on me .
I don &apos;t think she &apos;ll need you much . I aim to do the protecting myself .
Mr. Burns , telephone .
for me ?
that &apos;s strange .
pardon me .
he &apos;s not such a bad fellow .
no , he should make some girl real happy .
slaphappy .
he &apos;s not the man for you . I can see that .
but I sort of like him . he &apos;s got charm .
he comes by it naturally . his grandfather was a snake .
Hello ?
Duffy , listen .
any way we can stop the 4 : 00 train to Albany from leaving ?
- We might dynamite it .
- Could we ?
maybe we couldn &apos;t . all right , get this .
send Sweeney out of town on two weeks &apos; vacation right away .
keep your shirt on . Hildy &apos;s coming back .
she doesn &apos;t know it yet , but she &apos;s staying .
tell Louie to stick around the office . I may need him . Goodbye .
thanks , Gus .
- This is bad business .
- What &apos;s the matter ?
the Earl Williams case .
I &apos;ve been reading about that .
it &apos;s pretty bad .
- What is the lowdown on it ?
- Simple , honey .
poor little dope lost his job , went berserk and shot a cop who was coming to quiet him down .
what a shame .
your paper has been taking his side .
if he was out of his mind , why doesn &apos;t the state just put him away ?
because it was a colored policeman . you know what that means .
the colored vote &apos;s important .
especially with an election in three or four days .
that mayor would hang his grandmother to be reelected .
you could show the man wasn &apos;t responsible .
that &apos;s not so easy .
maybe it isn &apos;t so hard either .
what do you mean , Hildy ?
doesn &apos;t an expert have to examine him before they hang him ?
a bird named Egelhoffer is doing it . he &apos;ll say the same as the rest .
suppose he does .
what &apos;s your scheme ?
Walter , you get the interview with Earl Williams .
print Egelhoffer &apos;s statement . and right alongside it , double column , run your interview .
alienist says he &apos;s sane . interview shows he &apos;s goofy .
you could save that poor devil &apos;s life . you could ...
- You &apos;re going away . I forgot .
- How long would the interview take ?
an hour for the interview . an hour to write it .
we could take the 6 o &apos;clock train if it &apos;d save a man &apos;s life .
no , Bruce . if you want to save Earl Williams &apos; life write it yourself . you &apos;re a good reporter .
I can &apos;t write that kind of thing . it takes a woman &apos;s touch .
don &apos;t get poetic . get Sweeney .
he &apos;s the best man for that sob-sister stuff .
poor Sweeney . Duffy just told me his wife finally had twins . isn &apos;t that terrible ?
Sweeney went out to celebrate and now we can &apos;t find him . so Sweeney has twins and Williams gets hanged .
now , Walter , look .
argue with her , or you &apos;ll be on a honeymoon with blood on your hands .
how can you be happy after that ?
you &apos;ll remember that a man went to the gallows because she was too selfish to wait two hours .
Earl Williams &apos; face will come between you tonight and the rest of your life .
stop it , Walter . the whole place will hear you .
what an act .
I just remembered Sweeney was only married four months ago .
Hildy , you win . I &apos;m licked .
then Mrs. Sweeney didn &apos;t have twins ?
no , indeed . the twins were Walter &apos;s , all his .
it was nothing .
well , come on , let &apos;s forget it . we &apos;ll start over again .
- I &apos;ll offer a business proposition .
- Not interested .
you &apos;ll be interested .
don &apos;t listen to him . I know him from way back .
excuse me , will you ?
I &apos;m talking to him .
no , Mr. Burns . I wouldn &apos;t use my wife for business purposes .
wait a minute , Bruce .
- How big a policy ? - 25,000 .
fifty thousand .
what &apos;s the commission on a $ 100,000 policy ?
- Around $ 1000 , but Hildy ...
- And what &apos;s wrong with $ 1000 ?
- I couldn &apos;t ... - We could use that money .
how long would it take to get him examined ?
I could get a company doctor here in 20 minutes .
- Get him . get him .
- You keep out of this .
suppose you have Mr. Burns examined over in his office and see what they &apos;ll allow on that old carcass of his .
- I &apos;m better than I ever was .
- That &apos;s nothing to brag about .
I &apos;ll go back and change and after you get the check , phone me .
I &apos;ll be in the press room at the criminal courts building .
Oh , Walter ?
I think you better make that a certified check .
think I &apos;m a crook ?
Yes . no certified check , no story . get me ?
it &apos;ll be certified . want my fingerprints ?
no , thanks . I &apos;ve still got those .
Gus , how much do I owe you ?
thank you , dear .
- Oh , I &apos;m sorry .
- How much money have you got ?
you know , everything we have , $ 500 .
- Give me it .
- I have to buy the tickets .
I &apos;ll buy the tickets . believe me , he &apos;ll get you in a crap game .
Hildy , I don &apos;t gamble .
I know people that never did anything till they met Walter Burns .
but remember , it &apos;s everything we have .
I know .
- You got change of ten ?
- See what I mean , don &apos;t you , Bruce ?
I just gave everything to Hildy . all I &apos;ve got left ...
- Come on , Hildy .
- Not me . sign it .
all right .
for the waiter .
come on , Bruce . really .
I &apos;ll open for a dime .
I &apos;m in .
I &apos;ll stay .
Wilcox 3400 .
- How many ?
- Two .
take that , one of you birds . you ain &apos;t doing anything , Ernie .
what &apos;s the matter with you guys ?
crippled or something ?
I &apos;ll just bet 20 cents .
press room . wait a minute .
Hello , Sarge , McCue talking . hold the line , will you ?
what ?
I told you this is the press room of the criminal courts building .
Jake , new lead on the hanging . this alienist from New York , Dr. Max J. Egelhoffer .
he &apos;s interviewing Williams in about half an hour in the sheriff &apos;s office .
must be the tenth alienist they &apos;ve put on Williams .
if he wasn &apos;t crazy , he would be by the time ten of those babies got through psychoanalyzing him .
- Is this guy Egelhoffer any good ?
- You figure it out .
he &apos;s the guy they sent to Washington to interview the Brain Trust .
he said they were sane .
here &apos;s the situation on the eve of the hanging .
I &apos;ll pick up a little fudge . this is Murphy .
more slop on the hanging .
a double guard has been thrown around the jail , municipal buildings railroad terminals , and elevated stations to prepare for the expected general uprising of radicals at the hour of execution .
the sheriff has put 200 more relatives on the payroll to protect the city from the Red Army which is leaving Moscow in a couple of minutes .
trouble is , when the real Red Menace shows up the sheriff will still be crying wolf .
what do you got ?
- Is that good ?
- Sure looks good from here .
Hildy , when did you get back ?
- How are you , Eddie ?
- Glad to see you .
- Glad to see you . - Where &apos;d you get the hat ?
- I paid 12 bucks for that hat .
- Coming back to work ?
it &apos;s a farewell appearance . I &apos;m going into business for myself . - What doing ?
- I &apos;m getting married tomorrow .
again ?
are we invited to the wedding ?
I might use you for a bridesmaid , Roy .
- How are you , Murphy ?
- What are you getting married for ?
- None of your business .
- Ain &apos;t fooling us , are you ?
fooling ?
look what I &apos;ve got in here .
three tickets to Albany on the 6 : 00 train tonight .
three ?
for me and my beau and , hats off boys , his sweet darling ma .
- That &apos;s nice . - What kind of marriage is that ?
I &apos;m settling down . I &apos;m through with the newspaper business .
can you picture Hildy singing lullabies and hanging out didies ?
- Swapping lies over the back fence ?
- Sour grapes .
she &apos;ll get tired beating rugs .
I &apos;m not going to beat any rugs .
that &apos;s 3rd and Jefferson . where the Central School is .
- No school this time of day .
- What do you care for ? you quit .
you said you were through .
I just thought it might be a good fire , that &apos;s all .
- What &apos;s that ?
- Practicing for the Williams party .
- You &apos;ll miss a nice hanging . - Not interested .
tell them to pipe down .
keep quiet down there !
how do you expect us to get any work done ?
shut up !
very little respect for the press around here .
say , did anybody phone me ?
not that I know of .
say , Hildy , does Walter know you &apos;re getting married ?
- Just had lunch with him .
- Does he know you &apos;re quitting ?
- I told him . any more questions ?
- Shall I deal you in ?
I haven &apos;t got time . I have to do a yarn on Williams .
did he know what he was doing when he fired that gun ?
if you ask us , no . if you ask the state alienist , the answer is yes .
- Who is he ?
what &apos;s he do ?
- He was a bookkeeper .
he starts at $ 20 a week .
after 14 years he works himself up to $ 17.50 .
- Got more gum ?
McClosky Company goes out of business . Williams loses his job .
can &apos;t get another .
I &apos;m in .
so he hangs around the park listening to soapbox spellbinders making speeches , and begins believing them .
and makes some of his own .
- Up a dime .
- I &apos;m in .
- Anything else , Doc ?
- No , that &apos;ll be all , Mr. Burns .
everything okay ?
nothing to worry about .
good , good .
how are you doing , Bruce ?
just one more thing .
- Good day , Mr. Burns . Mr. Baldwin .
- Goodbye , Doc . thanks very much .
who &apos;s the beneficiary ?
- Excuse me ?
- That is , in case of your death .
- Who do we pay the money to ?
- Why , Hildy , of course .
I don &apos;t know . that would make me feel pretty funny .
now , why shouldn &apos;t I make Hildy my whatever-it-was ?
I feel I should take care of her .
but you will take care of her , Bruce .
say , if that doctor is right , I &apos;m good for a long time yet .
look , Bruce , this is a debt of honor with me .
I was a bad husband to Hildy .
she could have claimed a lot of alimony . but she wouldn &apos;t take any .
she had it coming to her , but she was too independent .
- I &apos;m independent too , you know .
- I know you are .
but look , you just figure it this way .
I &apos;m good for , we &apos;ll say at least 25 years yet .
by then , you &apos;ll have made enough so that money won &apos;t mean anything to you .
but suppose you haven &apos;t made good .
what about Hildy &apos;s old age ?
think of Hildy .
I can see her now .
white-haired , lavender and old lace .
- Can &apos;t you see her , Bruce ?
- Yes , yes , I can .
she &apos;s old , isn &apos;t she ?
don &apos;t you think that Hildy &apos;s entitled to spend her remaining years without worries of money ?
of course you do , Bruce .
of course , if you put it that way .
and remember , I love her too .
Yes , I &apos;m beginning to realize that .
and the beauty of it is she &apos;ll never have to know until I &apos;ve passed on .
maybe she &apos;ll think kindly of me after I &apos;m gone .
you make me feel like a heel , coming between you .
no , no , Bruce . you didn &apos;t come between us .
it was all over for her before you came on the scene .
what do you want ?
can I see you a minute , please ?
excuse me , Bruce .
did you get it , you get it ?
where is it ?
come on .
- Certified ?
- Sure . but Walter , that &apos;s for $ 2,500 .
here we are certified and everything .
certified .
I &apos;m afraid Hildy &apos;ll feel ashamed to think she hasn &apos;t trusted you .
but she &apos;ll know some day .
you promised to phone her as soon as you got the check .
Oh , yes , yes , of course .
get me Hildy Johnson , press room , criminal courts building .
sit down , Bruce . the operator will get her for you .
excuse me , will you ?
Yes , I &apos;ll wait , thank you .
start hollering . Hildegarde .
thank you .
Hildy Johnson speaking .
take it easy , will you ?
did you get the check ?
is it certified ?
certified and everything . I have it right in my pocket .
in your pocket . that &apos;s fine .
wait . maybe it isn &apos;t so fine . where are you ?
Mr. Burns &apos; office .
is he there ?
look , Bruce . I don &apos;t want you to carry that check in your pocket .
well , because ...
Yes , yes , I know all that . but ...
there &apos;s an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get , you put in the lining of your hat .
in your hat . it brings good luck .
I &apos;ve been a reporter for 20 years . I never heard that .
neither did I. I know it sounds silly , dear , but do it for me .
Yes , yes , right now .
all right . just a minute .
there , I &apos;ve done it .
anything else ?
Oh , yes .
all right .
Yes , I &apos;ll tell him . Goodbye .
everything all right ?
Hildy said she &apos;ll get right to work .
- Fine .
- I must be going now .
you don &apos;t want to forget this . it might rain , you know .
thanks . you mind if I don &apos;t show you out ?
I &apos;m so busy in here .
thanks for everything .
- What did you say ?
- Thanks for everything .
nonsense . don &apos;t thank me . I should thank you .
- So long .
- So long .
Hello , Cooley .
what are you doing here ?
I want an interview with Earl Williams .
- No more interviews .
- Why not ?
sheriff &apos;s orders . besides , a doctor &apos;s coming over . can &apos;t do it .
say , is this your money ?
- I don &apos;t think it is .
- Twenty bucks ?
- I guess it is .
- That &apos;s what I thought .
come on , I &apos;m in a hurry .
open up here .
- Now , Hildy , don &apos;t be ...
- I won &apos;t be long .
- Hello , Earl .
- Hello .
my name &apos;s Johnson . mind if I talk to you for a few minutes ?
no , I haven &apos;t anything else to do .
I guess that &apos;s right .
so I couldn &apos;t plead insanity . I &apos;m just as sane as anybody else .
you didn &apos;t mean to kill that policeman ? of course not .
it &apos;s against everything I stand for .
they know it was an accident . I &apos;m not guilty .
it &apos;s just the world .
I see what you mean .
sorry about the lipstick , Earl . now , look , after you lost your job ...
- ... what did you do ?
- I tried to find another job .
I mean , how did you spend your time ?
I used to sit around in the park , anyplace . I don &apos;t smoke .
when you were in the park , did you hear any speeches ?
you mean those fellows that talk too much ?
I didn &apos;t pay any attention ...
did you hear anything they said ?
Yes .
is there anything in particular you remember ?
- There was one fellow .
- What did he talk about ?
he talked about production for use .
production for use ?
Yes , he said everything should be made use of .
makes sense , doesn &apos;t it ?
Yes , I liked him . he was a good speaker .
when you found yourself with that gun in your hand and that policeman coming at you , what did you think about ?
I don &apos;t know exactly .
could it have been &quot; production for use &quot; ?
- I don &apos;t know . l ...
- What &apos;s a gun for , Earl ?
a gun ?
why , to shoot , of course .
and maybe that &apos;s why you used it .
- Maybe .
- It seems reasonable .
Yes , yes , it is .
I &apos;ve never had a gun in my hand before .
and that &apos;s what a gun &apos;s for , isn &apos;t it ?
- Maybe that &apos;s why ...
- Sure , it is .
that &apos;s what I thought of . &quot; production for use &quot; . it &apos;s simple , isn &apos;t it ?
- Very simple .
- There &apos;s nothing crazy about that .
- Nothing at all .
- Write about that in your paper .
you bet I will . who sent you the roses ?
Miss Mollie Malloy . she &apos;s wonderful ...
is that her picture ?
- Yes . she &apos;s beautiful , isn &apos;t she ?
- Time &apos;s up , Hildy .
all right .
guess that &apos;s all .
I liked talking to you . Goodbye , Miss Johnson .
Goodbye , Earl .
good luck .
- Three landladies , boys .
- Got well , didn &apos;t you ?
I wonder what the Post will do without Hildy ?
you suppose Walter Burns will ever let her go ?
remember when Fenton wanted to go to Hollywood ?
- Had him thrown in jail for arson .
- Forgery .
- Was that it ?
- Yeah , give me some change .
Hey , Mac .
Hey , Stairway Sam .
would you mind turning on some lights ?
it &apos;s so dark , you can &apos;t see anything .
who &apos;s this guy Hildy &apos;s marrying ?
I don &apos;t know . Bruce something .
- I give the marriage six months .
she won &apos;t be able to be away from the paper any longer .
did you see her when that bell went off ?
it must be pretty nice to be able to walk out of a place and quit .
I had a publicity job offered to me last year . I should have taken it .
that &apos;s what I &apos;d like , a job on the side .
a desk and a stenographer . I wouldn &apos;t mind a nice , big blonde .
with big brown eyes .
I &apos;ll bet you ten to one it don &apos;t last six months .
she &apos;s just like us , or we wouldn &apos;t be waiting for that guy to dance .
- Miss Mollie Malloy .
- Hello , Mollie . how &apos;s tricks ?
- I &apos;ve been looking for you tramps .
- Come to pay a call on Williams ?
nice roses you sent Earl . what do you want done with them tomorrow ?
a lot of wise guys , ain &apos;t you ?
you &apos;re breaking up the game . what do you want ?
I came to ...
I came to tell you what I think of you . all of you .
keep your shirt on .
if you was worth breaking my nails on , I &apos;d tear your face open .
what are you sore about ?
wasn &apos;t that a swell story we gave you ?
you crumbs have been making a fool out of me long enough .
I never said I loved Earl , and was willing to marry him on the gallows .
you made that up .
and about my being his soul mate and having a love nest with him .
you &apos;ve been around that cuckoo since they threw him in the death house .
- That &apos;s a lie .
- Everybody knows you &apos;re his girlfriend .
I met Mr. Williams just once in my life .
when he was wandering in the rain without his hat and coat on like a sick dog , the day before the shooting .
give me one .
I went up to him like any human being would and asked him what was the matter .
he told me about being fired after being on the job for 14 years .
- Who bets ?
- Bet 20 cents .
I brought him up to my room because it was warm .
put it on a phonograph .
listen to me , please .
I tell you he just sat there talking to me all night .
he never once laid a hand on me .
and in the morning he went away and I never saw him again till that day of the trial .
- Sure , I was his witness .
- And what a witness .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re persecuting me .
because Earl treated me decent , and not like an animal .
- He &apos;s got a nice room .
- Not for long .
he left a call for 7 a.m .
it &apos;s a wonder lightning don &apos;t come down and strike you all dead .
what &apos;s that ?
they &apos;re fixing up a pain in the neck for your boyfriend .
shame on you .
shame on you !
a poor little fellow that never meant nobody no harm .
sitting with the angel of death , and you cracking jokes .
you &apos;re going to get out of here .
- Take your hands off me !
- Let &apos;s get out of here .
they ain &apos;t human .
- I know . they &apos;re newspapermen .
- All they &apos;ve been doing is lying .
all they &apos;re doing is writing lies .
why won &apos;t they listen to me ?
why won &apos;t they listen to me ?
who ?
Hildy Johnson ?
hang on . she &apos;ll be back in a minute .
you guys want to play any more cards ?
what &apos;s the use ?
I can &apos;t win anyway .
gentlemen of the press .
Hildy .
phone for you .
what ?
where are you ?
you &apos;re where ?
well , how did that happen ?
never mind , never mind . I &apos;ll be right down .
I &apos;m sorry , Pete . sorry .
Hi , Sheriff . how you doing ?
my shin and my back . what &apos;s going on around here ?
- Bruce was in trouble .
- Lioness rushes to defend cub .
man forgets hankie . mama goes to wipe nose .
I still give that marriage six months .
I don &apos;t know what you fellows are talking about .
what do you want , Pete ?
Oh , I got the tickets for the hanging here , boys .
- Pete ?
- What ?
why can &apos;t you hang this guy at five o &apos;clock instead of seven ?
it won &apos;t hurt you , and we can make the city edition .
that &apos;s kind of raw , Roy hanging a man in his sleep to please a newspaper .
but you can reprieve him twice so he hangs three days before election .
and you can run on a law-and-order ticket .
I had absolutely nothing to do with those reprieves .
how do we know there won &apos;t be another tonight ?
what if Egelhoffer finds Williams insane ?
he won &apos;t find him insane , because he isn &apos;t . he &apos;s just as sane as I am .
Saner !
be serious , boys . after all , this is a hanging .
and it &apos;s going to go according to schedule .
seven o &apos;clock in the morning and not a minute earlier .
there &apos;s such a thing as being humane , you know .
all right , Pinky . wait until you want a favor .
- And please don &apos;t call me Pinky .
- Why not ?
because I got a name , see , and it &apos;s Peter B. Hartwell .
- What &apos;s the &quot; B &quot; for ? - Bull .
but I &apos;m innocent . I didn &apos;t do it . I never stole a watch in my life !
I know you didn &apos;t , Bruce . Mike , let him out .
I can &apos;t . he &apos;s accused of stealing a watch they found on him .
- But I never stole ...
- Please , Bruce .
all right , you &apos;re not . read the Post in the morning .
I can &apos;t imagine who &apos;d do a thing like that to me .
- I can &apos;t think of any enemies .
- I &apos;m sure you haven &apos;t any ...
- Have you got the check ?
- Oh , yes , I have it right here .
that &apos;s a funny superstition you newspaper people have .
Yes , isn &apos;t it ?
about being arrested , I thought maybe Walter Burns might have something to do with it .
but then , of course , I realized he couldn &apos;t have .
- Why ?
- He &apos;s a very nice fellow .
Oh , yes , I found that out .
- What &apos;s the matter ?
- I &apos;ve lost my wallet .
Yes ?
well , Bruce , never mind . I have the money .
better give me the check too . and that picture of us in Bermuda .
don &apos;t bother , Bruce . you &apos;ll find lots of things missing .
wait here . I &apos;m not taking any more chances .
I &apos;ll be down in three minutes . we &apos;ll take the next train . sorry .
&quot; and so into this little tortured mind came the idea that that gun had been produced for use .
and use it he did .
but the state has a production for use plan too . it has a gallows .
and at 7 a.m. , unless a miracle occurs , that gallows will be used to separate the soul of Earl Williams from his body .
and out of Mollie Malloy &apos;s life will go the one kindly soul she ever knew &quot; .
that &apos;s as far as she got .
but can that girl write an interview ?
she &apos;ll do till somebody else comes along .
it &apos;s not ethical , reading other people &apos;s stuff .
where you get that ethics stuff ?
you &apos;re the only one who &apos;ll swipe any of it .
I say anybody that can write like that won &apos;t give it up to sew socks for a guy in the insurance business .
now I give that marriage 3 months and I &apos;m laying 3-1 .
- Any takers ?
- I &apos;ll take that bet .
a girl can &apos;t leave the room without being discussed by old ladies .
Hello , Post ?
get me Walter Burns , will you , please ?
don &apos;t get sore . we were only saying a reporter like you wouldn &apos;t quit so easy .
this is Hildy Johnson . I can quit all right , without a single quiver .
I &apos;ll live like a human being , not like you chumps .
is that you ?
I &apos;ve got some news for you .
I got the interview , but I &apos;ve got some more important news .
better get a pencil and take it down .
all ready ?
now , get this , you double-crossing chimpanzee .
your check leaves with me in 20 minutes .
I wouldn &apos;t cover the burning of Rome for you .
and if I ever lay my eyes on you again I &apos;ll hammer on your monkey skull so it rings like a Chinese gong !
you don &apos;t know why I &apos;m angry ?
get Louie to tell you about his watch .
and there &apos;s just one other little thing .
hear that ?
that &apos;s the story I just wrote .
I know we had a bargain . I said I &apos;d write it .
I didn &apos;t say I wouldn &apos;t tear it up . it &apos;s all in little pieces now .
and I hope to do the same for you someday .
that &apos;s my farewell to the newspaper game .
I &apos;ll be a woman . not a news machine .
I &apos;ll have babies , give them cod-liver oil and watch their teeth grow .
and if I ever see one of them look at a paper , I &apos;ll brain him .
where &apos;s my hat ?
- Mr. Burns ?
Yes , she &apos;s still here . - Give me that .
and another thing I want ...
where is my ...
there it is .
- Hello , Doctor . sorry to be late .
- Quite all right .
these boys from the newspapers take up my time .
they wanted me to hang Williams at their convenience .
- Oh , hello , Earl .
- These newspapers .
- What they did to me in Chicago !
- I believe it .
- Always after me for interviews .
- Me too .
I did promise to make some sort of statement when I finished here .
it is hardly ethical . all statements are supposed to come from me .
I see . what do you say to giving them some sort of joint interview ?
I can discuss some of the psychological aspects of the case and you ...
we &apos;d have our pictures taken together ?
- Shaking hands .
- Splendid idea !
I don &apos;t take a good picture .
that doesn &apos;t matter . publicity &apos;s the thing .
doctor , I &apos;m getting awful tired .
can &apos;t I go back to jail again ?
I &apos;m sorry . I forgot you were there . no , we &apos;ve further questions for you .
sheriff , would you extinguish the lights ?
that will help with what we &apos;re doing here . now , let me see .
Mr. Williams , you know , of course , that you are going to be executed .
who do you feel is responsible for that ?
I am innocent . it wasn &apos;t my fault .
- Well , Murph .
- Send a post card , kid .
- Goodbye .
- Au revoir , Hildegarde .
when will we see you again ?
next time you see me , I &apos;ll be in a Rolls Royce giving interviews on success .
so long , you wage slaves .
when you &apos;re climbing fire escapes , getting kicked out front doors and eating in one-armed joints don &apos;t forget your pal , Hildy Johnson .
and when the road beyond unfolds , and the work ...
look out !
it &apos;s a jailbreak !
what &apos;s the matter ?
what happened ?
watch where you &apos;re aiming , will you ?
watch the gate !
he &apos;ll try the gate !
who got away ?
who was it ?
- Earl Williams !
- Who did he say ?
Earl Williams !
Hello , hello !
hurry up , this is important .
- Flash ! Earl Williams just escaped .
- Jailbreak !
Williams went over the wall !
I don &apos;t know anything yet .
Hello , Post ?
give me Walter Burns , quick . Hildy Johnson .
Walter ?
Walter ?
Hildy .
Earl Williams just escaped from the county jail .
don &apos;t worry , I &apos;m on the job .
Hey , Cooley !
wait !
Hey , wait a minute !
Cooley , I want to talk to you !
this is Endicott . give me rewrite .
he ain &apos;t here .
Hello , Gil ?
here &apos;s the situation now .
ready ?
Williams was taken to the sheriff &apos;s to be examined by Egelhoffer .
in a few minutes , he shot his way out .
nobody knows where he got the gun . he got out through the skylight .
he must have slid down the rainpipe . nobody knows where he got it . or they won &apos;t talk .
give me the desk .
the crime commission offers a $ 10,000 reward .
no clue yet as to Williams &apos; whereabouts .
here &apos;s a little feature . an accident about a tear bomb .
Yeah , tear bomb , tear bomb . criminals cry for it .
I don &apos;t know .
the tear bomb went off unexpectedly in the hands of the bombing squad .
the following deputies were rushed to the hospital .
- A fine friend you are .
- Their names are Mervin D. Wilkerson , the mayor &apos;s brother-in-law .
after all I &apos;ve done for you .
Howard Schuster , the sheriff &apos;s uncle .
highlights on Sheriff Hartwell &apos;s manhunt .
William Mansfield , his landlord , and Lester Winthrop who married the sheriff &apos;s niece .
you remember , the very homely dame ?
call you back .
Mrs. William Rice , scrub lady , while scrubbing the eigth floor was shot by one of the sheriff &apos;s deputies .
look , I &apos;m not ...
there goes another scrub lady !
it was only a flesh wound . they took her to the hospital .
- McCue speaking . give me the desk .
- Any dope on how he escaped ?
maybe the sheriff let him out so he could vote for him .
a man answering the description of Earl Williams boarded a southbound ...
call you back .
- I thought you &apos;d gone .
- I thought so too .
get me Walter Burns , quick !
Walter , listen .
I &apos;ve got the story on how Williams escaped , and I &apos;ve got it exclusive .
that &apos;s right , and it &apos;s a pip .
it cost me $ 450 to tear it out of Cooley .
what &apos;s the story ?
I &apos;ll give it to you . but first I have to tell you I gave him money .
and it wasn &apos;t exactly mine .
it &apos;s Bruce &apos;s money and I want it back .
Bruce &apos;s money ?
sure , you &apos;ll get it . now , what &apos;s the story ?
I &apos;ll send the money . I swear it on my mother &apos;s grave .
all right . here &apos;s the ...
wait a minute , your mother &apos;s alive !
my grandmother &apos;s grave . what &apos;s the story ?
you get that money down here .
all right , here &apos;s your story . the jailbreak of your dreams .
this expert , Dr. Egelhoffer , the thinker from New York was giving Williams a sanity test in the sheriff &apos;s office .
sticking a lot of pins in him so he could get his reflexes .
he decided to reenact the crime as it had taken place in order to study Williams &apos; coordination .
I &apos;m coming to it . he had to have a gun to reenact the crime with .
who do you suppose supplied it ?
Peter B. Hartwell . &quot; B &quot; for brains .
no kidding !
I &apos;m not kidding . I &apos;m not good enough to make this up .
the sheriff gave his gun to the professor who gave it to Earl , who shot the professor in the classified ads .
no , ads . ain &apos;t it perfect ?
if he &apos;d unrolled a red carpet and loaned Williams an umbrella it couldn &apos;t have been more ideal .
who ?
Oh , no . Egelhoffer wasn &apos;t badly hurt .
they took him to the hospital , where they &apos;re afraid he &apos;ll recover .
that &apos;s great work , Hildy .
stop worrying about that money . you &apos;ll get it in 15 minutes .
I had better . Bruce is waiting in a taxi for me and we &apos;re in a hurry .
hold on a minute .
Vangie , come here .
there &apos;s a guy in a taxi in front of criminal courts . name &apos;s Bruce Baldwin .
- What does he look like ?
- He looks like Ralph Bellamy .
- Oh , him ?
- Can you handle it ?
I &apos;ve never flopped on you yet , have I ?
come on , get going . you only got about two minutes . hurry .
sorry to keep you waiting . how much was it again ?
$ 450 . well , just a second .
Louie , come here . I need $ 450 worth of counterfeit money .
- Can &apos;t carry that much , boss .
- No , just the $ 450 counterfeit .
I got that on me .
quite a coincidence . take it over to Hildy .
it &apos;s coming . I &apos;m sending it with Louie .
thanks for your story . and good luck on your honeymoon .
no , no , never mind the thanks . just see that money gets here .
- Hildy , you still here ?
- No , I &apos;m in Niagara Falls .
McCue speaking .
Emil , I got a good feature on the manhunt .
ready ?
Mrs. Phoebe DeWolfe , colored , gave birth to a pickaninny in a patrol wagon with Hartwell &apos;s rifle squad acting as nurses .
Phoebe was walking along the street when ... That &apos;s right .
so they coaxed her into the patrol wagon .
when the pickanninny was born , they checked to see if it was Earl Williams .
here &apos;s the payoff . they named the kid Peter Hartwell DeWolfe .
press room .
Bruce ?
I thought you were downstairs in a ...
what ?
arrested again . what for this time ?
well , they called it &quot; mashing &quot; .
no , I didn &apos;t , Hildy !
I was sitting in the taxi where you left me and the young lady seemed to have a dizzy spell and I just ...
she &apos;s kind of ...
Yes , she &apos;s a blonde .
Yes , very blonde .
never mind . I know how it happened . just a minute .
get me Walter Burns . Hildy Johnson .
Bruce , where are you ? Twenty-seventh Precinct ?
hold on a minute .
Walter , you ...
he was there a minute ago .
but I want ...
&quot; I &apos;m sorry , I can &apos;t locate him &quot; .
how about 20 minutes ?
I have to wait here for the ...
I &apos;ll tell you when I see you .
if I ever get my hands on Walter ...
- Anything I can do to help ?
- How much money you got ?
- $ 1.80 .
- 64 cents .
- Welcome to it .
- Thanks , you better buy an annuity .
what &apos;s that , Emil ?
no , I can &apos;t give you an official statement .
no , wait a minute . here &apos;s the mayor . how about a statement , Mayor ?
- Don &apos;t pester me now , please .
- His Honor won &apos;t say anything .
- Have you seen Hartwell ?
- Hard to tell .
there &apos;s so many cockroaches around ...
wait a minute . how about a statement ?
- We go to press in 20 minutes .
- I &apos;ve nothing to say . not now .
just a moment . what do you know about the escape ?
- Where &apos;d he get the gun ?
- Not so fast .
- About the election ...
- What effect will this have ?
none whatsoever .
how can an unavoidable misfortune like this have any influence on the upright citizens of our fair city ?
Mr. Mayor , please , is there a Red Menace or ain &apos;t there ?
how did Williams get out ?
have you picked out somebody to be responsible ?
any truth in the report you &apos;re on Stalin &apos;s payroll ?
the senator claims you sleep in red underwear .
never mind the jokes . don &apos;t forget I &apos;m the mayor and ...
Hartwell , I want to see you !
how &apos;d he get away ?
where &apos;d he get the gun ?
any statement on the Red Uprising tomorrow ?
- Red Uprising ?
- There will be no Red Uprising .
the governor says the situation calls for the militia .
I say anything the governor says is a tissue of lies .
here &apos;s a red-hot statement from the governor .
he claims the mayor and sheriff have shown themselves to be a couple of eight-year-olds playing with fire .
you can quote him as follows :
&quot; it &apos;s lucky for the city that next Tuesday is Election Day as the citizens will thus be saved the expense of impeaching the mayor and the sheriff &quot; .
that &apos;s all . call you back .
nice to have seen you , Mayor .
- Excuse me , I &apos;ve got so much to do .
- Wait . who engineered this getaway ?
- Was it the Reds ?
- Was it you ? me ?
just a minute .
I &apos;ll tell you . I &apos;ve got him located .
- Williams ?
- Where ?
out on Center Street . I just got a tip .
- Why didn &apos;t you say so ?
- The rifle squad is going out .
you &apos;ll catch him if you hurry .
- Look , please ...
- Pete , I want to talk to you .
I &apos;ve got so much to do .
- See here , Fred ...
- Pete , you &apos;re through .
through ?
you mean I &apos;m through ?
I &apos;m scratching your name off the ticket and running Sherman in your place .
&quot; reform the Red with a rope &quot; !
Williams isn &apos;t a Red and you know it !
but there &apos;s Communistic sympathizers and I thought if I got a slogan like that I could ...
that &apos;s got nothing to do with this case .
there are 200,000 votes at stake . if he don &apos;t hang , we &apos;ll lose them .
we &apos;re going to hang him . he can &apos;t get away .
what do you mean ?
he did get away , didn &apos;t he ?
what do you want ?
- What do you want ?
- Are you Sheriff Hartwell ?
I &apos;m him . what is it ?
you &apos;re a hard man to find . I have a message from the governor .
- What ?
- It was a reprieve for Earl Williams .
- For who ?
- Earl Williams .
you said there wasn &apos;t going to be a reprieve .
it frightens me to think of what I &apos;d like to do to you . who was there ?
- Nobody . he was fishing .
- Get the governor on the phone .
he &apos;s not there . he &apos;s duck shooting .
blasted nimrod !
fishing , duck shooting ...
a guy who &apos;s done nothing for the last 40 years gets elected governor and he &apos;s a Tarzan .
read that . &quot; insane &quot; . he knows very well Williams isn &apos;t insane .
I never met the man .
- Pure politics .
- It &apos;s an attempt to ruin us .
what do we tell the reporters ?
tell them the party is through on account of you .
as an afterthought , tell them I want your resignation now .
Hello . Yes , yes , this is Hartwell .
what ?
where ?
holy Moses !
hold the wire !
they &apos;ve got Williams !
the rifle squad has him at his house .
- Tell them to hold the phone .
- Hold the wire .
- Cover up that transmitter .
- No . now , listen .
you never arrived with this .
Yes , I did . I came through that door ...
- How much do you make ?
- I thought he was sheriff ...
- What &apos;s your salary ?
- $ 40 a week .
how &apos;d you like to make $ 350 a month ?
that &apos;s almost $ 100 a week .
I couldn &apos;t afford that . who ?
me ?
they need a fellow like you in the city sealer &apos;s office .
- The what ?
- City sealer &apos;s .
you mean I should work in the sealer &apos;s ...
my wife wouldn &apos;t like that . she lives in the country with my family .
that &apos;s all right . bring her in . we &apos;ll pay all the expenses .
- I don &apos;t think so .
- Why not ?
I got two kids in school . if they change towns , they &apos;ll lose a grade ...
no . they &apos;ll skip a grade .
and I guarantee you that they &apos;ll graduate ...
hold your horses , Olsen . hurry up , Fred .
now , what do you say ?
that puts me in a peculiar hole .
no , it doesn &apos;t . you never delivered this .
you got caught in traffic or something .
- No , I came ...
- Pretend you didn &apos;t .
now get out and don &apos;t let anybody see you .
- But how do I know ...
- Come to my office tomorrow .
- What &apos;s your name ?
- Pettibone .
- Pettibone ?
- Not really .
lay low and keep your mouth shut .
- I &apos;m tired anyhow .
- Go to this address .
nice homey place .
they &apos;ll take care of you . tell them Fred sent you .
- Here &apos;s $ 50 on account .
- Wait , I &apos;ll tell you in one minute .
you forgot to tell me what a city sealer does .
- Is it hard ?
- Easy . very easy .
good , because my health isn &apos;t what my wife ...
- We &apos;ll fix that too .
- My wife ?
Yes , fix anything . go ahead .
they &apos;re still on the phone .
- Tell them to shoot to kill .
- But the reprieve !
- Go ahead and do as I tell you .
- Hello , Olsen .
shoot to kill . that &apos;s the orders . pass the word along .
- $ 500 reward .
- $ 500 for the man who does it .
I &apos;ll be right over .
Hi , Hildy .
you double-crossing hyena .
what &apos;d you pull on Mr. Baldwin this time ?
- Who , me ?
- You and that albino of yours .
- Evangeline &apos;s no albino .
- She &apos;ll do , till one comes along .
she was born in this country .
if she tries anything else , she &apos;ll have to stay in this country .
- Did you bring that money ?
- Oh , yeah , $ 400 .
$ 450 .
all right , you can &apos;t blame a guy for trying .
- Give me a receipt .
- I &apos;ll give you a scar .
you got plenty of them .
I &apos;ll take Mr. Baldwin &apos;s wallet too .
- Mr. Baldwin &apos;s what ?
- His purse . come on , Louie .
all right , Hildy . I &apos;ll do it for you because I like you .
but tell your financier to be more careful , know what I mean ?
I &apos;ll loan him a pair of your brass knuckles .
don &apos;t talk that way . I &apos;ll take that .
- I &apos;ll take it to the station .
- Wait a minute !
take it to the 27th Precinct and tell the cops how this happened .
I couldn &apos;t do that . Burns would turn me in .
- Not a bad idea .
- Here , catch !
Louie !
Hello , operator . Hildy Johnson . will you get me ...
drop that phone !
never mind .
you won &apos;t tell anybody where I am .
put that gun down , Earl .
you don &apos;t want to shoot me . I &apos;m your friend , remember ?
I &apos;m writing the story on you of production for use .
- That &apos;s right .
production for use . - You don &apos;t want to hurt your ...
don &apos;t move !
maybe you &apos;re my friend , maybe not .
but don &apos;t come nearer .
you can &apos;t trust anybody in this crazy world .
I don &apos;t blame you . I wouldn &apos;t trust anybody either .
don &apos;t do that . put it back . put it back .
if you try any tricks , I &apos;ll shoot you . I can do it right from here .
sure you could , Earl . but you don &apos;t want to do that .
you don &apos;t want to kill anybody .
no , you &apos;re right . I don &apos;t want to kill anybody .
- That &apos;s what I thought .
- Wait a minute . where are you going ?
I was going to close the door so nobody &apos;d see you .
no , you weren &apos;t . you were going to get somebody .
but I don &apos;t want that . all I want is to be left alone .
- I won &apos;t get anybody .
- You will .
you &apos;ll get them after me again . I won &apos;t let you do that . I won &apos;t ...
- Give me that .
- I guess I fired all the shells .
- I &apos;m awful tired .
- That shot . they &apos;ll know you &apos;re here .
I don &apos;t care .
I &apos;m not afraid to die . I told the guy that when he handed me the gun .
- Quiet !
- Waking me in the middle of the night .
talking about things they don &apos;t understand .
shut up .
I wish they &apos;d take me back and hang me .
they will if you don &apos;t keep quiet .
I couldn &apos;t go through another day like this .
you think I could ?
get me Walter Burns , quick . tell him I need him .
Bruce , I know I said I &apos;d be down , but something terrific has happened .
Walter , come right away . wait , Bruce , I &apos;ll explain .
I &apos;ve got Earl Williams here , in the press room .
on the level . hurry , I need you !
Bruce , I &apos;ve captured Earl Williams . you know , the murderer .
stay there , Earl . wait . Bruce , I &apos;ll be down .
as soon as I hand him to the paper .
Bruce , I can &apos;t . don &apos;t you realize ...
- Who is it ?
- Me , Mollie Malloy . open the door !
- What do you want , Mollie ?
- I got to find ...
- Where is everybody ?
- They &apos;ve gone .
please tell me where .
I don &apos;t know , and I &apos;m awfully busy .
they got him surrounded . they &apos;ll shoot him down like a dog .
they &apos;re looking for you too .
I don &apos;t care . tell me . I ain &apos;t afraid of them .
all right , they &apos;re down at Center Street and Fourth .
- Oh , that &apos;s where I used to ...
- Mollie , Mollie , don &apos;t go .
come in , Mollie . draw up a chair .
- Hello .
- How did you get in here ?
down the pipe . I didn &apos;t mean to shoot him . really , I didn &apos;t .
- Be quiet .
- You believe me , don &apos;t you ?
sure , I believe you .
thanks for the roses . they were beautiful .
that &apos;s all right , Mr. Williams .
- Don &apos;t cry .
- Don &apos;t you get hysterical .
I want to get him out .
- You wouldn &apos;t get down that hall .
- But they &apos;ll find him .
I know . I &apos;m trying to think before those reporters come back .
let them take me . what &apos;s the difference ?
I &apos;ll never let them .
who locked the door ?
- Now it &apos;s too late .
- It isn &apos;t . get in this desk .
- Oh , what &apos;s the use ?
- Come on , get in .
we &apos;ll get you out in ten minutes .
pull yourself together . all right , here . sit down .
all right , all right , I &apos;m coming !
- Don &apos;t kick the building down .
- We got phone calls to make .
what &apos;s she doing up here ?
what &apos;s the matter ?
came up here and had hysterics .
- How do you feel , kid ?
- Not so good .
get you some water ?
- Do anything for you ?
- You don &apos;t look so sick .
- Did you bump into Williams ?
- Funny !
- Where is he ?
- Let me alone .
- Okay . give me the desk .
- No harm in asking .
Hello , Jim . Yes , false alarm . they surrounded the house , all right but Williams wasn &apos;t there .
the Halloween outside has the police standing on its ear .
- I thought you were gone .
- I &apos;m waiting for money from Walter .
what a chase !
give me Emil .
- Give me the desk .
- Any news , boys ?
Yeah , I never been so tired in my life .
what ?
where ?
Melrose Station ?
all right , connect me . Hello , Mollie . how are you ?
hold it a minute . this looks good .
an old lady claims Williams is hiding under her piazza .
tell her to stand up .
- You want to go out on it ?
- I &apos;ll cover this end .
- I spent $ 1.40 on taxicabs already .
- No more going out .
- Never mind , Sarge .
- Who pulled the shades down ?
they were throwing those lights around .
you know , I &apos;ve got a hunch Williams ain &apos;t anywhere they &apos;ve been looking for him .
he might be here in this building .
sure , sure , hanging around like a duck in a shooting gallery .
from the skylight , but how did he reach the ground ?
- I &apos;m pretending there ain &apos;t any Earl .
- He could have jumped to this roof .
from the roof he could slide down the drainpipe .
and come in any of these windows . if the story walks in the window ...
masterminds . why don &apos;t you go home ?
maybe Williams will call on you .
it &apos;d be funny if he was in this building .
why not search the building ?
- I am not wandering all over .
- A great bunch of reporters you are .
too lazy to go after the biggest story in years .
you seem pretty anxious to get rid of us .
- Are you trying to scoop us ?
- Are you crazy ?
on my time ?
maybe Mollie &apos;s been giving her the truth on how Williams got the gun .
I didn &apos;t do nothing .
- Come clean .
- Let the girl alone . she &apos;s ...
well ?
Mrs. Baldwin . mother .
don &apos;t &quot; mother &quot; me . playing cat and mouse and keeping my boy locked up .
making us miss two trains , and you supposed to be married tomorrow .
- I &apos;ll be with you in five minutes ...
- Just give me Bruce &apos;s money .
you can stay here forever , you and that murderer you caught .
- Murderer ?
- Which one of these men is it ?
- They all look like murderers .
- What murderer did you catch ?
I never said any such thing .
I &apos;m quoting my son . he has never lied to me .
somebody &apos;s lying .
- I never said anything like that .
- Yes , you did .
I said I was trying to find the murderer .
- Quit stalling .
- She &apos;s got it balled up .
who are you holding out on ?
nobody . now let me go , will you ?
stop it , stop it !
she don &apos;t know where he is . I &apos;m the only one that knows .
- Where &apos;s Williams ?
- Try and find out .
- Come on , talk .
- Now you want me to talk ?
- Talk .
- Ain &apos;t that funny ?
you wouldn &apos;t listen to me before , and now you want me to talk .
don &apos;t say anything .
- I know what I &apos;m doing .
- Stay out of this .
- Why didn &apos;t you listen to me ?
- Cut that out .
- Hands off !
- Where is he ?
why do you want to know ?
so you can write more lies to sell papers ?
- Never mind that .
- All right . I &apos;ll give you a story .
a wonderful story !
only this time it &apos;ll be true . you &apos;ll never find me now !
get the ambulance , somebody !
get an ambulance , somebody !
- She &apos;s dead .
- No , she isn &apos;t killed , she &apos;s moving !
- Did you see that ?
she jumped .
- I know that .
where have you got Williams ?
hidden . he &apos;s in the desk .
she didn &apos;t kill herself .
- How &apos;re you doing ?
- Let me out .
quiet . you &apos;re sitting pretty .
- What &apos;s in there ?
- Who are you ?
- This is Bruce &apos;s mother .
- What are you doing ?
- Shut up !
- You &apos;re doing something wrong .
- Mother , please .
- Take her out of here .
- Take the lady to Polack Mike &apos;s .
- My name &apos;s Louie Peluso .
see that she doesn &apos;t talk to anyone . tell them it &apos;s a case of D.T. &apos; s .
don &apos;t worry , Mother . it &apos;s only temporary .
let go of me .
- Where are you going ?
- To get Bruce out of jail .
- Why did you do this to me ?
- Get Bruce out of jail ?
how can you worry about a man who &apos;s resting in a police station ?
- This is war !
you can &apos;t desert me .
- Get off that trapeze .
you &apos;ve got your story .
&quot; Earl Williams captured by the Morning Post &quot; .
I covered your story for you , now I &apos;m getting out .
you drooling idiot , there are 365 days in a year one can get married .
how many times you got a murderer locked up in a desk ?
you got the whole city by the seat of the pants .
you &apos;ve got the brain of a pancake .
this isn &apos;t just a story . it &apos;s a revolution .
the greatest yarn since Livingston discovered Stanley .
- The other way around .
- Don &apos;t get technical at such a time .
you &apos;ve taken a city that &apos;s been graft-ridden for 40 years and given us a chance to have the same kind of government New York has under La Guardia .
if I didn &apos;t have your best interest at heart , I wouldn &apos;t argue with you .
you &apos;ve done something big . you &apos;ve stepped up into a new class .
we &apos;ll make such monkeys of those ward healers nobody &apos;ll vote for them .
- Expose them ?
- We &apos;ll crucify that mob .
we &apos;ll keep Williams under cover , until we can break the story then share the glory with the governor .
- I get it , I get it .
- You &apos;ll kick over City Hall .
you got the mayor and Hartwell backed up against the wall .
this isn &apos;t just a newspaper story . it &apos;s a career !
and you bellyache about catching the eight or nine o &apos;clock train .
- But I never figured it that way .
- Because you &apos;re a doll-faced hick .
they &apos;ll be naming streets after you . there &apos;ll be statues of you .
the movies will be after you . there &apos;ll be a Hildy Johnson cigar .
I can see the billboards now :
&quot; light up with Hildy Johnson ... &quot;
- We got a lot to do .
- Now you &apos;re talking .
- We can &apos;t leave Williams here .
- We &apos;ll take him to my private office .
- How are you going to take him ?
- We &apos;ll carry the desk over .
it &apos;s crawling with cops outside .
we &apos;ll lower it out the window with pulleys . start pounding out a lead !
- How much of this stuff do you want ?
- All you the words you got .
- Can I call the mayor a bird of prey ?
- Call him anything you like .
give him the works . Hello , Duffy ?
we got the biggest story in years .
&quot; Earl Williams captured by the Morning Post . exclusive ! &quot;
tear out the whole front page .
the whole front page . out !
and never mind the European war .
we got something bigger than that . Hildy Johnson &apos;s writing the lead .
and get hold of Butch O &apos;Connor .
tell him to come up here with his wrestlers .
Yeah , Butch O &apos;Connor . what ?
I &apos;ve got a desk I want moved ...
what the deuce do you want ?
- Hello , Bruce .
- Hildy .
never mind the Chinese earthquake .
- I just want to ask you ...
- How &apos;d you get out of jail ?
not through any help of yours . I &apos;m not talking to you .
I had to wire Albany for $ 100 so I could get out on bail .
what will they think in Albany ?
the money went to the police station .
- We &apos;re waiting for that story .
- We &apos;ll explain everything to them .
- Where &apos;s mother ?
- She left .
I can &apos;t hear you .
- Where &apos;d she go ?
- Out someplace .
- Junk the Polish Corridor !
- Tell me where my mother was going .
- She couldn &apos;t say .
- This is more important .
- Did she get the money ?
- She left in a hurry .
- I &apos;ll take that money .
- In my purse .
I can handle things . I &apos;ll take that certified check too .
I &apos;ll give you the tickets . you &apos;ll find your money in the wallet .
my wallet ?
this is my wallet .
say , there &apos;s something funny going on ...
what are you doing ?
just wanted to look at it .
Hildy , I &apos;m taking ...
- I &apos;m taking the 9 o &apos;clock train .
- Sure , sure .
did you hear what I said ?
I said I am taking the 9 o &apos;clock ...
Oh , Bruce , I put it in here !
let her alone , will you , buddy .
- Do me a favor ...
- Just answer one question .
you don &apos;t want to come with me , do you ?
answer me . you don &apos;t , do you ?
no . take the Miss America pictures off page six .
Hildy , tell me . tell me the truth .
wait a minute . now look here , my good man ...
you shut up , Burns .
you &apos;re doing all this to her . she wanted to get away from you .
but you caught her and changed her mind ...
stick Hitler on the funny page . now let me ask you ...
will you give up everything for a man like him ?
no , but something &apos;s happened . I &apos;ll tell you ...
tell him nothing . he &apos;s a spy , you fool .
- I am not a spy .
- Ridiculous .
you &apos;re coming with me right now .
just a second . this is the biggest thing in my life .
I see . I &apos;ll keep . I &apos;m like something in the icebox .
you just don &apos;t love me .
that isn &apos;t true . just because you won &apos;t listen you say I don &apos;t love you .
you never intended to be decent and live like a human being .
all right , if that &apos;s what you want to think .
I &apos;m trying to concentrate .
- You &apos;re just like him and all the rest .
- Sure . that &apos;s what I am .
what ?
leave the rooster story alone . that &apos;s human interest .
if you had any sympathy or understanding ...
- I understand , all right ... - Wait a minute .
there &apos;s one question I want to know . the mayor &apos;s first wife &apos;s name .
the one with the wart on her ?
Fanny . what , Duffy ?
you never loved me at all .
never mind . you don &apos;t work for advertising .
if you change your mind , I &apos;m on the 9 o &apos;clock train .
if you want me , take me as I am . don &apos;t try to change me .
I &apos;m no suburban bridge player . I &apos;m a newspaperman .
that &apos;s it . keep it coming as fast as you can .
get back in there , you mock turtle .
you tell Butch it &apos;s a matter of life and death ?
good . Butch &apos;s on his way . we just have to hold out for 15 minutes .
- The boys will be back to phone .
- I &apos;ll handle them .
God , now the moon &apos;s out .
fine . three taps is me . don &apos;t forget .
- Not very much .
- That better ?
you &apos;re sitting pretty .
- How &apos;s it coming ?
- All right . where &apos;s Bruce ?
- He went out .
- Is he coming back here ?
certainly . didn &apos;t you hear him ?
what have you got so far ?
&quot; while Hartwell &apos;s paid gunmen stalked the city , shooting bystanders spreading terror , Williams was lurking ... &quot;
wait a minute . aren &apos;t you going to mention the Post ?
- I did . second paragraph .
- Who reads the second paragraph ?
how long have I been telling you how to write a story ?
I &apos;m sorry .
what &apos;s the idea of locking this door ?
- Who &apos;s that ?
- Bensinger . that &apos;s his desk .
open the door , will you ?
- What &apos;s his name ?
- Bensinger , of the Tribune .
- The Tribune ?
- Who &apos;s in there ?
haven &apos;t you any better sense ... ?
Hello . Hello , Mr. Burns . quite an honor having you come over here .
- Hello , Bensinger .
- You know my ...
I just want to get my ...
it &apos;s quite a coincidence seeing you tonight , isn &apos;t it ?
how do you mean ?
I was talking to our Mr. Duffy about you this afternoon .
really ?
nothing detrimental , I hope .
on the contrary . on the contrary .
that was one swell story you had in the paper this morning .
did you care for the poem , Mr. Burns ?
the poem ?
the poem was great .
I liked the ending especially .
&quot; and all is well outside his cell but in his heart he hears the hangman calling the gallows falling and his white-haired mother &apos;s tears &quot; .
- Heartbreaking ?
- That &apos;s fine .
would you like to work for me ?
we can use a man like you .
all we got are lowbrows like Johnson here .
- Are you serious , Mr. Burns ? - Serious ?
wait a minute .
Duffy , I &apos;m sending Mr. Bunsinger over to see you .
- Bensinger .
- Mervyn , isn &apos;t it ?
- Yeah ... No .
Roy . Roy V .
- Certainly .
Roy V. Bensinger , the poet .
you wouldn &apos;t know . you probably never heard of Shakespeare either .
put Mr. Bensinger on staff . how much you getting on the Tribune ?
- $ 75 .
- I &apos;ll give you $ 100 and a byline .
now you give him everything he wants , you understand ?
Roy , write me a story from the point of view of the escaped man .
he hides , afraid of every sound , every light .
he hears footsteps , they &apos;re closing in .
- Get the sense of the animal at bay .
- Sort of Jack London style ?
- I &apos;ll get my rhyming dictionary .
- It doesn &apos;t have to rhyme .
I &apos;m deeply grateful , Mr. Burns .
if there &apos;s an opening for a war correspondent I parler a little French .
- I &apos;ll keep you in mind .
- Au revoir , mon capitain .
Bonjour .
&quot; his white-haired mother &apos;s tears &quot; . that &apos;s the tops .
listen , that fellow Bensinger is on his way right now .
handle him with kid gloves . have him write poetry .
we don &apos;t want him . stall him until the extra &apos;s out .
say his poetry smells and kick him downstairs .
- Double-crosser .
- That &apos;ll teach him .
he won &apos;t quit his paper without giving notice after this .
- I mean you .
you &apos;d double-cross anybody ...
wait a minute .
Bruce isn &apos;t coming back . he said he was taking the 9 : 00 train .
in that case , he &apos;s gone by now .
don &apos;t sit there like a frozen robin . get on with the story .
we ought to be finished when Butch gets here .
how you have messed up my life . what am I going to do ?
window &apos;s too small . we &apos;ll carry the desk out .
I &apos;d be on that train right now . I &apos;m a sap , falling for your line .
- They &apos;ll name streets after me ...
- Yes , well , get back to work .
I &apos;m not going back to work . Walter , what ... ?
- Who is it ?
- It &apos;s me , boss . it &apos;s Louie .
Louie .
- What &apos;s the matter ?
- Where &apos;s Mrs. Baldwin ?
what happened ?
down Western Avenue , we was going 65 miles an hour , know what I mean ?
where &apos;s the old lady ?
we run smack into a police patrol . busted it in half .
was she hurt ?
can you imagine bumping into a load of cops ?
- What did you do with her ?
- Search me , when I come to ...
you were with her . you were in the cab .
- The driver got knocked cold .
- Butterfingers !
- You handed her over to the cops .
- What do you mean ? they was on the wrong side of the street .
fine . now she &apos;s probably squawking to the police .
she &apos;s not squawking much . know what I mean ?
don &apos;t tell me ...
was she killed ?
was she ?
did you notice ?
me with a gun on the hip and a kidnapped lady on my hands I &apos;m going to ask questions from cops ?
- You know what I mean ?
- Dead , dead . this is the end !
it &apos;s fate . what will be will be .
what am I going to say to Bruce ?
what can I tell him ?
if he loves you , you won &apos;t have to tell him anything .
would you rather have had the old dame drag the police in here ?
I killed her . I &apos;m responsible .
what am I going to do ?
how can I ever face Bruce again ?
- Look at me , Hildy .
- I am looking at you , you murderer .
if it was my own grandmother , I &apos;d carry on .
- You know I would , for the paper .
- Louie , where &apos;d it happen ?
Western and 34th .
- I got to get out of here ...
- We can do more here . be calm .
listen ...
- Hello , hello .
- Maine 4557 .
who ?
Butch , where are you ?
mission Hospital ?
receiving room .
what are you doing there ?
was an old lady brought in from a smashup ?
for H. Sebastian , Butch , it &apos;s a matter of life and death .
- Nobody ?
- I can &apos;t hear .
- Morningside 2469 .
- You got who ?
speak up . a what ?
you can &apos;t stop for a dame now !
I don &apos;t care if you &apos;ve been after her . our lives are at stake !
are you going to let a woman come between us ?
was there an old lady brought in in an auto smashup ?
Butch , I &apos;d put my arm in fire for you up to here .
you can &apos;t double-cross me .
look around , please .
all right , put her on . I &apos;ll talk to her .
good evening , madam . now , listen , you ten-cent glamour girl you can &apos;t keep Butch from his duty .
what &apos;s that ?
you say that again , I &apos;ll kick you in the teeth !
say , what kind of language is that ?
now , look here , you ...
she hung up . what did I say ?
Duffy , how do you like that ?
Mousing around with some big ...
- Will you shut up ?
I &apos;m trying to hear ! - Duffy !
that &apos;s cooperation .
well , where is Duffy ?
Diabetes . I ought to know better than to hire anybody with a disease .
give me Olympia 2136 , will you ?
- Yes , boss .
- Louie , it &apos;s up to you .
- Anything you say , boss .
- Get a hold of some guys .
anybody with hair on his chest , get them off the street .
we got to get that desk out .
is it important ?
you &apos;re the best friend I got .
- I like you too .
- Then don &apos;t fail me .
get enough people to move that desk .
you know me . shirt off my back .
okay , don &apos;t bump into anything .
- Dumb immigrant is sure to flop on me .
- Try the hospital again .
if he &apos;s not back in five , we &apos;ll carry it alone .
- Do anything you want .
- There &apos;s a million ways .
- We can have firemen take it out .
- I don &apos;t care what you do .
- Come here . see if we can lift it . - What ?
nobody ?
never mind .
- Are you going to help me ?
- No !
- I &apos;ll strain my back .
- I &apos;ll find Mrs. Baldwin .
- Don &apos;t open that door !
- I &apos;ll go to the morgue ...
- We want to talk to you a minute .
- Let go . what &apos;s the idea ?
get your hands off me !
- Now look here , Johnson ...
- Hey , you !
you mean me ?
Yes , you . what do you mean by breaking in here like this ?
don &apos;t bluff me . I don &apos;t care what paper you &apos;re editor of .
let go of me . something &apos;s happened to my mother-in-law .
- We know what you are up to .
- She and Mollie were in here talking .
I don &apos;t know anything . and there &apos;s been an accident .
there &apos;s something very peculiar going on here .
- Now see here ...
- Just a moment , Hartwell .
make your accusations in the proper manner .
otherwise , I &apos;ll have to ask you to get out .
ask me to what ? get out .
you will , eh ?
don &apos;t let anybody in or out . we &apos;ll see about this .
- Give him the third degree .
- Make them talk and you got Williams .
I &apos;m going to get to the bottom of this . are you going to talk ?
- What do you want me to say ?
- What do you know about Williams ?
there . now we &apos;re getting some ...
take her away . I got ways to make her talk .
don &apos;t you dare touch me or ...
- She got a gun !
- Grab it !
no , you don &apos;t . Walter !
all right , Burns . I &apos;ll take that gun .
- Where did you get this ?
- I can carry a gun .
- Not this gun .
- I can explain it .
she was interviewing Williams , so I gave her a gun to defend herself .
interesting . but this is the gun that Williams shot his way out with .
my good man , are you trying to make me out a liar ?
I ought to know my own gun , oughtn &apos;t I ... ?
- So that &apos;s where Williams got it .
- She got it from him .
where &apos;s Williams ? - Where is he ?
- You &apos;re barking up the wrong tree .
tell me where he is .
at the hospital calling on Professor Egelhoffer with marshmallows .
- Where is he ?
- Ask the mastermind why he &apos;s here .
what do you know about this ?
my dear fellow the Morning Post doesn &apos;t obstruct justice or hide criminals .
- You ought to know that .
- You &apos;re under arrest .
- You too .
- Who &apos;s under arrest ?
listen , you square-toed , pimple-headed spy do you realize what you &apos;re doing ?
I &apos;ll show you .
you and the Post are obstructing justice .
I &apos;ll see that you &apos;re fined $ 10,000 .
you &apos;ll see nothing .
I &apos;ll begin by impounding the Post &apos;s property . is this your desk ?
what are you afraid of , Hildy ?
I dare you to move this desk .
- Go ahead , try it .
- I will .
I warn you , you move this desk out of here , I &apos;ll put you behind bars .
- He can do it too .
- I &apos;ll see Roosevelt hears about it .
tell him . come on , boys !
- Confiscate this desk .
- This is your last chance .
this is a federal offense .
we &apos;ll take a chance .
all right .
open up this door !
- Mother !
I &apos;m glad to see you ...
- That &apos;s the man that did it . there .
- What &apos;s the idea here ?
- She claims she &apos;s been kidnapped .
they dragged me down all the way down the stairs and ...
did he do it ?
he was in charge . he told them to kidnap me .
excuse me , madam . are you referring to me ?
you know you did .
what about this ?
kidnapping , huh ?
trying to frame me , huh ?
I never saw her before in my life .
what a thing to say !
I was here when that girl jumped out the window .
get the mayor over here .
look , madam , be honest .
if you were out joyriding plastered , or got into a scrape , why don &apos;t you admit it instead of accusing innocent people ?
you ruffian !
how dare you talk like that to me !
he &apos;s just crazy , Mother .
I &apos;ll tell more . I could tell you why they did it .
they were hiding some kind of murderer in here ...
hiding him ?
in here ?
madam , you &apos;re a cockeyed liar and you know it !
- What &apos;s that ?
- He &apos;s in there !
- Give me the desk .
- What a break !
- Stand back .
- He might shoot .
- Guns out .
- He &apos;s harmless .
don &apos;t take any chances . he can &apos;t hurt anybody , you &apos;ve got his gun .
go on , you gray-haired old weasel .
let me out of here !
mother !
I was looking all over for you . what happened ?
Jake , hang on .
Hildy , call Duffy .
- No !
- You want to see us scooped ?
- Aim right for the center .
- That &apos;s murder .
okay , one of you get on each end of the desk .
- It &apos;s coming up .
- You &apos;re covered .
- In a minute .
- Don &apos;t move .
- Any time now .
- I &apos;ll count three .
it &apos;s hot .
ready ?
any second now .
three . I got you , Williams .
- Go ahead , shoot me .
- Come out .
Earl Williams was just captured in the criminal courts building .
- On your feet .
- Don &apos;t try any funny stuff .
Williams was unconscious .
the police overpowered him .
- He offered no resistance .
- His gun wouldn &apos;t work .
the Post turned Williams over to the sheriff .
- Put the cuffs on them .
- More later .
an anonymous note led to Williams &apos; capture . hold on .
the sheriff &apos;s tracing a call that gave away Williams &apos; hiding place .
- Where &apos;s the old lady ?
- She went out .
call you back .
- Give me the warden &apos;s office .
- You &apos;ll wish you &apos;d never been born .
will I ?
- Hello , Fred .
- Well , fine work , Pete .
- You delivered the goods .
- Looks natural , don &apos;t it ?
- Sight for sore eyes .
- Aiding a criminal .
and a little charge of kidnapping ...
what &apos;s that ?
but that &apos;s the jail .
looks like about ten years apiece for you two birds .
when you think you &apos;ve licked the Post , it &apos;s time to get out .
whistling in the dark won &apos;t help . you &apos;re through .
Archie Leach said that to me a week before he cut his throat .
is that so ?
we &apos;ve been in worse jams than this , haven &apos;t we , Hildy ?
you forget the power that watches over the Post .
- It &apos;s not with you now .
- Says you .
I &apos;ve caught him . Yes , Williams .
single-handed . proceed to the hanging , per schedule .
you &apos;ll be in office exactly two days more .
we &apos;ll pull your nose out of that feedbag .
I tell you what you &apos;ll be doing . making brooms in the penitentiary .
Joe ?
this is Hartwell .
come to my office right away .
I captured a couple of important birds . take their confessions .
get Liebowitz .
the lawyers won &apos;t help you now .
you &apos;re talking to the Morning Post .
the power of the press ?
bigger men than you have found out what the power of the press is .
Presidents , kings ...
- Here &apos;s the reprieve .
- Get out .
- You can &apos;t bribe me . my wife ...
- Get out .
- No , I won &apos;t . here &apos;s the reprieve .
- What ?
I don &apos;t want to be a city sealer .
- Throw him out .
- Out you go .
wait . who &apos;s trying to bribe you ?
- They wouldn &apos;t take it .
- Insane !
what did I say ?
an unseen power .
what do you mean with a story like that ?
he &apos;s an imposter .
trying to hang an innocent man to win an election , eh ?
that &apos;s murder .
- I never saw him before .
- Lf I was to ...
- What &apos;s your name ?
- Pettibone .
- When did you deliver this first ?
- Who &apos;d you talk to ?
- They started to bribe me .
- They ?
- Those . them .
- It &apos;s absurd on the face of it .
he &apos;s talking like a child .
- Out of the mouths of babes .
- Hi , babe .
he &apos;s insane or drunk .
if Williams has been reprieved , I &apos;m tickled to death . aren &apos;t you ?
you &apos;d hang your mother to be reelected .
that &apos;s a horrible thing to say about anybody .
you &apos;re marvelous . take a look at that .
- You &apos;re an intelligent man .
- Never mind .
let &apos;s have your story .
- Nineteen years ago , I married Mrs ...
- Skip all that .
she wasn &apos;t Mrs. Pettibone then . she was one of the ...
this document is authentic . Williams has been reprieved .
our commonwealth has been saved the necessity of shedding blood .
get off the soapbox . save that for the Tribune .
take those handcuffs off my friends .
- I &apos;m amazed at you .
- Isn &apos;t he awful ?
you don &apos;t know how badly I feel .
no excuse at all for Pete .
- I was only doing my duty .
- That &apos;s all right .
- What &apos;d you say your name was ?
- Pettibone .
- Here &apos;s a picture of my wife .
- Fine-looking woman .
- You haven &apos;t seen her yet .
- She &apos;s all right .
she &apos;s good enough for me . if I was to tell ...
I understand perfectly , and as long as I am mayor ...
which ought to be about Three more hours .
enough to get out a special edition asking for your recall .
and your arrest . you boys ought to get about ten years apiece .
don &apos;t make any hasty decisions . you might run into a libel suit .
you &apos;ll run into the governor .
we understand each other perfectly .
Yes , and so do I .
so do you what ?
and now , Mr. Pettibone we &apos;ll deliver this reprieve to the warden &apos;s office .
- Lf I was to tell my wife ...
- You won &apos;t have to .
wait till they read the Morning Post tomorrow .
tight squeeze .
- Give me Duffy .
- That &apos;s the worst jam .
what ?
where ?
get him .
remember stealing Old Lady Haggerty &apos;s stomach off the coroner ?
anytime you need this guy he &apos;s never there .
we proved she &apos;d been poisoned , didn &apos;t we ?
we had to hide out for a week . do you remember that ?
the Shoreland Hotel . that &apos;s how we happened to ...
we could have gone to jail for that too .
Yes , maybe you &apos;re right , Hildy . it &apos;s a bad business .
you &apos;ll be better off . you better get going .
- Where would I go ?
- To Bruce , of course .
- You know he &apos;s gone . he took a train .
- Send a wire .
he &apos;ll be waiting at the station when you get into Albany .
- Why doesn &apos;t he have a phone ?
- I don &apos;t know . I got us messed up ...
- Get going , Hildy .
- What is that with you ?
wait a minute .
can &apos;t you understand ?
I &apos;m trying to do something noble . get out before I change my mind .
it &apos;s tough enough now .
- Just a minute .
- Send him a wire . he &apos;ll be waiting .
- Who &apos;ll write the story ?
- I will . it won &apos;t be as good ...
it &apos;s my story . I like to think that it ...
- At last .
- I get it . the same old act , isn &apos;t it ?
try to push me out , thinking I &apos;ll want to stay .
I know I deserve that . wait a minute , Duffy .
this time you &apos;re wrong .
when you walk out that door , part of me will go right with you .
but a whole new world will open up for you .
I made fun of Bruce and Albany . you know why ?
- Why ?
- I was jealous .
I was sore because he could offer you the kind of life I can &apos;t give you .
that &apos;s what you want , honey .
I could do the story and take the train ...
forget it . come on . come on .
Goodbye , dear , and good luck .
Duffy , now this is how it goes so far ...
just a minute .
Hello . who ?
Hildy Johnson ?
- She just left .
- I &apos;m still here . I can take it .
hang on a minute .
Hildy Johnson speaking .
the Fourth Precinct Police Station ?
I thought you were on your way to Albany ...
what for ?
for having counterfeit money .
counterfeit money ?
hold on a minute .
where did you get it ?
I gave it to you ?
all right . I &apos;ll try and do something about it .
honey .
honey , don &apos;t cry , please .
I didn &apos;t mean to make you cry . what &apos;s wrong ?
you never cried before .
I thought you were really sending me away with Bruce .
I didn &apos;t know you had him locked up .
I thought you were on the level , for once .
that you were just standing by and letting me go off with him and not doing a thing about it .
come on , honey . what did you think I was , a chump ?
I thought you didn &apos;t love me .
what were you thinking with ?
I don &apos;t know .
what are you standing there gawking for ?
we have to get him out of jail .
send Louie down with some honest money and send him back to Albany .
sure .
everything &apos;s changed . we &apos;re coming over to the office .
don &apos;t worry about the story . Hildy will write it .
she never intended to quit . we &apos;re getting married .
can we go on a honeymoon this time ?
sure .
Duffy , you can be managing editor .
not permanently . just for the two weeks we &apos;re away .
I don &apos;t know where . where are we going ?
Niagara Falls .
- Niagara Falls .
- Two whole weeks ?
sure , you &apos;ve earned it . what ?
what ?
a strike ?
what strike ?
where ?
Albany ?
- I know it &apos;s on the way , but ...
- Okay , we &apos;ll honeymoon in Albany .
okay , Duffy .
isn &apos;t that a coincidence !
I wonder if Bruce can put us up .
say , why don &apos;t you carry that in your hand ?
Twenty-six thousand prisoners were taken , as well as inestimable booty .
by scoring several hits , our artillery ... a loaded transport which was about to sail to return to harbor .
another ship exploded under the fire of German anti-tank guns .
state Department in a statement containing the Secretary &apos;s comment ...
- Captain .
... unofficial reports that extensive bombing in Chungking had been received .
anyone left the ship , Donkeyman ?
not as I seen , sir .
- New man ?
- Yes , sir . Smith , signed on at Cape Town .
- Check him onboard .
that crazy light don &apos;t work , sir .
so why didn &apos;t you report it when the lights went out ?
all right , Mister . check everyone in the fo &apos;c&apos;s &apos;le .
Swanson here .
McDonald ?
what ? Oh . Oh , here , sir .
Bergman .
here .
Davis . Davis !
I &apos;m here .
- In here ... - What is it ?
what &apos;s going on ? what are you doing here , steward ?
just turned in for a wink of sleep , sir .
- You &apos;re a mighty quick sleeper ? - Yes , sir .
always was ... - Oh , tick him off . - Yes , sir .
do you always sleep with your clothes on ?
it &apos;s my privilege .
that fellow belong to me .
- Who &apos;s missing ?
- Driscoll , sir .
bunk &apos;s empty . - Where is he , Swanson ?
why ...
he was here just a little while ago , sir .
he went to sleep , I suppose , up on fo &apos;c&apos;s &apos;le head .
I go find him , tell him you want him , huh ?
stay where you are .
I know that you men have been grumbling about shore leave .
when I found the native police had picked up a seaman ashore ,
I guessed it was Driscoll .
me , sir ?
- Did I hear my name , sir ?
- Where have you been ?
I &apos;ve been having a bit of a nap on the fo &apos;c&apos;s &apos;le head , sir .
Oh , it &apos;s a grand evening to be taking a few winks on deck .
with that sun coming over the water , sir , I was dreaming ...
never mind about that . let &apos;s have a look at your hands .
the other one .
the back of it , man .
there &apos;s a native policeman ashore with a broken jaw .
no skin broken , sir .
well , I &apos;m glad for once it &apos;s someone from another ship .
- Kransky .
- Here . - Hansen .
- Geary ?
- Here . - Rido .
what happened , Drisk ?
Dawson put up a bit of a fight .
I &apos;m sneaking back to the boat when two of them native police with their white caps and their brass buttons step out and ask for my pass .
&quot; there &apos;s a war on , &quot; says they , &quot; and you &apos;re not a neutral . &quot;
I never was a ...
I never was a neutral in all my life .
- Well , one word led to another . - What about the ladies ?
the ladies will be aboard any minute now with huge , big baskets of fruit .
fruit ?
Hey , what about the booze ?
under the fruit , there &apos;ll be a bottle or two like this for each one of you .
- By jingo , we get drunk ! - Shut up , you square-head .
Yeah , shut up .
would you have the Mate after us ?
well , I hope you enjoyed it .
I did .
there you are .
there &apos;s a bumboat coming along the side , sir ...
- Right , let them aboard .
- Pardon , sir ?
- Let them aboard .
I suppose you &apos;re wondering why I &apos;m relaxing discipline .
why , no , sir .
it &apos;s none of my business . I thought the First had told you the orders .
they said the ship was being ordered to the United States , sir , to pick up cargo .
- They tell you what the cargo is gonna be ?
- No , sir . it &apos;s ammunition , Mister .
Yes , sir .
come on . get them up .
Hey , get back there .
come on .
Driscoll !
you &apos;re in charge of this party .
and no rough stuff . no , sir .
- You women bring booze ?
- Where &apos;s the liquor ?
hold your horses , ape !
is it trouble you &apos;re after ?
quiet ! all right .
you want the Mate down on our necks to spoil all the fun ?
into the fo &apos;c&apos;s &apos;le with them . go along now . come on .
get out of here . take them in , fellows . go on , fellows .
Hey , he &apos;s cheating !
you make so much noise , mister .
good evening .
you buy from me ?
have you anything to drink ?
thanks .
thanks . thank you very much .
Smitty .
come on ! come on !
come on , baby .
come on , baby .
drink ?
I &apos;ve done my share of drinking in my time .
doctor told me I &apos;d have stop it or die , so I stops .
what &apos;s troubling you , Smitty ?
that singing on the shore getting your nerves ?
if I didn &apos;t know we were in the West Indies ,
I &apos;d imagine we were anchored off some island of the dead .
the ghosts are wailing , Donkeyman .
natives is queer .
I &apos;ve known them to keep on singing like that all night long .
I used to worry a lot about dying . I don &apos;t no more .
take that singing now .
sounds kind of nice and sleepy-like to me .
sleepy ?
if I listen to it much longer sober , I &apos;d never get to sleep .
what &apos;s bothering you , Smitty ?
Oh , memories , Donkeyman .
best thing to do with memories is forget them .
suppose you couldn &apos;t forget them ?
I &apos;d get drunk , same as you &apos;re doing .
whatever set you going to sea on an old tramp like this ?
I suppose there &apos;s a woman mixed up in it , ain &apos;t there ?
- There she is . - Oh , here you are , honey !
you come back !
there &apos;s love for you , Smitty .
no memories joined with that .
every time we get near the land , you get that look on your face .
when a man goes to sea , he ought to give up thinking about things on shore .
land don &apos;t want him no more .
I &apos;ve had my share of things gone wrong , and all come from the land .
now I &apos;m through with the land , and the land &apos;s through with me .
too smoky in fo &apos;c&apos;s &apos;le .
there &apos;s a chap who doesn &apos;t worry about it .
he &apos;s going back to the land at the end of this voyage .
Olsen ?
he &apos;ll never get home .
three times I &apos;ve seen him paid off .
and it &apos;s always one drink with the boys and then ...
after this trip , he &apos;ll stop trying .
Yes , I dare say you &apos;re right .
you &apos;re different from the rest of us .
something on land has still got a hold on you .
it &apos;s you ought to be going home .
you leave me out of it , Donkeyman .
who &apos;s going to leave you out of it when we get back to England ?
I &apos;m not going back .
- The ship is .
you mean you &apos;re going to desert ?
mind your own business , Donkeyman .
play us a tune , you lug !
an Irish tune !
Hey , Ed . want a drink ?
Yeah , thanks .
say , isn &apos;t it great ? we &apos;re gonna booze it on up with a ...
you no dance , senor ?
I no like these men .
I like you .
dance with me , querido .
I be your girl .
dance with ...
I don &apos;t dance .
Oh , Smitty . Smitty , you dog .
gee , I almost popped you . you and me is friends , Smitty , ain &apos;t we ?
- Right you are , Yank .
sure . any pal of mine can have anything I got , Smitty .
anything . and she &apos;s a good-looker , ain &apos;t she , Smitty , huh ?
ain &apos;t she ? come on , honey .
boy , she &apos;s got a lot of fire , too , huh ?
here , have a drink .
go on . Hey , baby , wait minute .
you done that on purpose , you hairy ape .
who you calling a hairy ape ?
you !
you &apos;re a cold punching swab .
well , did you see him ?
what I want to know is , are we all friends or not ?
- Why , sure we &apos;re friends . - There now , have a drink .
- I will . - God bless you .
Hey ! come on deck !
seamen and firemen fighting , sir .
what &apos;s going on here ?
they were , all of them , having a bit of a harmless fight , sir .
knife wound to the shoulder , sir .
- Who knifed him ? - I don &apos;t know , sir .
it &apos;s only a scratch , hit his head on the deck when he fell .
take him aft . I &apos;ll bandage him up .
look at this , sir .
so that &apos;s the trouble , Driscoll .
take him aft .
- You &apos;ll get no money for this last work .
- But ... I &apos;ll teach you to smuggle rum on a ship and start a riot .
but señor Capitan .
you know the agreement .
rum , no money . we bring no rum . I no lie to you , senor .
these sailors , they bring the rum .
- We bring no rum .
- You &apos;re lying ! clear out ! your boat &apos;s alongside .
none of your lip , or I &apos;ll put you ashore and have you locked up .
hop it .
go on . hop it . come on .
move &apos; em on ! come on , ladies . come on .
mate say we sail at sunrise .
for England .
American port first for cargo , then we go home .
then I go home .
time to turn in , Smitty .
Hello , Captain . how are you ? that &apos;s your ship ?
that &apos;s good . I can just see Ole behind that plow .
Ole be putting a rudder on the horse &apos;s tail and a compass on the plow , so that he &apos;ll not be digging potatoes when it &apos;s turnips he &apos;s after .
Hey , Ole , show us how you used to call them pigs .
if I was a swine , I &apos;d be running the other way after that devilin &apos; screech .
you won &apos;t go home .
you &apos;ll get drunk . the only way you &apos;ll see that farm is through a bottle .
you stop that .
stop what , square-head ?
you don &apos;t make a fool of Ole .
he &apos;s going home . by devil , you &apos;ve got no home .
I got no home . none of us got a home but Ole .
and if you stop him , I fight you .
you go home , Ole .
your mother is old . where &apos;s my hat ?
she needs you . she wants you . you don &apos;t go anymore on sailing .
that &apos;s no good , Ole . that &apos;s no good .
you go home to your mother .
she &apos;s old , and she needs you .
Yeah , I go home .
you go home .
and here are your instructions for the stowage of high explosives .
- High explosives . - Are your cargo holds quite dry ?
Oh , yes .
I &apos;m not worried about keeping the cargo dry , but about getting through the war zone .
we haven &apos;t enough speed to run away from a rowboat .
not even a machine gun to make a fight of it .
if anything hits us below the waterline , we &apos;d go up like a kite .
nevertheless , every ship that gets to England is helping to win the war .
and every officer and man in the merchant marine is doing his bit .
- Unsung heroes ... - Is this when you want us to sail ?
Oh , yes . time is very important , you know .
is it ?
Unsung heroes .
like a curse !
Hey , Yank .
come here .
- Hey . Hey , did you know about this ? - What are you talking about ?
I was wondering what all them blooming uniformed guards were hanging around for .
- That explains it .
- TNT . TNT , it &apos;s high explosives .
it &apos;s the same thing , isn &apos;t it ?
it &apos;s worse . it &apos;s ammunition .
- By jiminy Christmas . - The devil with it .
load up an old hooker like this full of that blooming stuff and what is she ?
just a bomb ! a great , big dynamite bomb !
I quit !
well , we &apos;re all quitting , I &apos;m thinking .
I &apos;m through .
Captain wants you out , men .
everybody out . sir , what &apos;s the meaning of this ?
Captain will answer your questions .
but we didn &apos;t sign on for the kind ...
- Okay , hop it . he &apos;s waiting .
- Well , so are we . all right , let the old man himself explain ...
by devil , I quit !
I ain &apos;t gonna sign on this old tub again .
as far as this job &apos;s concerned , you men haven &apos;t got any names .
you &apos;re just so many hands , just as I am a boss to see this cargo gets to England .
if it doesn &apos;t get there , it &apos;ll be missed , but we won &apos;t .
now I know it &apos;s the usual thing for the fo &apos;c&apos;s &apos;le hands to grouse .
so if anybody &apos;s got any objection to what I &apos;ve said , well , step forward .
well from now on till you &apos;re paid off in London , you get 25 % bonus on your wages .
there &apos;s one thing more .
owing to circumstances over which I &apos;ve got no control , nobody is allowed to leave the ship .
may I ask , sir , why are we deprived of shore leave ?
for your own safety .
I don &apos;t want the cargo talked about ashore .
I think I can be trusted , sir .
when you &apos;re drunk ?
I maintain , sir , that we &apos;re entitled to one night ashore before sailing .
Yeah , I maintain you &apos;ve said enough , Smith .
I &apos;m as interested in the welfare of my ship &apos;s crew as you are .
no more of your lip .
go on .
Roust out , Cocky .
can &apos;t you let a man sleep ?
what about the rest of us ? the old man wants his coffee .
that means he &apos;s going to the bridge . and that means we &apos;re gonna sail .
shake a leg !
can &apos;t let a man sleep .
I &apos;ll expose him .
coffee !
- Well , Captain , goodbye and good luck . - Goodbye , thank you .
are you quite sure you won &apos;t want a pilot ?
no , no pilot .
- Well , bon voyage . - Goodbye .
Goodbye .
all clear !
- He came off the Glencairn . - Let &apos;s take him aboard !
on your feet !
take it away !
one of your men , isn &apos;t he , mate ?
Yes . get aboard , Smith !
get aboard . take it away !
good night , Drisk .
good night , Donkeyman . sweet dreams , too .
full speed ahead , Mister .
alter course .
East by north . half knot .
East by north . half knot .
stop that noise !
you square-headed ape .
he was playing soft , Drisk .
slow her down a few turns .
by golly , I would hate to be on this old tub in rough weather .
Hey , Cocky . hurry up that Scotch .
come on ! let &apos;s shake a leg !
come on , Old Murphy . I &apos;ll help you .
boys , coming ... There you are . now , there you are .
them sea biscuits would break the tooth of a lion if he had the misfortune of biting one .
nothing but scarf upon these rusty ...
Swill , that &apos;s right .
it &apos;s a starvation ship . my last trip !
plenty of work and nothing to eat .
and the owners riding around in carriages .
I think it &apos;s that blasted cook .
fresh meat for the officers and hash for the men . that &apos;s his notion .
hash , hash ! stew , stew !
marmalade , by jiminy !
we hit something ?
it was the anchor .
the anchor &apos;s broke loose !
- Contact ...
Mr. Graves ?
steady kid .
let me ... Let me lie down .
I need to lie down .
excuse me , sir , but the men in the fo &apos;c&apos;s &apos;le are asking if you &apos;ll take another look at the sick man .
is he worse ?
he &apos;s spitting blood again , sir . can you do anything for him , sir ?
well , as far as I can make out , those splintered ribs have punctured his lung .
can you do anything about that , Mister ?
- Why , no , sir .
- No , neither can I , and I don &apos;t think I &apos;m fooling anybody , pretending to be a doctor .
damn ! if it had only happened a week later , we might have made port .
as it is ...
all right , Mister . when you leave , first tell him to come here .
I &apos;ll go forward and see what I can do .
Yes , sir .
a book and a box of physic !
suffering Moses ! it &apos;s colder than kittens up there .
how &apos;s Yank , Drisk ?
- Your wheel , Scotty .
who &apos;s watching lookout ?
me and Drisk .
Oh , it &apos;s nothing but dirty weather this whole voyage .
are you feeling better now , Yank ?
you look better . much better .
am I telling him a lie ?
- Sleep done you good , Yank .
- Sure it has .
in no time at all now , you &apos;ll be having a pint a beer with us in Limehouse .
what are you all lying for ?
you think I &apos;m afraid ?
you think I &apos;m scared ?
don &apos;t you be thinking such thoughts .
don &apos;t be leaving me , Drisk .
- Ole ? - Here , Yank .
don &apos;t leave me .
I &apos;m dying , I tell you .
I won &apos;t stay here alone .
I &apos;ll go out on deck .
there , there , now .
don &apos;t you be worrying , Yank !
I &apos;ll not stir a step out of here , and let that devil of a man curse his black head off .
I take your watch , Ole .
get me some water .
here , here you are , lad .
there you are .
he &apos;s just up and having a fainting spell , sir .
isn &apos;t this your watch , Driscoll ?
Yes , sir , but Yank was fearing to be alone and ...
- Well , that &apos;s all right , Driscoll . - Thank you , sir .
did he take the medicine I sent ?
Yes , sir , but it wouldn &apos;t stay down .
I &apos;m afraid he &apos;s very weak .
please , sir . find some way to help him .
my good man , I &apos;m not a doctor .
you and him been shipmates a long time , haven &apos;t you ?
Yes , sir .
well , keep him quiet , and we &apos;ll hope for the best .
I &apos;ll raid the med room and send some medicine , something to ease the pain anyhow .
you &apos;ll be up tomorrow . we &apos;ll pull you through , all right .
well , keep your courage up . coming , Mister ?
didn &apos;t I tell you ?
sure the Captain will have you on deck chipping rust before the week is out .
don &apos;t lie , Drisk .
I &apos;m gonna die . the sooner , the better .
Oh , by the Holy , you lad . I &apos;ll not let you . I &apos;ll not let you .
give me a drink of water .
my throat &apos;s burning up .
how &apos;s Yank ?
it &apos;s asleep , he is .
no , I ain &apos;t , Drisk .
I was just dreaming .
I thought I was way in the middle of land , where you could never smell the sea or look at a ship .
Prop me up a little , will you ?
so I can breathe .
thanks .
where &apos;s Ole ?
Ole ?
here , Yank .
this ain &apos;t no life , Ole .
if you don &apos;t leave it this trip , you never will .
sure . we &apos;ll both put him on his way home soon as we &apos;re all paid off .
remember the times we &apos;ve had in Buenos Aires ?
- That dance hall in Barracas . remember ? - I do indeed .
Yeah .
and the stink of the hides in La Plata .
give me a puff , Drisk .
remember the night I went crazy with the heat in Singapore ?
and the time we both got locked up for fighting in Sydney . I do indeed .
that fight on the dock in Cape Town .
I can see his face in front of me .
that guy that I ...
let you not be thinking of that now . that &apos;s done and gone and forgot .
it was done in fair fight .
in self-defense , wasn &apos;t it ?
- Wasn &apos;t it , Drisk ?
- Indeed it was .
didn &apos;t he try to stab you in the back and you not suspecting ?
I wish I had no blackened deed on my soul .
where &apos;s all that fog coming from , Drisk ?
fog ?
how &apos;d it get in here ?
of course , lad , it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s just coming in the alleyway .
that &apos;s funny .
I thought I could hear the wind blowing outside .
Yank , lad ,
I never asked you , but have you no relations at all that you could call your own ?
Drisk .
- Drisk ? - Yes , Yank ?
remember that little barmaid in the Red Stork in Cardiff ?
she was a good kid .
swell kid .
lent me dough when I was broke .
buy her something to ...
give me a drink .
Yank ?
Yank , speak to me , lad .
Yank !
Captain sent this medicine for Yank .
he say it would take away his pain where he &apos;s hurting .
Yank &apos;s gone ?
&quot; before the light of God . &quot;
&quot; he that believeth in me , though he were dead , yet shall he live .
&quot; our Lord Jesus Christ , our glorious majesty .
&quot; the seas will give up her dead ... &quot;
thank you , sir .
there &apos;s your coffee , Scotty , if you can call it coffee .
what are you doing ?
I just paint windows , Drisk .
have I no eyes in the front of my head ?
mate &apos;s orders , Drisk .
we show no lights . with the submarines lying about ...
you mean , we &apos;re in the war zone ?
we &apos;ll be tonight . I heard the old man tell the Second .
wouldn &apos;t you think that leg of a Mate would pass the word ?
they ain &apos;t pasting up no bulletins to let the crew know anything .
I don &apos;t like this much .
the lifeboats are ready , ain &apos;t they ?
sure , lower them in a second .
next time I ship on windjammer , Boston to River Plate , loaded with wood only so she float , by golly !
well , I &apos;m ...
Lord !
they &apos;re not half smart , them blighters .
what are you buzzing about ?
it &apos;s written down here in print , or I wouldn &apos;t believe it .
it &apos;s a true confession .
confession of what , man ?
the fifth column .
fifth column ?
it tells here how a German spy in Paris was writing messages to a woman spy in Switzerland , who sent them on to Berlin , Germany .
that &apos;s nothing .
nothing , is it ? wait till you hear how they done it .
to read their messages , you wouldn &apos;t suspect anything , see .
a lot of mush .
the fellows in the War Office that opens them thinks they &apos;re nothing but love letters , you see ?
what do you mean , code ?
what do I mean ? I &apos;ll tell you what I mean .
they have a piece of paper with a lot of little holes cut out in it , and when they put it on top of the letters , they see only the words that tell them what they want to know .
and the Frenchmen get beaten up for it all on account of one letter .
that &apos;s bad .
the conniving , murdering , tricking ... That &apos;s the truth .
here , you can read it for yourself .
no , no , you keep it .
that code , that &apos;s no good , by devil !
come on , Scotty , or the Mate will be down on our necks . your wheel , ain &apos;t it ?
Aye .
shocking ! outrageous ! preposterous !
hash , stew , marmalade , submarines .
Codes , by devil !
East by north . three quarters north .
East by north . three quarter north .
do you smell the land , Smitty ?
Aye , a day and a night now .
don &apos;t let it trouble you , Smitty . crew don &apos;t let on .
but they &apos;re always kind of nervous when they get into the war zone first time .
thanks for the compliment , Donkeyman .
I hope you won &apos;t tell anyone you saw me shaking with fear .
- Oh , I didn &apos;t mean ... - Haven &apos;t you ever needed a drink ?
haven &apos;t you felt every nerve in your body demanding whiskey ?
haven &apos;t you felt like screaming because ...
Oh , what &apos;s the use of talking about it ?
you don &apos;t know what I mean .
indeed , indeed I do .
look , take my advice . don &apos;t leave the ship .
I &apos;m staying onboard . you won &apos;t be alone .
couple of days in port , and then away to sea again .
what &apos;s it going to be , Smitty ?
one big drunk or more memories ?
no , I &apos;m gonna enlist .
good . Navy needs you .
Navy ?
no , I &apos;m going in the army if they &apos;ll have me .
skipper wanted his binoculars . must &apos;ve left them in the chart room .
&quot; international Code of Signals , British Edition . &quot;
why aren &apos;t you up there where you belong ?
I see lights from ship .
right there . first , I think she &apos;s submarine , by golly .
I don &apos;t see nothing .
she wink on . she wink off . then she wink away .
someone is making signals .
no , you &apos;re looney .
no , by devil , I see light .
all right , all right . get up on the topside before the Mate sees you .
keep your eyes peeled .
nearly eight bells , Scotty . rise and shine , Ole .
come on , you guys . shake a leg . get out of there .
- Fog still thick ? - Sure , cut it with a knife .
bloody hate the fog , unless you can hear the foghorn .
well , what do you wanna do , Cocky ? whistle up a few submarines ?
blasted U-boats . I hope the British navy sinks them all .
not only the submarines we have to fear , that &apos;s what I &apos;m thinking .
Oh , you don &apos;t have to worry about mines as far out as this .
I wasn &apos;t thinking of mines either .
your wheel , Ole ?
my lookout .
- Ain &apos;t it your deck watch ? - Yes , yes .
- I can &apos;t figure that guy out . - No , no one has .
watch that light !
sorry , Drisk .
- Do you know what I caught him doing ?
going through the old man &apos;s code books .
Nah ! Smitty , good fellow .
wanna get square-headed ...
wait till you hear what I seen .
Ole , I see light .
she wink on . she wink off . then she wink away .
- Sure , Axel . - Yeah .
hit the bunk !
taking a gander at the chart .
I think the ship &apos;s not safe with the fellow . I think I &apos;ll sleep outside on deck .
I tell you , I see that light . she wink on . she wink off .
and that &apos;s another thing . how did I forget that ?
I thought the square-head was seeing things . maybe he ain &apos;t so dopey after all .
I &apos;m coming along the deck , see , with a coffee pot when ...
curse that fog !
curse him thick !
who &apos;s the lug put his cup where a man &apos;d sit on it .
Smitty .
he think he &apos;s such a fine gentleman that he can &apos;t put his own away the same as the rest of us ?
- He use for get dressed , Smitty , all right ? - All right , is he ?
of course he &apos;s all right !
can &apos;t you keep your tempers ? it &apos;s this blasted fog .
the thought you might be blown to smithereens any minute .
it &apos;s my last trip through the zone , so it is .
devil take them and their 25 % bonus .
be caught like a rat in the trap in the bargain maybe .
- So you think the Duke &apos;s all right ? - Now look here , my boy ...
look , there it is . that &apos;s it .
are you all crazy ?
the light . that &apos;s where it comes from . what &apos;d I tell you ?
Hey ! you &apos;re showing the lights , you lug .
- Who left that open ?
who has done it if Smitty didn &apos;t ? it &apos;s over his bunk , isn &apos;t it ?
she wink on . she wink off . just like wigwag .
Hey , what &apos;s going on here behind my back ?
that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to tell you , Drisk .
maybe you won &apos;t be thinking so much of the Duke when you hear it .
all right , all right .
stop winking and nodding and making a mystery of things .
keep your eye on the door .
- Sing out if you see Smitty coming . - Yeah .
I see him in the chart room , getting a fix on our course .
I caught him in the Captain &apos;s cabin , pouring over the code book , the International Code book .
Easy-peasy .
take it easy , Drisk .
shut up .
by jiminy ! by devil !
are you gonna have it out on deck ?
why should we stay here and be blown to bits ?
are you frightened , you toad ?
well , it &apos;s a fine thing when full grown men shiver like children at the sight of a little black box .
still , it &apos;s a devilish thing , the look of it .
&quot; a bit of a black box , &quot; you call it ?
how big do you think it has to be ? as big as this fo &apos;c&apos;s &apos;le ?
it looks bad , so it does .
there &apos;s only one consolement .
the traitor &apos;s English .
who says he &apos;s English ?
haven &apos;t you read how all them German spies has been living for years in London and talks the King &apos;s English , as good as I do .
he talks English too good . that &apos;s what I mean .
that &apos;s right .
I never met a swell that talked the way he does .
now , listen , Drisk , was he ever open with us like a good shipmate ?
no , he always keeps to himself like he was hiding something .
and the name he calls himself , Smith .
I &apos;ll bet a buck on my next payday that his real name is Schmidt .
Schmidt .
by devil , Schmidt !
devil take me if I don &apos;t think you have the truth of it .
I wish he didn &apos;t come back after he jumped ship in United States .
jumped ship . jumped ship !
he was passing the word to some German bloke about the ammunition we &apos;re carrying .
I &apos;ll lay odds he was trying to sneak in onboard when they nabbed him .
well , I never was afraid of anything or anyone .
- Don &apos;t monkey with it . - Let &apos;s see face to face .
- Now get out of here ! - Careful , Drisk .
- Get that bucket of water . - What are you gonna do with it , Drisk ?
I &apos;ll show you what I &apos;ll do with this Devil &apos;s machinery .
the devil &apos;s got you hot as a clam bake ?
you guys keep out of this . stand back .
- Good work , Drisk . - Now , she don &apos;t blow up , by golly .
- What do you mean &quot; blow up &quot; ? - You pipe down .
now , let &apos;s find this blaggart .
they hang spies on shore , don &apos;t they ?
over the side with him , and one man missing in the morning .
he &apos;ll go over the side , all right , but not till after he &apos;s had a fair trial .
ain &apos;t you seen enough , Drisk ?
if Yank , God rest his soul , was here , he &apos;d agree with me . Johnny .
I found it .
we found it under his bunk . Yeah , under his mattress .
- There &apos;s a bomb in there . - I knew . I knew that fellow .
here , just what &apos;s ...
if this is your idea of a joke ...
we &apos;ll show you how much of a joke it is before we &apos;re through with you .
if you &apos;ll be good enough to explain ...
it &apos;s you who &apos;ll do the explaining , my fine gentleman .
look at it , you dirty swine .
- Look at it !
thought you wasn &apos;t half a fox , didn &apos;t you ?
it &apos;s mine . what are you doing with my things ?
what &apos;s in it ? would you tell us to our faces ?
- That &apos;s my business . - Well , we &apos;re making it our business .
get his keys . see if he has one that &apos;ll open it .
don &apos;t you open that , Driscoll .
if you do , so help me , I &apos;ll kill you if I hang for it .
I am not the one to be killed . I &apos;m no dirty spy .
- Spy ?
- We &apos;re on to your tricks .
hiding this box under your mattress so you could sneak out later and put it in the hall .
what are you talking about , you fool ?
I only put it there so that I could get it quick in case we were torpedoed . you must be insane !
keep your mouth shut !
what are you talking about ? let me get out of this ...
- Wait . - Get back there , you lot !
stand back , you hairy ape !
it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s nothing but a packet of letters .
letters , what did I tell you ?
that &apos;s why he was going through the code book .
letters are worse than bombs sometimes .
where else would spies get their orders from if it wasn &apos;t from letters ?
what orders would he be getting , do you suppose ?
open it and find out .
the name written here is ,
&quot; Thomas Fenwick . &quot;
that &apos;s no more his name than Smith .
Schmidt , that &apos;s this guy &apos;s real tag .
you don &apos;t suppose he &apos;d be using his own name , do you ?
it &apos;s a foreign postmark by the looks of it .
look at the stamp .
B-E-R ...
Berlin ! I knew them letters was from Germany .
Berlin , by devil !
read it , Drisk .
I &apos;m not much of a hand at reading , but it begins , &quot; Tom , darling . &quot;
&quot; Tom , darling &quot; ?
- Read it out louder . - Yeah , out loud .
&quot; Tom , darling ,
&quot; Clive said he &apos;d seen you at Gibraltar
&quot; before you sailed for Malta .
&quot; it wasn &apos;t anything he said , but his manners seemed queer ,
&quot; and I was terribly uneasy
&quot; until your letter arrived .
&quot; there is only one thing , Tom , darling ,
&quot; can wreck our lives ,
&quot; and that is this black shadow . &quot;
- Black shadow ?
- Code word .
sure , go on . go on .
&quot; whenever you &apos;re tempted , dearest man ,
&quot; think of those who love you .
&quot; of Tommy and Betsy
&quot; and of your own Elizabeth . &quot;
- Elizabeth ?
- That &apos;s how it &apos;s signed .
- Queer . - What does it mean then ?
by the Holy , here &apos;s one addressed to this ship .
- Read it . - &quot; S. S. Glencairn . &quot;
that was five months ago in Montevideo .
the writing &apos;s bad in this one .
same hand , only a little shaky .
&quot; Tom , darling ,
&quot; it &apos;s only from your chance meeting with Harry
&quot; that I know where to reach you .
&quot; I know now that you hadn &apos;t stopped
&quot; drinking .
&quot; that you couldn &apos;t stop .
&quot; that you lied about it .
&quot; but I know you lied to give me peace of mind .
&quot; always hoping you could fight it out
&quot; and make it come true .
&quot; my heart broke at the thought of your trial ,
&quot; and I nearly died when your letter finally came
&quot; like a note from the grave
&quot; telling me that , for my own sake ,
&quot; you would never return to England .
&quot; dear , dear man ,
&quot; loss of a commission is not loss of life .
&quot; there is no disgrace we can &apos;t go through together .
&quot; I refuse to tell the children , as you asked ,
&quot; that their father is dead .
&quot; he &apos;ll never be dead to me because I love him .
&quot; Oh , Tom .
&quot; Tom , you must come back to us .
&quot; Elizabeth .
&quot; his Majesty , the King ,
&quot; has been graciously pleased to authorize
&quot; the issue of the ... &quot;
what the devil am I reading that for ?
get the hell out of here , you black lugs !
- Swine ! - By devil !
go on . get yourselves a wink of sleep .
all &apos;s well , Smitty ?
all &apos;s well , Ole .
Ole ?
Axel ?
Yeah ?
do you not smell the land ?
the sweet smell of Ireland .
the fields and the forests , the green hills .
but that &apos;s England that way .
did I ask you ?
make anything of it , Mister ?
they &apos;re flying above the clouds .
I suppose it must be our lads coming in for patrol .
machine guns , bombs , bullets !
hash , you marmalade !
by devil , I quit !
quick ! hide ! quick !
number Two lifeboat .
give me a hand to lower this lifeboat . clear the shocks .
sure , Smitty .
Veer your ship . break your course , man . break your course .
Mrs. Fenwick .
well , Smitty got home .
he &apos;s gone .
gone .
Smitty &apos;s gone .
there you are , the last penny .
put your mark there .
he can write , Mister .
wanna sign up for the next voyage , Olsen ?
no , sir . I go home this time .
- Thank you . - Is that all ?
Aloysius Driscoll .
Aloysius Driscoll .
I know you men will want another berth when you &apos;ve spent your money .
so if anybody wants to sign on for the next voyage before you go ashore , you can do so now .
so speak up .

I &apos;m signing on , sir .

Ole !
come on ! hurry up !
- Come on ! - Come on !
the first thing we do is put Ole on his boat .
- But first , we go to the ticket office . - Ticket office !
ticket office is the word , and I &apos;ll show you the way , and then we &apos;ll go to Joe &apos;s Place .
and after that , we ...
who the devil are you , you little pish-posh ?
Nick is the name , shipmate .
Nick is the name , mates , and I &apos;m glad to meet you one and all .
now this here is a card for Joe &apos;s Place .
lovely dancing girls , bow-wow , no chance of being robbed , and the best drinks in town .
drinks ?
there &apos;ll be no drinks till we put Ole on his boat !
that &apos;s right , Drisk .
you &apos;re making a mistake , shipmates ! best spot in town for a drink .
nice girls to dance with ...
any of you shellbacks looking for a berth ?
what ship is that ?
Amindra .

the Amindra . the Amindra !
a starvation tub , if ever I saw one .
rotten grub , work night and day , and your skull split open if you open your mouth !

the pilot &apos;s aboard , yo-heave-ho !
anchor &apos;s away , and we &apos;ll steer a course for Joe &apos;s Place .
and just to show that my heart &apos;s in the right place ,
I &apos;ll tell you what I &apos;ll do , mates . I &apos;ll stand a drink all round .
drink ! preposterous !
there &apos;ll be no drink till that one &apos;s safe aboard .
that &apos;s the gospel truth .
of course , a glass of beer maybe to wish Ole on his way .
and drink a toast to Smitty .
and Yank .
Smitty and Yank .
Yeah , Yank ...
that &apos;s a grand idea .
you know , mate , when I seen you chaps coming ashore , my heart was touched , thinking of the way our sailor lads is suffering these days .
hearts of oak , I said .
Axel !

by golly , that &apos;s good beer ! you want a drink ?
Ole , good luck to you !
Ole !
one glass of beer .
- The boat ! - The boat !

Yeah , but don &apos;t you ...

going off to war !
is there any place on land or sea where there is no war ?
that &apos;s it . move along . get off the street .
best place to be during a blackout .
blackout . blackout . blackout .
blackout .
everywhere people stumbling in the dark .
is there to be no more light in the world ?
is there no place in this dark land where a man who &apos;s drunk can find a decent bit of fun ?
what have I been telling you all evening , mate ?
don &apos;t let them get your egg out . come on with me to Joe &apos;s Place .
lots of lovely girls and no blooming copper telling you what you can do or what you can &apos;t do .

Oh , yes , and you &apos;re a blushing angel , I suppose .

I &apos;m not a man to be holding hard feelings my first night ashore .
- And me drunk as a log . - Quite right . you &apos;ve got my vote .

- Irish whiskey ! - Same here .

Aye , I &apos;ll treat you a toast , lads !
may the devil burn that black Scot of a Mate .
- Yeah ! I &apos;ll drink to that ! - What will you have , mate ?
he &apos;ll have a pint of beer . and you know who &apos;ll pay for it ? I will .
now , it won &apos;t do you the least bit of harm , mate .
why , you &apos;re the strongest in the whole lot .

- In Norway ? - No .
- Denmark . - No .
- Then it must be Sweden . - Ja .
ain &apos;t that funny ? I was born there , too .
- Where , Miss Freda ? - In Sweden .
- Do you speak Swedish ? - Oh , no .
you see , my old man and woman come here to England when I was only a baby .
I &apos;m an orphan , you know .
and they was speaking English before I was old enough to learn .
so I never knew Swedish . I wished I had .
no place like your home , I says .
Ja .
I leave home when I was kid . now , I don &apos;t leave no more .
I got all the sea I want for my whole life .
what did you do before you was a sailor ?
I work on farm till I &apos;m 16 .
and we lived ... My mother and brother live .
my father is dead .
we live on farm just little way outside Stockholm .
I got plenty money now .
Sewn in pocket . two years &apos; pay .
how clever .
you &apos;ll be getting married , too , I suppose . you got a sweetheart ?
Oh , I don &apos;t know , Miss Freda , I think so . I ...

what &apos;s your hurry ? you haven &apos;t bought me my drink yet .
I only takes a drop of gin now and again .

Right-o .

- Well , I ... - Please .
now , come on . sit down . sit down .
you got a new matey , you know . here , what you gonna have ?
well , then I take a little ginger beer .
- Ginger beer . - Small one .
small ginger beer . you shall have it .
no ! no .
tell me something about your old lady .
your mother , she won &apos;t be half glad to see you , will she ?
does she know you &apos;re coming ?
no , I thought I just give her a surprise .
she must be old , ain &apos;t she ?
you know , Miss Freda , I don &apos;t see my mother in ...
must be 10 years . Oh , I write to her once in a while .
she writes many times . my brother , he writes , too .
my mother say in all her letters , &quot; You come right home ! &quot;
and I write back always , &quot; I come soon . &quot;
and I mean all time to go at end of voyage .
but I come ashore . I take one drink . I take two drinks .
I ship away for another voyage . something always happens .
here we are .
and I took the liberty of having one myself .
Skol .
- Hear her . Skol ! - Skol !
more beer !
well , this time I go home .
I feel homesick for farm and to see my people again .
just like little boy , I feel homesick .
my mother , she gets old .
ship ahoy ! ship ahoy !
- Can I keep the parrot ? - Oh , you ...
what devil &apos;s trick is this ?
what kind of ... Where &apos;s Ole ?
who ?
the big lad , Ole !
Oh , him .
Oh , he left on a steamer . he said he couldn &apos;t wait .
and he told me to say goodbye .
Ole go home .
the big lug made it .
Ole &apos;s gone home to Stockholm .
we still have time to go and say bon voyage . come on .
before you go , how about a farewell drink on the house ?
good idea . good idea . - Come on .
Ole &apos;s gone .
what &apos;ll you have , whiskey ?
Irish whiskey .
that &apos;s a queer thing for Ole to be doing .
if Ole &apos;s gone to the steamer , Drisk , we got time to catch him .
well , we &apos;ve come to see him off anyway .
well , come on now . sling your hooks !
- Shall we go ? - Goodbye , mate !
- Happy trip . - Goodbye !
- Goodbye . Goodbye . - Goodbye .
it &apos;s not in my nature to feel unkindly toward any man , to be holding a grudge inside of me when I might let bygones be bygones .
- Thank you , mate . - So feeling in a merciful mood toward you
- when I might never see you again ... - Now .
... it would be a hard thing to have on me .
of course , it would . of course .
so ...
ship ahoy ! ship ahoy ! ship ahoy !
excuse me , mates , but you haven &apos;t got it quite right . it goes something like this .
- Where &apos;s Ole ?
- Where &apos;s Ole ?
- What did you do to him ? - Where &apos;s Ole ?
Driscoll .
Yes , Driscoll , you ...
- Ole ! - Ole !
come on !
quick !
Ole ! Ole ! Ole !
give me ...
go on . get him off here . quick .
hurry up ! hurry up , there . hurry up !
all clear !
take him forward .
Drisk .

Ole go home .
- Good . - Yeah . Ole go home to Stockholm .
where &apos;s Drisk ? what happened to Driscoll ?
Drisk gone .
- Gone ? gone where ?
- Amindra .
he sail on that devil ship Amindra .
he &apos;s gone .
he &apos;s gone .
gentlemen , Nazi motorized divisions are already massed on our frontiers .
unless a miracle happens , we shall be invaded .
this factory will be one of their first objectives .
I have special instructions here from the minister of the interior .
&apos; &apos; in no circumstances must Herr Bomasch or his G.K. armor plating ... be allowed to pass into Nazi hands . &apos; &apos;
but my work is not yet completed .
the tests that you have made were good enough to show its possibilities .
isn &apos;t that understating it ?
if it &apos;s successful , it will revolutionize defensive warfare .
and it is a revolution that we do not wish to have brought about by the Third Reich .
-Then I am to leave the country .
-As soon as the Nazi invasion starts .
I have here passports for yourself and your daughter .
arrangements have been made for you to carry on your work in another country .
where , you will be told when the time comes .
I have made out lists —
ours ?
no . theirs .
if we resist German protection , Prague will be bombed .
protection . protection from what ?
give me a direct line to the Ministry of the Interior , at once !
what ?
the minister left 10 minutes ago for the Central Radio Station .
the German command has given the order to march .
at this moment , Nazi troops are streaming across our frontiers .
in our present defenseless condition ... resistance is worse than useless .
citizens of Czechoslovakia ...
we must bear the trials that lie ahead ... with fortitude and courage .
be of good heart .
and remember — long live Czechoslovakia !
but will the British government give me facilities ?
everything is arranged . you will be met at Croydon .
here are the details . now , you haven &apos;t a minute to lose .
the plane leaves the airfield in half an hour , and it will be the last .
-But , uh , will you be there ?
-I must stay .
Axel , your daughter .
is that you , Anna ?
you have heard ?
listen , dear . I don &apos;t want to alarm you , but we have to leave the country at once .
go to the airport .
I will be waiting for you .
immediately . do you understand ?
Yes . Yes , at once . where are we going ?
England ?
Yes , of course .
-What &apos;s happening , Miss Anna ?
-Martha , I &apos;ve got to leave at once .
help me put some things in a bag .
Anna Bomasch , you are under arrest .
-we cannot wait any longer !
-Please , another moment !
my daughter was leaving at once .
but the city &apos;s occupied already . we must go !
away ! come on !
Schnell ! Schnell !
Marsch .
Aufschliessen !
Halt !
turn right .
Edward Klein , for laziness .
12 lashes .
my heart will never stand it , Herr Doctor .
-Heart &apos;s fit .
-I have been under treatment for —
take him away . next man .
Karl Marsen , for insubordination .
20 lashes .
good for twice the number by the look of him .
you will soon learn that it &apos;s better to keep your mouth shut ... and to do as you are told .
thank you . I have no wish to become a Nazi .
we shall also teach you that insolence does not pay .
with the aid of those pillars of Nazi culture — the whip and the jackboot .
-Silence !
-I shall say what I like !
you hate the truth ... because , in the end , it will destroy you and your bankrupt philosophy .
you will perish because you have nothing to offer ... because you can &apos;t forever replace tolerance and decency ... with brute force , because you —
stand away from him .
get back to your work .
better leave me .
Mmm ?
Halt !
get along . no talking .
good Samaritan .
I wanted to thank you for yesterday .
the swine !
don &apos;t look at me . we shall be seen .
why did they send you here ?
Oh .
I &apos;m a desperate character .
I had a little school on the Sudeten border .
I was ordered to abolish our language and to teach in German ... by an illiterate Nazi group leader .
so here I am .
Shh .
-And you ?
-My father escaped to England .
I almost went back with him .
-Back ?
-I was at school there .
they arrested me to find out where he was hiding ... and because I couldn &apos;t tell them —
that &apos;s all .
England .
well , good luck to him .
I have been a fool . I —
I should have held my tongue and-and waited .
-we shan &apos;t always be here .
-No ?
somehow , I &apos;m going to join my father .
how ?
-Well , we have friends outside .
-Yes .
but between them and us —
there must be a way .
past searchlights , machine guns , barbed wire ?
I should take any risk if I thought there was a chance .
but there is none .
there isn &apos;t one of us who doesn &apos;t lie awake —
-Keep your mouths shut !
you know the order !
get back , you . I told —
silence .
what is it ?
do you know him ?
he studied with me for a job in the civil bureau .
he might help us .
-But isn &apos;t he a German ?
-Yes .
from the Sudetenland .
when it was occupied by Germany , he was desperate .
I gave him the advice .
become a good Nazi , Paul .
join the party ... and wait .
then you think that —
Yes .
now there may be a chance .
-What &apos;s wrong up there ?
-It &apos;s fused !
it &apos;s all right !
-you should be asleep .
-Karl , what &apos;s that noise ?
-That &apos;s the Goodwin lightship , miss .
-we should be in England in an hour or two .
but it &apos;ll be light then .
you don &apos;t mean we &apos;re going ashore without any passports in broad daylight ?
in broad daylight !
why not ?
come on . only a shilling .
-Aye , aye , knock it . turn it up . what &apos;s the idea ?
-Oh , I &apos;m so sorry .
think you &apos;re the Mauretania ?
I might have had a Lillian Gish on the end of that .
-I &apos;m very sorry indeed .
-All right . granted , me ol &apos; cock .
-Have you caught anything ?
-New eels .
Oh ! that &apos;s a night fish . you &apos;ve been out in a ketch .
not like me — fishing to keep away from the old woman .
-Where do we change ?
-The beach .
-And then London ?
-Yes .
there I shall go to see a friend of my family .
he fled to England last September . he &apos;ll help us .
he &apos;s living at a place called Hampstead . you &apos;ve heard of it ?
Karl , if you only knew how glad I am to be back here ... where people can still laugh and be happy .
come away , Alfie . if you &apos;re not falling in something , you &apos;re dragging in something .
go on .
-Good evening .
-Uh , good evening .
-I should like to see Dr. Fredericks .
-Have you an appointment ?
no , but , uh , if you would give him my name . it is Marsen . Karl Marsen .
-Well , will you come in , please ?
-Thank you .
now , if you will take this to Gilby &apos;s , the opticians .
they &apos;re just around the corner .
if you mention my name , they will make up your little girl &apos;s glasses at a reduced charge .
thank you , Doctor .
and don &apos;t worry . with care , she will grow out of it .
-Thank you , Doctor . good night .
-Good night .
there &apos;s a gentleman to see you , Doctor , a Mr. Marsen .
Marsen ?
Oh , very well . show him in .
-The doctor will see you now .
-Thank you .
good luck .
Mr. Marsen .
-Good evening .
-How do you do , Doctor ?
I was given your name . I &apos;m suffering from an , uh , eyestrain and should like a test .
-Headaches and so forth ?
-Hmm , yes .
if you will be good enough to sit in this chair , please ?
thank you .
-Warm this evening , isn &apos;t it ?
-Rather .
I hear there may be a storm brewing .
now , will you read the top line , please ?
K , M , S ...
Q , R , Y .
and now the line underneath .
m , O , 2 ... 6 , 7 , 3 , G .
I don &apos;t think that is quite right . will you repeat it , please ?
m , O , 2 ... 6 , 7 , 3 , G .
--Heil Hitler .
--Heil Hitler .
well ?
I have to report that on instructions from Gestapo headquarters ...
I successfully made contact with the woman Bomasch ... in Concentration Camp Number Four , Reichsprotektorat of Bohemia .
I escaped with her , as arranged , on the 27th of July ... and came ashore this morning at 11 : 15 , from the freighter Stovendam .
we are staying at an apartment house ... at 124 Paddington Lane , Marylebone .
good . she has , of course , made no attempt to locate her father .
no . I am awaiting your instructions .
this is all we know .
Bomasch is working for the British admiralty . where , we have no idea .
he is certainly well hidden and well guarded .
-Therefore , we must move cautiously .
-Understood , sir .
so do not appear too eager .
impress upon her that you are aliens and must move carefully .
suggest that she places an advertisement to this effect ... in the personal column of the London Times ... signed perhaps with some nickname which her father will know at once .
you will see that that advertisement is repeated daily until it is answered .
when that happens , you will report to me instantly .
-you understand ?
-Yes , sir .
that is all . Heil Hitler .
--Heil Hitler !
I see that fellow Ribbentrop &apos;s going to Moscow .
Hmm . so did Napoleon .
Miss Bomasch , you &apos;re wanted on the phone .
nice time of night to ring up , I must say .
-Who is it ?
-Oh , he didn &apos;t say .
Hello ?
Yes , I &apos;m Anna Bomasch .
in the Times , yes . who is it ?
Yes , I &apos;m alone . who is it , please ?
I can &apos;t answer questions . now please listen carefully .
at the post office in Prairie Street , a letter is waiting for you ... containing a railway ticket .
go to the destination on the ticket , and when you get to the town ... ask for a man named Gus Bennett .
you &apos;ve got the name ?
Gus Bennett .
-Yes , but who do I ask ?
-Everyone there knows Gus Bennett .
you say nothing of this to anyone . that is most important .
Hello ?
-Yes ?
-It &apos;s Anna . may I come in ?
Yes , come in .
Karl , I &apos;ve just heard . somebody telephoned .
-we found him .
-Where ?
-I don &apos;t know yet .
-But , uh , what did he say ?
Karl , I &apos;d love to tell you , but whoever it was said I wasn &apos;t to say a word to anyone .
-Oh .
-I don &apos;t mean you &apos;re just anyone .
-Of course you &apos;re not , but —
-Anna , I —
I would much rather you didn &apos;t tell me .
we don &apos;t know what your father is doing , and it &apos;s probably right you should take precautions .
there &apos;s no one in the world I &apos;d rather confide in .
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;d have done if it hadn &apos;t been for you .
no .
-you are happy now ?
-Mm-hmm .
well , that &apos;s all that matters .
good night , Karl .
- ? ( man singing )
-I &apos;m looking for Mr. Gus Bennett . I was told I &apos;d find him here .
Oh , he &apos;s along here , all right .
you hear a warbling note like an air raid siren ?
well , that &apos;s him singing .
- ? only love can cheer the day ?
-Over there ?
Churns out the same moldy songs from 9 : 00 in the morning .
a human barrel organ , he is .
- ? lots in life may be denied ? - ?
? but hearts can laugh ?
? when love &apos;s inside ?
? for only love can lead the way ?
? as time rolls on and on ?
the song of the century !
when &apos; &apos; Home Sweet Home &apos; &apos; and &apos; &apos; Annie Laurie &apos; &apos; are forgotten , this song will live on .
now , madam , only the price of a stick of rock .
sixpence , sir . the ballad of the age . &apos; &apos; only Love Can Lead the Way . &apos; &apos;
here , buy a copy for the sergeant major . thank you , gentlemen ! thank you !
anyone else want to buy a copy of this haunting melody ?
how would you like to be haunted for a sixpence , miss ?
-Mr . Gus Bennett ?
-In the flesh .
you want me to autograph it ?
I &apos;ll throw that in .
-I &apos;m Anna Bomasch .
-How do you do ?
don &apos;t go away , ladies and gentlemen !
I &apos;m not gonna sing again yet .
-I was told to come and see you , Mr. Bennett .
-Hmm ?
who by ?
-I don &apos;t know .
-Is this a gag ?
well , somebody phoned me . they said you &apos;d have news of my father .
your father ?
never heard of him . somebody &apos;s pulling your leg .
&apos; &apos; only Love Can Lead the Way . &apos; &apos; a tonic so far .
we give the tonic . you provide the &apos; &apos; so far . &apos; &apos;
thank you , madam . Hey , don &apos;t go away . I &apos;m just going to tear off another number .
then we &apos;ll have a talk .
I &apos;m now going to sing the sentimental song hit of the year .
they say the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world ... but , believe me , it &apos;s songs like this that fill it .
? it &apos;s true ?
? Oh , what it does to me to know it &apos;s true ?
? she loves me ?
are you — Are you sure it was Gus Bennett they said ?
-Yes , I &apos;m certain .
-Your father &apos;s not in the song business ?
-No .
-Well , it &apos;s beyond me . how did you lose him ?
-He escaped .
-Escaped ?
you mean he &apos;s still at large ?
-I-I mean , you haven &apos;t seen him since ?
-No .
you see , I was in a concentration camp .
-Were you really ?
where ? -Near Prague .
Prague .
-you here by yourself ?
-Yes .
-Anyone know you &apos;re here ?
-No .
would you like another one of these ?
no , thank you .
Alfie ?
I don &apos;t understand it . it &apos;s extraordinary .
well , it amounts to this .
you don &apos;t know my father ... you don &apos;t know anything about him , and you can &apos;t help me .
is that him ?
father !
Anna !
here it is — Brightbourne , a health resort .
but I hardly think that Herr Bomasch is there for his health .
you notice across the bay is the Dartland naval base .
reports says he &apos;s been there three times in the last week .
probably conducting experiments , sir .
precisely . we can &apos;t afford to delay a moment longer .
there &apos;s another reason for haste .
any day now , Poland may provoke us into invading her in self-defense .
England will not stand by Poland .
we have the personal assurance of Herr Von Ribbentrop as to that .
Hmm . so I understand .
nevertheless , instruct Fredericks that we are putting arrangements in hand at once .
very good , sir .
? you nonchalantly go around ?
? completely unaware ?
it &apos;s just another ordinary day ?
? you meet a sweet who sweeps you off your feet ?
? your heart skips a beat and runs away ?
? you can &apos;t recall a tender thought to show how much you care ?
?
you can &apos;t think of a single thing to say ?
? you &apos;ll meet , so meek You &apos;ll talk , but you don &apos;t speak ?
? your heart skips a beat and runs away ?
? it may be Tuesday or Sunday ?
? Thursday or Monday ?
? love never warns you at all ?
-Is the coffee ready ?
-It won &apos;t be a minute .
-Thank you , dear . - ? ( woman continues , indistinct )
--Oh , hello .
-Hello there .
-Come to see Father ?
no .
-Want some ?
-Thank you .
-Where did you get that from ?
-Post office stopped it .
-Why ?
-I gave them instructions .
what have my private letters to do with you ?
a postmark &apos;s a dangerous thing .
-This letter &apos;s to a friend of mine .
-British ?
-No .
-Refugee ?
I &apos;m not going to be cross-examined .
I must remind you that the government pay me a wage — small but regular — to look after your father .
it &apos;s obviously not small enough .
you don &apos;t suppose I &apos;d write to anybody I couldn &apos;t trust .
why , if it wasn &apos;t for Karl , I wouldn &apos;t be here .
what did you say ?
-He escaped with me .
-But you never told me .
-I told my father .
-But not me .
if I didn &apos;t , it &apos;s simply because Karl is an alien without a passport .
he was afraid he might be deported .
-Known him long ? -No .
what are you doing ?
just want to check up on him .
have you ever heard of an organized escape ?
-Organized ?
-To lead them to your father .
but that &apos;s fantastic . Karl doesn &apos;t even know where I am .
are you sure of that ?
-Of course . I told no one .
-Good .
honestly , I don &apos;t want to throw a monkey wrench into the romance .
thank you . I appreciate that you &apos;re inspired by the highest motives ... and that you &apos;ll go to any lengths to pursue them .
-Any lengths .
-Even to exhibiting yourself in public as a singer .
well , nature endowed me with a gift , and I just accepted it . that &apos;s all .
it &apos;s a pity it didn &apos;t endow you with a voice .
nothing that happened to me in that concentration camp ... was quite as dreadful as listening to you day after day ... singing those appalling songs .
with those few words , you &apos;ve knocked the bottom out of my entire existence .
a pity I only knocked it .
-Mr . Bomasch about ?
-Yes , he is .
admiral Baldwin sends his compliments .
he &apos;d like Mr. Bomasch to have dinner with him this evening .
-And his daughter .
-Hmm . I &apos;ll tell him .
uh , just a minute . didn &apos;t Admiral Baldwin leave for the Mediterranean last Tuesday ?
no . he &apos;s aboard the flagship lying off Dartland .
-But I understood that —
isn &apos;t he going too far out for Dartland ?
sorry to barge in . I say , Charles , the wife &apos;s just phoned .
-I understand you &apos;re coming over to tea on Sunday .
-Yes , so I believe .
well , she wants you to remind Beryl to bring some recipe book — pickling walnuts or something .
-Oh , yes . will do .
-Right .
-Oh , hello , Randall . how are you ?
-Hello . Hi .
we were just discussing the Bomasch affair .
Oh , yes , you slipped up rather badly there , didn &apos;t you ?
-Yes , I —
-Well , it wasn &apos;t exactly his fault .
we ought to have known about Karl Marsen .
the War Office has been stinking about him .
they take the view that this armor plating of Bomasch &apos;s ... will make all the difference in the next war .
probably nothing of the sort , but , well , there you are .
and by tonight , Bomasch will be in Berlin ... where they won &apos;t lose any time before putting the screws on the poor devil .
tomorrow night ?
that means he won &apos;t be at the admiralty until , let &apos;s see — Saturday morning .
that &apos;s about it . why ?
Twenty-four , maybe 48 hours .
why ?
what are you driving at ?
well , they got him out of England . why shouldn &apos;t I get him back ?
but that &apos;s quite impossible .
why ? I know my way about .
I was three years in Berlin .
-Drinking lager .
-Mmm . vodka now , isn &apos;t it ?
what about the Polish situation ?
Germany may march at any moment . you know what that means .
I shall be back before then . well , sir ?
well , you know perfectly well I can &apos;t give you permission to do it .
and the fact that you make the request at all shows you &apos;re not yourself .
-Don &apos;t you think so , Gaskin ?
-Oh , well , I —
I quite agree with you .
now , I suggest you take a week &apos;s sick leave ... to enable you to get a complete change of air , hmm ?
thank you , sir . I understand . I think it might be very good for both of us .
Mm-hmm . now , I expect you &apos;d like to have a little chat about it .
Yes , I would , sir .
Oh , well , uh , Charles , you won &apos;t forget about that recipe , will you ?
no , no . I &apos;ll remember .
now look here .
I don &apos;t know what your plans are ... but I expect you &apos;ll want a few letters of introduction .
Mm-hmm .
Reichssender K ?
nigs Wusterhausen calling .
early this morning , the Polish hoards attacked Germany .
the führer immediately gave orders to our glorious army to invade Poland ... and to destroy these intolerable aggressors ... of peace-loving Germany .
Naval High Command , Herr Major .
-How can I reach you ?
-I &apos;ll ring you tonight .
I &apos;ll be waiting . good luck .
all identity cards .
all identity cards .
all identity cards to be shown .
all identity cards .
all identity cards to be shown .
identity card ?
come on , come on , come on .
I &apos;ve worked here for 10 years . you Gestapo fellows must want a job .
-All right , all right .
-This is a fine country to live in .
-Hey . what &apos;s that ?
-Nothing .
-Name . department .
-Schwab . records . intelligence .
-Report that man .
-Excellent , Officer .
while we have men like you at home , we have nothing to fear . nothing .
Oh , I have an appointment with Commander Kampfeldt .
-Where can I find him ?
-Second floor , sir .
thank you .
this is a very grave matter , very grave .
it has just been reported to me that you &apos;ve been heard expressing sentiments ... hostile to the fatherland .
-What , me , sir ?
-What is it ?
Major Herzoff to see you . he asked me to give you this .
can &apos;t you see I &apos;m engaged ?
I warn you , Schwab , such treasonable conduct will lead you to a concentration camp .
but , sir , what did I say ?
you were distinctly heard to remark , &apos; &apos; This is a fine country to live in . &apos; &apos;
Oh , no , sir . there &apos;s some mistake .
no , what I said was , &apos; &apos; This is a fine country to live in . &apos; &apos;
huh ?
-you sure ?
-Yes , sir .
Hmm . I see .
well , in future , don &apos;t make remarks that can be taken two ways .
-Much wiser not to talk politics at all .
-Yes , sir .
-you may go .
-Heil Hitler .
Heil Hitler .
this is a fine country to live in .
this is a fine country to live in .
this is a bloody awful country to live in .
shall I show Major Herzoff in , sir ?
-Uh , yes , yes .
-Yes , sir .
please .
Major Herzoff .
-Heil Hitler .
-Heil Hitler .
-Sit down , Major .
-Thank you .
sorry to keep you waiting .
&apos; &apos; this is to introduce to you Major Ulrich Herzoff ... of the Corps of Engineers .
Major Herzoff is in Berlin on an important technical mission ... for which he requires admiralty assistance .
I am sure , my dear Kampfeldt , that you will give him your best cooperation .
Heil Hitler . &apos; &apos; et cetera , et cetera , et cetera .
I wish these War Office fellows would learn to write properly .
signature might be anything .
whose is it ?
well , I have no idea .
as usual , I was taken from one office to another .
-I suppose it couldn &apos;t be Sardvitz .
-Sardvitz ?
or did he go in the purge ?
-I can &apos;t remember .
-I believe he did .
Hmm . whoever he was , he spoke very highly of you .
he did ?
might be Meidvidtz .
not very likely though .
however , the important thing is , what can I do for you ?
I want to refer to certain technical evidence ... given before the Naval Heavy Armaments 1935 Committee .
if you will let me have a report of the copy , Commander .
certainly . it will take only a moment . I have my own filing system here .
a copy of the Naval Heavy Armaments 1935 Committee &apos;s report .
-Have you been in Berlin long , Major ?
-No .
I only left the Siegfried line last Tuesday .
really ?
how is it there ?
things are pretty hectic , I expect .
Pumping night and day .
I was there in a consultative capacity .
steel fortifications . you possibly have heard .
Oh , yes , yes . Major Herzoff , of course .
looks rather like Stuckner .
but I believe he is doing diplomatic work in the Balkans .
-And who is not ?
I &apos;m afraid we haven &apos;t a copy of the 1935 report , sir .
-What &apos;s that ?
-we have one of &apos; 34 , but not &apos; 35 .
are you sure there was a &apos; 35 committee ?
I sat in it myself as army liaison officer .
I beg your pardon . very well , very well .
it &apos;s these fellows at the top . they forget to send copies on .
perhaps the construction department might be able to help .
the very thing .
they might have one . I &apos;ll ring them at once .
-Oh , I &apos;m sorry —
-No trouble at all .
Commander Prada .
I have with me Major Ulrich Herzoff of the Corps of Engineers .
he is well known for his splendid technical achievements on our west wall ... as you &apos;re no doubt aware .
he will be greatly obliged if you can give him some assistance .
you &apos;ll see him at once ?
thank you , sir .
1935 , you said . I guess I could get hold of a copy for you .
now , Commander Prada , you may be able to help me more directly .
-you know , I just left the Siegfried line .
-Mm-hmm .
so Kampfeldt said .
how is everything ?
the Krupp &apos;s armor plating is the trouble .
confidentially , that &apos;s why I am in Berlin .
do you realize that the steel used by the Czechs is better than anything we have got ?
Mm-hmm .
so I &apos;ve heard .
but surely , now that we control the Harska works —
not enough .
we let the only man who counted there slip through our fingers .
-Bomasch .
-Yes .
I knew Axel Bomasch personally .
I was present at the first gunnery test of his G.K. plating .
where is he ?
working for Britain .
but if we can &apos;t trace this 1935 report —
one moment , Major .
you will be surprised to hear that Bomasch is no longer in England .
what ?
he was brought back to Germany only a few hours ago .
in fact , he &apos;s in this building now .
but this completely alters my plans .
perhaps you can arrange for me to see Herr Bomasch at once .
I &apos;m afraid it &apos;s impossible . he &apos;s with the controller .
surely there &apos;s no harm in my asking him a few questions .
it &apos;s beyond my province , Major .
I &apos;ll pass you on to Captain Viengarten , but frankly I don &apos;t think it will get you any further .
the controller &apos;s office is rather like the kingdom of heaven ... and , if anything , a little more exclusive .
but you are no longer living in a decadent democracy ... ruled by a pack of raving intellectuals !
this is the Third Reich , and the führer does not tolerate ... stupid , insolent obstinacy !
you have been asked to work for Germany , Herr Bomasch , and you will .
can &apos;t you leave him alone ?
you &apos;ve bullied and shouted at him ever since we got here !
-He &apos;s had no sleep !
-He must agree !
can I have another word with him , sir ?
as you please .
Anna .
it &apos;s useless for your father to resist like this .
you must persuade him . you will both be given reasonable freedom .
freedom here ?
in time , you will see things the way I do ... the way everyone in Germany does .
I &apos;m not a German .
Germany is as much your country as it is ours now .
we don &apos;t hate the Czechs . we only wish to protect them .
as you &apos;re protecting the people of Poland ?
you have been too long in Britain , listening to their smug hypocrisy !
if I listened to hypocrisy in Britain , it was not from the British .
I was doing my duty ... as a citizen of the Reich and a subject of the führer ... for whose sacred mission no sacrifice is too great .
that sounds rather like something you learnt from a book .
for years , you &apos;ve had this sort of thing drilled into you until it &apos;s all you know or care about !
you &apos;re a fanatic with a set of stupid , fixed ideas !
if you hadn &apos;t made me hate you more than I thought I could possibly hate anybody ...
I think I should feel sorry for you .
you have expressed yourself very clearly , Fraulein Bomasch .
you will be placed in a concentration camp until your father comes to his senses .
-Must you drag my daughter into this ?
-It rests with you , Herr Bomasch .
Hello ?
what , here ?
very good .
admiral Hassinger is on his way up .
the Chief of Naval Staff , Vice Admiral Count Hassinger .
come in , my dear fellow .
come in .
Strasse , let me present Major Herzoff of the Corps of Engineers .
I expect you have heard of him .
the man behind the Siegfried line , eh , Herzoff ?
only one of the men , sir .
the führer is responsible for the line as he is responsible for everything .
well , what progress ?
you remember me , Herr Bomasch . I did not expect to see you again here .
and you , Fraulein Bomasch . I see you have not forgotten .
it must be ... four years .
Major Herzoff is preparing a highly confidential report on armor plating .
he has been on several missions to Prague .
-He met Bomasch there .
-Just one moment , sir .
Marsen , conduct Herr Bomasch and his daughter into the next room .
-Mr . Bomasch .
-Maybe we shall meet again , later .
I thought it unwise to speak in front of Bomasch .
so far , we &apos;ve made no impression on him .
I do not agree .
he looks 10 years older .
my orders are to obtain quick results .
at the Reich , we are rather inclined to believe ... that the knuckle-duster is the best diplomatic weapon .
do I understand that you question ?
I question nothing . I am an army officer .
personally , I do not follow any of this at all .
Bomasch is not the man to be bullied into cooperation , sir .
well , what do you suggest ?
I knew Fraulein Bomasch in Prague .
she has a great influence with her father and is the one person who can make him change his mind .
Oh , Marsen here has tried that , but she refused to listen .
he is largely responsible for tracing Bomasch in England ... completely outwitting the British military intelligence .
so , may I express a soldier &apos;s admiration ... for one who can carry out his mission under the very eyes of the enemy secret service ?
thank you , sir .
but if I may say so , I hardly think the captain ... is a suitable person to influence the lady .
and who do you think would be more suitable ?
why , uh , myself , for instance .
-you ?
-Why not ?
Herzoff was very friendly with her in Prague , you know .
a little more than friendly .
you saw the way she looked at me when I came in .
Oh , yes , of course . seems to me you are a bit of a dog , Herzoff .
a technician , Admiral .
one does not talk about these things ... but I think if I were to spend a few hours alone with her ...
I might induce her to reason with her father .
Oh . what do you think about that , Strasse ?
I cannot promise , mind you .
four years is a long time .
it seems to me it is worth attempting .
after all , the business is urgent , Strasse .
it is indeed , sir .
you really believe that you could influence a girl in a matter of hours ?
-Shall we say overnight ?
-I see .
knowing Fraulein Bomasch , sir , I doubt whether even his qualities ... will make any impression on her .
-you aren &apos;t acquainted with my qualities .
-Strasse , we &apos;ll let him try it .
no harm done if he doesn &apos;t succeed . leave all the arrangements to me .
this requires a knowledge of maneuvers . come along , Herzoff .
you may be right , my dear . Bennett may be trying to help us .
but why have they brought us to this hotel , provided you with clothes ?
it doesn &apos;t make sense to me .
well , Bennett &apos;s behind it , obviously . he &apos;s organized the whole thing .
how ?
well , how did he manage to get into the German admiralty as a Nazi officer ?
but I don &apos;t see how he can get us away from here , Anna .
Oh , Father , don &apos;t worry about it . perhaps you &apos;d better go to bed now , eh ?
we &apos;ll find out what it &apos;s all about in the morning .
-Good night .
-Good night .
good night , my dear .
come in .
-Fraulein Bomasch ?
-Yes .
thank you .
-you are expecting me .
Major Herzoff .
-Yes , sir .
good evening .
your room is Number 18 . your bags have been taken up .
-My flowers arrive ?
-Yes , sir .
the lady has them .
-Thank you .
good night .
-Good night , sir .
my darling , you look as charming as ever .
those same sweet lips , like warm carnations .
those sweet , mysterious eyes , darker and softer ... than the bluest dusk of August violets .
as the poet has it , and I hope he was Aryan .
no one under the bed , I trust .
uh , bring me a bottle of Krug &apos; 28 .
-That will be excellent .
-What &apos;s happening ?
you may have gathered that we were partners in a highly romantic interlude in Prague four years ago .
-By the way , did you like the flowers ?
-Does that matter ?
-It cost me 12 coupons .
-Well , go on .
well , tomorrow morning I &apos;m going to phone the admiral ... and say that your father is now prepared to work for Germany .
-What ?
-I shall say that I persuaded you to reason with him .
they &apos;re bound to ask me to take you both along .
the Gestapo man downstairs will let us pass and then —
-Yes , but how do you know he will ?
-They listen in to the phone .
they always do .
then instead of driving to the admiralty , we shall go to a meadow outside Berlin ... where a plane is waiting .
I see .
but why should the admiralty believe you &apos;ve persuaded me ?
I shall indicate that , uh , once again you have succumbed to my charms .
once again ?
it happened in Prague , I &apos;m afraid .
and you told them a fantastic story like that ?
well , it was four years ago , there was a harvest moon ... and I was younger and more dashing then .
but you really mean all this ?
it sounds far too simple .
I have a very simple mind .
but there is one small complication .
I shall have to spend the night here — in a purely professional spirit , of course .
-That is necessary ?
-Well , sort of fits into the picture .
the place is absolutely crawling with Gestapo .
-Have you any sporting instinct ?
well , I &apos;ll , uh , toss you who sleeps on the couch .
but you &apos;re treating all this as if it were some sort of joke .
-you don &apos;t seem to realize how much depends upon it .
-It &apos;s no good being intense about it .
-you don &apos;t think I like the idea of a firing squad , do you ?
England may be at war with Germany tomorrow .
Oh , I see . but don &apos;t you think I ought to tell my father about all this ?
-No .
-Why not ?
it &apos;d hardly look right for a lovesick girl to go popping back to her dad .
that &apos;ll be the waiter . if you can pretend you find me unbearably attractive , so much the better .
-All right . I &apos;ll try .
-Thank you .
my little Anna .
-Is it , uh , raining ?
-No , miss .
is anything the matter ?
that tune you were whistling , sir — it is an English tune , isn &apos;t it ?
-How do you know ?
-I heard it on the radio from London last night .
are you not aware that listening to the foreign broadcasts is forbidden ?
-That there is a strict penalty ?
-Oh , I &apos;m sorry , sir .
I will not report you on this occasion , but see that you are more discreet in future .
get out .
-- ( sighs ) Very awkward .
lucky it wasn &apos;t &apos; &apos; Rule , Britannia ! &apos; &apos;
I handled it rather neatly , I thought .
if a woman ever loved you like you love yourself , it would be one of the romances of history .
as I &apos;m unlikely to think of an adequate reply to that , I think we ought to drink a toast .
England expects that every secret service man this night shall do his duty .
--Flat .
-They &apos;re ringing your room .
-I &apos;ll take it here . it looks better .
-Hello ? is that call for me ?
it &apos;s German Admiralty .
Yes . Herzoff here . Yes , sir .
I &apos;m sorry to disturb you at this hour , Herzoff , but we have to alter our plans .
we have just received instructions from headquarters in Munich ... that Bomasch is to go there at once by the first train .
but this is ridiculous , sir . couldn &apos;t you delay it for a few hours ?
impossible . it is on the führer &apos;s orders . the train leaves in an hour &apos;s time .
but , sir , what is the use of sending Herr Bomasch to headquarters in his present frame of mind ?
what do you suppose the führer &apos;s frame of mind would be if we didn &apos;t ?
I &apos;m sorry , Herzoff .
-What &apos;s happening ?
-They &apos;re sending you to Munich at once .
-There &apos;s only one chance .
-What ?
-Leave the hotel , scuttle — an old German custom .
-But the guards downstairs .
we got into the admiralty . we &apos;ll get out of here .
get your clothes on . tell your father we leave here in five minutes .
I &apos;ve been instructed to leave immediately with Herr Bomasch .
I shall not require you . dismissed .
-Shall I get you a taxi , sir ?
-I &apos;ll call one myself .
- - Good morning , sir .
- Good morning .
I &apos;m here to escort Herr Bomasch and Fraulein Bomasch to Munich .
the controller phoned me 10 minutes ago .
I was about to drive them to the admiralty myself .
my orders are to take them straight to the station .
the train leaves in 50 minutes .
evidently a misunderstanding on my part .
-Very well . we are ready .
-you , sir ?
certainly . were you not told ?
I have the admiral &apos;s authority to travel with them .
he feels it essential that Herr Bomasch should be persuaded to comply with our wishes ... before he reaches headquarters .
I was progressing extremely well with Fraulein Bomasch when this happened .
I see . very good , sir .
-Zigaretten !
Zigarren !
-There &apos;s not a copy of this week &apos;s Punch ?
-Please ?
punch . English magazine .
very humorous . you must have a copy .
no .
she hasn &apos;t got a Punch , old man .
-Hasn &apos;t she ?
-No .
well . sold out , I suppose .
you will all leave here and find places elsewhere .
this compartment is commandeered by the police . come along . no delay , please .
they &apos;ve got La Vie Parisienne , old boy .
la Vie Parisienne ? all right .
don &apos;t bother about a Punch .
Oh .
everyone &apos;s hopped it .
must have got in the wrong train , I expect .
--We can have a side each to ourselves now .
-Put our feet up .
-There .
bought a copy of Mein Kampf .
occurred to me it might shed a spot of light on all this how-do-you-do .
-Ever read it ?
-Never had the time .
I understand they give a copy to all the bridal couples over here .
Oh , I don &apos;t think it &apos;s that sort of book , old man .
this is the compart — Why are you still here ?
-What ?
-you must find other places at once .
we have first-class tickets , you know .
outside , please . this compartment has been commandeered by the authorities .
-That is beside the point .
-Yes . we are British subjects .
Yes . look here .
&apos; &apos; we , Edward Frederick Lindley , Viscount Halifax ...
his Majesty &apos;s Principal Secretary of State &apos; &apos; et cetera ... &apos; &apos; request all whom it may concern ... to allow the bearer to pass without let or hindrance ... and to afford him or her &apos; &apos; —
outside !
-Hmm .
-No good arguing , I suppose .
-Apparently not .
waste of time , all this bilge in the passport .
come , please .
-It &apos;s hopeless . we &apos;ll never get away now .
-we &apos;ll think of something .
-Outside . come along . hurry !
-All right . all right .
Hel —
excuse me .
now , don &apos;t forget that you &apos;re terribly attracted to me .
the two guards &apos; compartment is in there , sir .
all right . thank you .
-Would you like to face the engine ?
-Whatever you like .
did you notice that German officer who came into our compartment ?
Yes . why ?
well , I could &apos;ve sworn it was old Dicky Randall .
Dicky Randall ?
--Yes . we were at Balliol together .
you must have heard me talking about him . he used to bowl slow leg breaks .
played for the Gentlemen once .
caught and bowled for a duck , I remember .
Oh , yes . Dicky Randall .
well , if he &apos;s a German officer , how can he be Dicky Randall ?
well , I knew him quite well . his rooms were next to mine .
why on earth —
you don &apos;t think he &apos;s working for the Nazis like that fellow what &apos;s-his-name ?
traitor ?
hardly , old man .
he played for the Gentlemen .
only once .
I was looking in a shop window in the Graben ... and I saw the reflection of a girl .
for a moment , I thought it was you .
-Were you by yourself ?
-Yes . why ?
I just wondered .
it &apos;s a blackout .
you know what that means so far west as this .
England and France have declared war .
we have nothing to fear . the nation is behind the führer .
Yes , but how far behind ?
we &apos;re stopping .
everybody out at once , please !
everybody out on the platform .
everybody out of the compartment , please . everybody out at once , please .
-Why are we stopping ?
-I don &apos;t know yet , sir . just had the order .
everybody out , please . everybody out . everybody out .
-How far are we from Munich ?
-About an hour &apos;s journey .
all passengers off the train , please .
all passengers off the train .
all passengers off the train , please .
-What &apos;s happening ?
-Everybody —
Heil Hitler ! this train is required for troops .
there will be only a small amount of room available for passengers .
-My party must have the same accommodations .
-Oh , yes .
the train leaves again in 20 minutes .
may I have your carriage number , please , sir ?
-Yes . it &apos;s , uh , 0735 .
-0735 .
Oh , I beg your pardon . aren &apos;t you old Dicky Randall ?
Major Herzoff , Corps of Engineers .
Oh , I &apos;m frightfully sorry .
it was very silly of me , but it &apos;s an amazing likeness .
Yes , you &apos;d better come along , old man .
extraordinary . English , I presume .
-Apparently .
-They &apos;re a very peculiar race .
we have a small waiting room , sir . perhaps you would prefer to wait in there .
-Thank you .
-This way , please .
please . please , this way .
everybody off the train now , please !
everybody off the train !
you know , you — you made me feel painfully embarrassed , Caldicott .
well , I can &apos;t help it if old Dicky Randall has a double .
you must realize that we &apos;re traveling in very difficult times .
--What &apos;s the matter ?
I can &apos;t help thinking of your face when he said , &apos; &apos; Major Herzoff , Corps of Engineers . &apos; &apos;
well , all I can say , Charters , is that when it comes to humor ... we live in entirely different worlds .
this waiting room is required .
every passenger must wait outside . come on .
und you too , please . come on . so quick like possible .
-This is getting beyond a joke . -Yes .
we can &apos;t stand for this .
come on , please . out .
everybody out so quick as possible . everybody must wait outside .
all passengers must wait outside . please go .
no good being undignified , old man .
no , quite right .
come on . please , please , please , please . come on .
come on . so . please .
Oh , Major . may I phone Munich to notify them of our delay ?
of course .
my absence may provide the opportunity for Fraulein Bomasch to approach her father .
it might help .
you seem to have made a considerable impression on the lady , Major .
I apologize for doubting your capabilities .
stay on guard here . see that no one enters or leaves .
understand ? no one .
-That man who spoke to you , did you know him ? -Yes , I did .
a fellow called Caldicott .
it &apos;s probably the first time he &apos;s ever left England before the end of the cricket season .
-Just my luck . he gave me a very nasty moment .
-No one would have guessed it .
I was a member of the Foreign Office operatic society .
do you know I once played Pooh-Bah to the Foreign Secretary &apos;s Ko-Ko ?
-Have you thought of any way of getting us out of this ?
-I have .
a car will be waiting at Munich to take us to headquarters .
we &apos;ll be quite a crowd , and I shall ask for a second car so that we can be alone .
-Suppose they don &apos;t give it to us .
-They will .
because by that time , we shall be on the verge of persuading your father to work for Germany .
you , on the other hand , must be asking for time to think .
-you get the idea ?
-Yes , but —
then we only have the chauffeur to deal with . and after that — Switzerland .
-Switzerland ?
-Well , we can hardly break through the Siegfried line .
Yes , but Switzerland &apos;s a long way from Munich .
if we can bluff them into giving us that car , we &apos;ll make it .
so from now on , Mr. Bomasch , you &apos;ve got to make up your mind ... whether to keep your armor plating or let it go rusty .
-Is that quite clear ?
-I think so .
and you &apos;re still so crazy about me that you would sell the armor plating for a very small lock of my hair .
all right .
you can &apos;t sit here !
-Why not ?
-This truck is required .
come on . off , off , off , off , off , off .
I suppose these bags aren &apos;t required too ?
off , off , off , off , off , off , off .
pushed about from pillar to post by this railway ever since we got on the train .
-Everything we sit on seems to be required .
-It &apos;s monstrous .
-we shall write to the company about this .
-Hmm !
you &apos;re not at war with England yet , you know .
but you are mistaken .
France declared war this afternoon .
und England declared war this morning . so !
Achtung !
war .
Yes .
-Good heavens .
-What &apos;s the matter ?
my golf clubs .
where are they ?
I lent them to Max in Berlin .
like a fool , I said he needn &apos;t bring them back till next Wednesday .
probably seen the last of them .
Yes . I expect they &apos;ll require them for something or other .
I read in the paper that they &apos;re pulling up park railings .
I don &apos;t see the connection , old man .
well , your clubs are steel , aren &apos;t they ?
-Yes .
-So .
there you are then .
whip shafts too .
especially made for me .
why not get in touch with Max ?
-How ?
-On the telephone .
ask him to send them to London immediately .
it &apos;s a desperate chance , but it &apos;s worth taking .
I shall never be able to replace them .
-Oh , uh , telephone ?
-Hmm ?
stationmaster &apos;s office .
Captain Strasse ?
Marsen here .
-I &apos;m speaking from Kurtbaden .
-Oh , I beg your pardon .
it concerns Major Herzoff , sir .
I think a full inquiry should be made at once ... in view of something which happened a few minutes ago .
a few minutes ago ?
you mean he &apos;s with you ?
admiral Hassinger gave him the authority .
Hassinger did ?
he never told me .
that &apos;s very suspicious .
Yes , but the admiral himself introduced him .
I &apos;ll ask him . I &apos;ll phone you back .
uh , what is your number there ?
Yes , yes , yes . in a few minutes .
admiral Hassinger , please .
Hello ? I want a long-distance call to Berlin .
Oliver 2-4-double 6 .
what ? Yes .
Yes , of course it &apos;s important .
-It &apos;s all in German .
-Hmm .
what ?
well , how long then ? Oh , all right .
blasted junction &apos;s engaged by the military . they &apos;ll call me back .
these people seem to have no idea of business as usual .
if I were asked to give a snap judgment , I should say that was an &apos; &apos; S. &apos; &apos;
-More like an &apos; &apos; F. &apos; &apos;
-I do not know , sir .
I used to know someone who made his S &apos;s like that .
-Someone in the War Office ?
-Well , no .
Ach . we can &apos;t afford to waste time .
you didn &apos;t give him permission to travel with the prisoners , did you , sir ?
no , no . but he may have assumed it .
if you remember , we more or less gave him carte Blanche .
the only thing is to check up with the War Office , sir .
-I suppose so .
-War Office .
if he &apos;s right , this will be very serious for you , Kampfeldt .
very serious indeed .
the letter was addressed to you . there &apos;s no denying that , Kampfeldt .
quite right . I &apos;m afraid I shall have to sack my secretary .
Hello ?
--That &apos;ll be our call .
Aufschliessen !
Hmm !
what infernal impudence .
I &apos;ll bet it &apos;s my call .
Marsen speaking . Yes , sir .
listen , Marsen . you were right . we have been completely fooled .
Herzoff is not known at the War Office .
there is no officer of that name on the army list .
then , uh —
Yes , sir . obviously . an enemy agent .
I say , Charters , there &apos;s another phone in there .
what ?
Oh . lucky .
--Hello ?
Hello ?
Hello !
-Gone dead .
-Hello !
-Why not try the thingamy ? Yeah .
-you know , the ... gadget .
-Oh .
Hello —
it &apos;s the extension . that chap out there .
well , perhaps he &apos;ll be off the line in a minute .
-Shh !
-What &apos;s up ?
they &apos;re talking about what &apos;s-his-name .
you know , Herzoff .
no . he doesn &apos;t suspect .
Yes , sir . I see .
all passengers aboard , please !
no time to stand here now , sir . the train is leaving .
what ?
listen , we can &apos;t afford to take risks .
carry on with Herzoff to Munich .
let him think he &apos;s getting away with it . understand ?
I &apos;ll get on to army headquarters there .
very good , sir .
all passengers aboard , please !
-Everybody on the train !
-What is it ?
well , as far as I can make out , Herzoff isn &apos;t Herzoff .
-What ?
-No .
they &apos;re sending an escort to arrest him — when we get to Munich .
-Herzoff ?
-Yes .
well — Then —
-Listen , if — if Herzoff isn &apos;t Herzoff —
-What ?
-Well , he must be Dicky Randall .
-Yes .
everybody on the train !
all passengers aboard , please !
all passengers on the last two coaches only !
all passengers aboard !
-All passengers aboard .
-After you , Major .
all passengers on the last two coaches only .
all passengers on the last two coaches .
all passengers aboard .
all passengers on the last two coaches only .
all passengers on the last two coaches .
all passengers aboard .
keep within call . I shall need you at Munich , perhaps before .
-One thing emerges very clearly from all this .
-Caldicott !
-The train ! there it goes !
Oh , my , my ! that &apos;s a mess !
-That was a near thing .
I thought we were going to be in this infernal country for the duration .
Oh , my Lord .
don &apos;t anticipate , old man .
what were you saying just now about something emerging very clearly ?
-I said ?
-Mmm .
-When ?
-On the platform .
-About something emerging ?
-Mmm .
what was it ?
-What was what ?
-What emerged .
-you never said .
-Oh .
we do not wish to persuade you to become a National Socialist , Herr Bomasch .
I explained that to your daughter . have I not ?
and you may work wherever you choose , Father .
-Isn &apos;t that so ?
-Quite .
-After all , we should have our freedom .
-I know , my dear .
but freedom is strangely interpreted in this country .
I do not agree with you , Herr Bomasch .
freedom in Germany is a great advance on freedom elsewhere .
it &apos;s properly organized and controlled by the state .
I &apos;d much rather we kept politics out of it .
Herr Bomasch unfortunately refuses to understand ... the sacred importance of the Nazi world mission .
-His stay in England perhaps .
-No doubt . a corrupt influence .
a corrupt country .
controlled by international Freemasons and the Jew Churchill .
but since you wish it , Herr Bomasch , we will drop politics ... and discuss it from a more personal basis .
I &apos;m certain , Charters , that what you were about to say ... was that we &apos;ve stumbled on something pretty serious .
there &apos;s no doubt which side Randall &apos;s playing for .
-Ours ?
-Yes .
Yes . that &apos;s what was emerging so clearly .
it &apos;s up to us to find some way of warning him .
Yes . come on . let &apos;s find him .
-I say , Caldicott .
-Yes ?
-Do you think we &apos;re wise rushing into this ?
-How do you mean ?
well , I mean we &apos;ve no proof that Randall &apos;s working for England .
-Well , everything points to it .
-Yes , but is that enough ?
we &apos;re enemy aliens ... and these Nazis are pretty free with their firing party .
Hmm . well , ought we to let that stand in our way ?
well , certainly not .
I mean if — if we were certain .
as it is , we &apos;ve just got to bear it in mind .
I don &apos;t see what else he can be doing .
for all we know , he may be an international crook .
crooks don &apos;t generally play for the Gentlemen .
Raffles did .
that &apos;s fiction .
still , you may be right , Charters .
of course , if we were certain , we &apos;d do our duty and take the risk .
Yes , of course .
as it is , I can get on with Mein Kampf .
haven &apos;t got out of Hitler &apos;s boyhood yet .
and , Herr Bomasch , what is even more important ... your daughter will be able to live with you or wherever she pleases .
-you must give me time to think .
-Certainly .
we should be in Munich in ... 40 minutes .
indeed . for the first time , I will be sorry when the journey &apos;s over .
Yes . I — I can believe that .
I think we should order something to eat .
an excellent idea .
just in case we do not find headquarters in a very ... hospitable frame of mind .
-Please .
-Oh , sorry .
you don &apos;t choose to stand up when a German officer passes ?
you see , we &apos;re English .
your passports .
Oh , beg your pardon . you &apos;re quite right .
the English should not stand up .
they should go down on their fat bellies and crawl .
-Now look here !
we shall generously permit you to run back to England ... no doubt to find yourselves safe jobs .
very well .
Meanwhile , you may sit down .
- &apos; &apos; Fat bellies . &apos; &apos; - &apos; &apos; Safe jobs . &apos; &apos;
as if they weren &apos;t all taken by now anyway .
Caldicott , this is absolutely and finally the last straw .
-Yes , Charters .
-we &apos;ll warn Dicky Randall at once , come what may .
I &apos;m with you , old man .
it &apos;s things like that that bring it home to you .
sandwiches , biscuits . Yes , sir .
will you take tea substitute or coffee substitute ?
tea for me , please .
-Tea .
-Fine .
he &apos;s in there . that Gestapo fellow &apos;s there too .
Yes .
a couple of storm troopers in there .
how the devil are we going to pass him the word without that fellow spotting it ?
-we &apos;ve got to do it somehow .
-Yes .
of course , he — he might come out for a minute . I mean , most people do .
we must act , Charters . it &apos;s no good hanging about on the off chance .
excuse , please .
-Wait a minute . that steward .
-What about him ?
well , he &apos;s bound to come back sometime to bring their order .
by Jove , yes .
here he comes .
- ? ( whistling ) -Excuse , please .
-Oh , what — what time do we get to Munich ?
-In about 30 minutes , sir .
thank you .
-All right ?
-Yes . I put it underneath a doughnut .
good . what ?
but how do you know they &apos;re for him ?
well , I suddenly remembered that Dicky Randall always had doughnuts ... sent up to his room for afternoon tea .
that &apos;s very clever of you , old man .
-Better get along there , hey ?
-Mmm , right .
-Oh , my Lord .
-Why , what &apos;s up ?
why , I &apos;m — I &apos;m wondering if it was doughnuts .
-What ?
-I — I believe it was rock cakes .
have you made all arrangements for transport at Munich , Marsen ?
every arrangement , sir .
-Will there be more than one car ?
-Almost certainly two .
then let &apos;s see , that will make seven . rather a crowd .
I think in order to finish my talk with Herr Bomasch , you had better take the second car .
very good , sir .
I believe Herr Bomasch is really beginning to see that I am doing my best to help him .
I &apos;m sure he knows that .
Yes , yes , Major . your attitude has been most reasonable .
you must remember it &apos;s only a few hours since Father was taken out of England by force .
Captain Marsen was only obeying orders .
members of the Gestapo are frequently asked to perform duties ... which others find too objectionable .
some are objectionable .
others I find extremely satisfying .
I often envy you your opportunities .
what is that , the bill ?
I will pay .
no , please . I am escorting the party .
my dear Marsen , it &apos;s my privilege .
in fact , it is an order .
terrible . the way prices have gone up already .
excuse me .
-Yes , I-I &apos;m Randall .
-How are you , old man ?
-you remember me ?
-Yes .
-This is Charters , an old friend of mine .
-How do you do ? well , what is it ?
-we don &apos;t know what you &apos;re up to , of course .
-Never mind about that .
but whatever it is , you appear to be on the spot . tell him about it , Charters .
well , I was phoning Berlin about my golf clubs .
by the way , I &apos;m resigned to the fact I shall never see them again , Caldicott .
-Yes , well , get on with it .
-I was just coming to that .
I was telephoning and got on the other chap &apos;s line — you know , that Gestapo fellow .
I overheard him saying they were sending a military escort ... to arrest you when you get to Munich .
you see , you &apos;re rumbled . they know that you &apos;re not Herzoff .
now listen . I can &apos;t tell you everything . there isn &apos;t time .
but I &apos;ve got to get that old man and the girl out of this country at all costs .
Oh , a — an official job .
are you two fellows game to help me ?
what , against Germany ?
I &apos;ll say we are after all they &apos;ve done to us . what do you say , Caldicott ?
-Absolutely , old man . backs to the wall .
-I hope not .
I say , could you give me a little more room to think ?
-Is there any tea left ?
-Yes , I think so , Ulrich .
there &apos;s no time for tea . we reach Munich in a few minutes .
Oh , time for just one cup . cake , darling ?
no , thank you .
I am afraid I must ask you to drop this little comedy .
it is very entertaining , but I have certain formalities to attend to .
comedy ?
what do you mean ?
Oh , thank you .
you &apos;re merely pretending to be infatuated with this man .
there &apos;s no such person as Major Herzoff .
he &apos;s a British agent trying to get you and your father out of Germany .
you must be crazy .
Ulrich .
I don &apos;t propose to waste the time of the Gestapo denying it .
thank you .
you — You &apos;re going to give yourself up ?
well , they have lots of proof , Mr. Bomasch .
an escort will be waiting at Munich to take you in charge .
you can &apos;t do this .
-He &apos;s an enemy agent .
-Weren &apos;t you ?
didn &apos;t you do exactly the same as he &apos;s doing ?
with a slight but important difference . I wasn &apos;t caught .
-Are you just going to sit there and do nothing ?
-Now , please don &apos;t make a scene .
-Don &apos;t you realize what this means ?
-Yes , I do .
but he has a gun , and I haven &apos;t . and he &apos;s got a couple of reserves next door .
who do you take me for — Bulldog Drummond ?
can &apos;t you be serious even now ?
I told you this would happen .
I told you your scheme was absolutely childish , but you wouldn &apos;t listen to me .
why didn &apos;t you stay in England instead of coming over here ... and deliberately throwing your life away , you fool ?
I have no time to listen to this ridiculous display .
Steiner !
Dreimund !
if there is more than one major on the train ... how are we to know which one to arrest ?
our man &apos;s got a Gestapo officer watching him .
Hmm . who has not these days ?
--The train .
-Heil Hitler .
-Heil Hitler !
Marsen . I &apos;m on instruction from Fifth Army Headquarters to arrest Major Herzoff .
I fear you will need a stretcher .
the prisoner tried to escape , and I had to , uh — to deal with him .
you will find him in the last compartment , Coach 66 .
uh , what — what transport have you ?
-Two cars .
-Excellent .
now , this is Herr Axel Bomasch from Harska and his daughter .
they are in protective custody , and I have instructions ... to take them to General Von Komwitz without delay .
with your permission , I will use one of the cars .
-Certainly .
-I &apos;ll leave you to take charge of the prisoner .
will you show me my car ?
-Brunner .
take this S.S. officer to the car .
-Coach 66 you said ?
-The last compartment .
full length on the seat .
sergeant , get a stretcher from the stationmaster and follow me .
Olson , you will take the S.S. officer and his party in your car .
one moment . is your chauffeur to be trusted ?
I think so . he is a very old member of the party .
Anti-Russian perhaps . I think I &apos;d rather take one of my own men .
-I &apos;m traveling to a place of the greatest secrecy .
-Very good .
-you will not be needed , Olson .
-Very good , sir .
Rumplemeyer , you will drive .
-Heil Hitler .
-Heil Hitler .
-Heil Hitler .
-Heil Hitler .
come on , quick .
right , man ! right ! you &apos;re not in England .
-Oh , I &apos;d forgotten .
not much of a life , a secret agent .
and the pay is bad too , sir .
I was just thinking , Charters .
in the last war , the army took over Lord &apos;s Cricket Ground for drilling troops on .
-Wonder if they &apos;ll do it this time .
-Shortsighted , you know .
better pull up here , Charters . we can &apos;t get to Switzerland by any of the main roads .
let me take over , will you ?
age around 22 , height 5 &apos; 4&apos; &apos; .
slim figure , dark , brown eyes .
that &apos;s the lot . phone these descriptions to all stations within a hundred-mile radius .
a report has just come in , sir , that the car has left the city by the south road .
so they are making for Switzerland .
-we take the road .
-Very good .
there &apos;s one thing that &apos;s worrying me , Randall , old man .
it may be silly of me , of course , but —
how exactly are we going to get across the Swiss frontier ?
I know a little place where I used to go climbing — about 8,000 feet up where Switzerland and Germany meet .
you &apos;re not going to ask us to hang about on ropes , I hope .
I &apos;m not , but they may . there &apos;s a narrow road leads right to the top .
-What &apos;s over the top ?
-Switzerland .
-Anything in between ?
-6,000-feet drop .
-Well , how can we , uh —
-Skip it .
skip it ?
-There &apos;s a car following us !
-Is there ?
well , here we go .
don &apos;t let them get away !
I &apos;ll have to change the wheel !
watch the road , Charters .
Hello ! anybody here ?
Caldicott .
anybody around ?
-Switzerland .
good morning to you , sir .
good morning .
-Are you in charge here ?
-Yes . there &apos;s only me .
-I want to cross to Switzerland .
-Now , sir ?
-Yes , now .
-But we &apos;re at war .
I had orders yesterday to close the teleferic .
my orders come from a higher source .
higher than the chief of police at Maxberg ?
-Gestapo headquarters at Munich .
-Oh .
I have been instructed to show this lady and gentleman safely out of Germany .
I better ring Christopher .
Yes . right away .
-There &apos;s a car coming . looks like them .
-There are five of them altogether .
-Keep an eye on them .
-How are the goats , Christopher ?
Yes , thank you , Christopher . I got it .
and the butter .
do you want to be dismissed for incompetence ?
they &apos;ll be leaving in about two minutes , Christopher .
I shall require to see your papers , sir . have you got your passports ?
how long does this take to cross the valley ?
-About four minutes .
-Once it &apos;s in midair , can it be stopped ?
why , yes , sir , if anyone wanted to stop it .
will you follow me to the office ?
this way , please .
-Can you see them ?
-No , but I can hear the engine .
-How does this thing work ?
-That shouldn &apos;t be difficult .
-Well , how ?
-Yes , obviously , this starts it .
-Yes ?
-Yes . this is the speed regulator .
-Speed regulator , right . get in quick .
-All of you ! quick ! Caldicott !
-What about you ?
-I &apos;ll start it and then jump on .
they &apos;re here !
-Come on . jump in .
-Yes , but they-they &apos;ll stop us halfway across .
get in , will you !
come on ! quickly !
there it is !
stand aside !
Olson , go around back !
the téléférique !
they &apos;re potting at us !
duck down !
get down there and draw his fire .
I &apos;ll get in over the roof .
right .
come here and stop the machinery ! come back !
when you wish upon a star
makes no difference who you are
anything your heart desires Will come to you
if your heart is in your dream
no request is too extreme
when you wish upon a star
as dreamers do
fate is kind
she brings to those who love
the sweet fulfillment of
their secret longing
like a bolt out of the blue
fate steps in And sees you through
when you wish upon a star
your dreams Come true
pretty .
I &apos;ll bet a lot of you folks don &apos;t believe that , about a wish coming true , do you ?
well , I didn &apos;t either .
of course , I &apos;m just a cricket singing my way from hearth to hearth , but let me tell you what made me change my mind .
one night a long time ... Pardon me .
wait till I fix this thing .
there .
one night a long time ago , my travels took me to a quaint little village .
it was a beautiful night .
the stars were shining like diamonds , high above the roofs of that sleepy old town .
pretty as a picture .
as I wandered along the crooked streets , there wasn &apos;t a soul to be seen .
the only sign of life was a lighted window in the shop of a wood-carver named Geppetto .
so I hopped over and looked in .
it was a shame to see a nice cheerful fire like that going to waste .
so what do I do ?
I go in !
I looked around .
of course , being in a strange place like that ,
I didn &apos;t know what to expect .
a cricket can &apos;t be too careful , you know .
soon as I saw there was no one about , I made myself at home .
as I stood there warming my ...
... myself , I took a look around .
well , sir , you never saw such a place .
the most fantastic clocks you ever laid your eyes on , and all carved out of wood .
and cute little music boxes , each one a work of art .
and shelf after shelf of toys and ...
and then something else caught my eye .
a puppet !
you know , one of those marionette things , all strings and joints .
cute little fellow .
going up ?
good piece of wood too .
well , now , it won &apos;t take much longer .
just a little more paint and he &apos;s all finished .
I think he &apos;ll be all right . don &apos;t you , Figaro ?
beg pardon .
see ?
that makes a big difference .
very good .
very , very good .
well , you can &apos;t please everybody .
now I have just the name for you .
Pinocchio !
do you like it , Figaro ?
no ?
you do , don &apos;t you , Cleo ?
well , we &apos;ll leave it to little woodenhead .
do you like it ?
that settles it !
Pinocchio it is !
come on , now , we &apos;ll try you out .
music , Professor !
take it easy there !
break it up , will you ?
Lotta down beats in there .
little woodenhead go play your part
bring a little joy to every heart
little do you know and yet it &apos;s true
that I &apos;m mighty proud of you
little wooden feet and best of all
little wooden seat in case you fall
how graceful !
my little woodenhead
Cleo , meet Pinocchio .
say , &quot; How do you do ? &quot;
say hello to Figaro .
up to mischief already .
you see what happens ?
up we go !
you &apos;re a cute little fellow .
and that smile !
you know , I ...
you rascal ! jealous ?
you know , Pinocchio , I think Figaro is jealous of you .
don &apos;t worry , Figaro .
I wonder what time it is ?
it &apos;s getting late .
come now . we go to bed .
good night , Pinocchio .
little funny face .
good night , Cleo , my little water baby .
Figaro you say good night too .
go on !
now go to sleep , my little mermaid .
good night .
this is my idea of comfort .
solid comfort .
look at him , Figaro .
he almost looks alive !
wouldn &apos;t it be nice if he was a real boy ?
Oh , well .
come on . we go to sleep .
I forgot to open the window .
Figaro , look , look , the wishing star !
star light , star bright , first star I see tonight ,
I wish I may , I wish I might , have the wish I make tonight .
Figaro , you know what I wished ?
I wished that my little Pinocchio might be a real boy .
wouldn &apos;t that be nice ? just think .
a real boy .
a very lovely thought , but not at all practical .
a real boy .
quiet !
after all , enough &apos;s enough .
now what &apos;s up ?
Hey , what &apos;s going on here ?
as I live and breathe , a fairy !
good Geppetto , you have given so much happiness to others .
you deserve to have your wish come true .
little puppet made of pine , wake .
the gift of life is thine .
what they can &apos;t do these days .
I can move !
I can talk !
I can walk !
- Yes , Pinocchio , I &apos;ve given you life .
- Why ?
because , tonight , Geppetto wished for a real boy .
- Am I a real boy ?
- No , Pinocchio .
to make Geppetto &apos;s wish come true will be entirely up to you .
up to me ?
prove yourself brave , truthful and unselfish , and someday you will be a real boy .
a real boy !
- That won &apos;t be easy .
- You must learn to choose - between right and wrong .
- Right and wrong ?
but how will I know ?
- How &apos;ll he know !
- Your conscience will tell you .
- What are conscience ?
- What are conscience !
I &apos;ll tell ya !
a conscience is that still , small voice that people won &apos;t listen to .
that &apos;s just the trouble with the world today .
- Are you my conscience ?
- Who , me ?
would you like to be Pinocchio &apos;s conscience ? well ...
very well .
what is your name ?
cricket &apos;s the name .
Jiminy Cricket .
kneel , Mr. Cricket .
no tricks now .
I dub you Pinocchio &apos;s conscience .
Lord high keeper of the knowledge of right and wrong , counselor in moments of temptation and guide along the straight and narrow path .
Arise , Sir Jiminy Cricket .
well !
my , my !
say , that &apos;s pretty swell .
gee , thanks !
- But don &apos;t I get a badge or somethin &apos; ?
- Well , we &apos;ll see .
- You mean , maybe I will ?
- I shouldn &apos;t wonder .
- Make it a gold one ?
- Maybe .
now remember , Pinocchio , be a good boy .
and always let your conscience be your guide .
- Goodbye , milady .
- Goodbye .
not bad , says I .
Oh , yeah !
almost forgot about you .
well , Pinoke ...
maybe you and I had better have a little heart-to-heart talk .
why ?
well , you want to be a real boy , don &apos;t you ?
all right , sit down , son .
now , you see , the world is full of temptations .
- Temptations ? - Yep !
Temptations .
they &apos;re the wrong things that seem right at the time , but even though the right things may seem wrong sometimes , sometimes the wrong things may be right at the wrong time , or vice versa .
understand ?
but I &apos;m gonna do right .
Attaboy , Pinoke , and I &apos;m gonna help ya .
and anytime you need me , you know , just whistle .
like this .
like this ?
no , no . try it again , Pinoke .
like this ?
no , son .
now listen !
that &apos;s it !
come on , now . let &apos;s sing it !
when you get in trouble and you don &apos;t know right from wrong
give a little whistle
give a little whistle
when you meet temptation and the urge is very strong
give a little whistle
give a little whistle
not just a little squeak Pucker up and blow
- And if your whistle &apos;s weak , yell
- Jiminy Cricket ?
take the straight and narrow path
and if you start to slide give a little whistle
give a little whistle
and always let your conscience be your guide
take the straight and narrow path
and if you start to slide Give a little whistle
give a little whistle
and always let your conscience be your guide
and always let your conscience be your guide
- Who is there ?
- It &apos;s me .
Oh , it &apos;s me .
there &apos;s somebody in here .
careful now , Figaro .
he might spring out on us at any time .
he &apos;s in here somewhere .
here I am !
how did you get down here ?
- I fell down .
- Oh , you did .
you are talking .
- No , no , no !
- Yes !
and I can move too !
no , no , you can &apos;t !
I &apos;m dreaming in my sleep !
wake me up !
wake me up !
now we see who &apos;s dreaming .
go on ... say something .
gee , you &apos;re funny .
- Do it again !
- You do talk ! Yes !
the blue fairy came .
- The blue fairy ?
- And I got a conscience .
- A conscience !
- And , someday , I &apos;m gonna be a real boy .
a real boy !
it is my wish , it &apos;s come true !
Figaro , look !
he &apos;s alive , he can talk !
say hello to Figaro .
Hello to Figaro .
I almost forgot .
look , it &apos;s Pinocchio !
she &apos;s my little water baby .
isn &apos;t she cute ? Yeah , cute !
this calls for a celebration !
music !
you start one , Pinocchio .
Oh , boy . a party !

how &apos; bout sitting out the next one , babe ?
Lemme out !
come , Cleo , join the party !
dance !

gathering toys
for my little boy

where &apos;s the bucket ?
help ! water !
- Water ! - Here it is !
I got it ! here &apos;s water .
here &apos;s some water .
help !
where &apos;s water ?
that was close .
maybe we &apos;d better go to bed before something else happens .
little man , you &apos;ve had a busy night .
now , close your eyes and go to sleep . why ?
everybody has to sleep .
Figaro goes to sleep , and Cleo .
and , besides , tomorrow you &apos;ve got to go to school .
- Why ?
- Oh , to learn things ...
- ... and get smart .
- Why ?
because .
look , Father . look !
- Wait ! stand still now .
- What are those ?
Oh , those !
they are your schoolmates , girls and boys . now get in .
- Real boys ?
- Yes !
but hurry now .
wait , wait , wait !
here &apos;s an apple for the teacher .
now turn around and let me look you over .
Yeah , yeah . here .
run along now .
wait , wait .
come back here , Figaro .
school is not for you .
- Goodbye , Father !
- Goodbye , son .
hurry back .
Gideon , listen .
the merry laughter of little innocent children wending their way to school .
thirsty little minds rushing to the fountain of knowledge .
school , a noble institution .
what would this stupid world be without ...
well , well , well !
so that old rascal &apos;s back in town ?
remember , Giddy , the time I tied strings on you and passed you off as a puppet ?
we nearly put one over on that old gypsy that time !
a little wooden boy .
now , who ...
a wooden boy !
look , Giddy , look. it &apos;s amazing .
a live puppet without strings .
a thing like that ought to be worth a fortune to someone .
now let me see . that &apos;s it !
Stromboli !
why , that fat , old faker would give his ...
listen .
if we play our cards right , we &apos;ll be on easy street , or my name isn &apos;t Honest John .
quick ! we &apos;ll head him off .
now &apos;s our ...
no , no , stupid .

Yes , Giddy , as I was saying to the duchess only yesterday ...

- I do hope you &apos;re not injured .

- Here &apos;s your book .
- I &apos;m going to school .

ladies and gentlemen , to conclude the performance of this great show ,
Stromboli , the master showman ...
that &apos;s me .
... and by special permission of the management ...
that &apos;s me too .
... is presenting to you something you will absolutely refuse to believe !
well , looks like a sellout .
introducing the only marionette who can sing and dance absolutely without the aids of strings .
the one ... and only ... Pinocchio !
what a buildup .
I got no strings to hold me do ...
go ahead ... make a fool of yourself !
then , maybe , you &apos;ll listen to your conscience .
I got no strings to hold me down
to make me fret or make me frown
I had strings , but now I &apos;m free
there are no strings on me
heigh ho the merry-o
that &apos;s the only way to be
I want the world to know Nothing ever worries me I got no strings ...
what I told you ?
they got strings , but you can see
there are no strings on me
you have no strings Your arms is free
to love me by the Zuider Zee
Ya-ya-ya if you would woo

you &apos;ve got no strings Comme ci comme ça
your savoir faire is ooo-la-la
I &apos;ve got strings , but entre nous
I &apos;d cut my strings for you
down where the Volga flows
there &apos;s a Russian rendezvous
where me and Ivan go but I &apos;d rather go with you
there are no strings on me
they like him .
he &apos;s a success .
maybe I was wrong .
well , guess he won &apos;t need me anymore .
what does an actor want with a conscience anyway ?
what could have happened to him ?
where could he be at this hour ?
I &apos;d better go out again and look for him .
and , remember , nobody eats a bite until I find him .
I got no strings , but I got the brain
I got no strings , but I got the brain
I buy a new suit and I swing the cane
I eat the best and I drink champagne
I got no strings on me
- Bravo , Pinocchio !
- They liked me !
two hundred .
- You are sensational !
- You mean I &apos;m good ?
three hundred .
you are colossal !
does that mean I &apos;m an actor ?
I will push you in the public &apos;s eye .

Oh , is that so ?
now , don &apos;t you worry , son .
I &apos;ll have you outta here in no time at all .

kinda rusty .
needs a little oil .
that &apos;s what I said .
must be one of the old models .
you mean , you can &apos;t open it ?
Yeah .
looks pretty hopeless .
it &apos;ll take a miracle to get us outta here .
a fine conscience I turned out to be .
I shoulda listened to you , Jiminy .
no , it was my fault .
I shouldn &apos;t have walked out on you .
guess I &apos;ll never see my father again .
buck up , son. it could be worse .
be cheerful ...
like me !
take it easy , son .
come on , blow .
Attaboy .
well , it stopped raining anyway .
well , it stopped raining anyway .
Hey , that star again !

- Hello !
- Sir Jiminy !
well ! this is a pleasant surprise !
Pinocchio , why didn &apos;t you go to school ?
school ?
go ahead , tell her .
I was going to school &apos; til I met somebody .
- Met somebody ?
- Yeah , two big monsters !
with big green eyes .
why , I ...
monsters ?
weren &apos;t you afraid ?
no , ma &apos;am . but they tied me in a big sack .
you don &apos;t say !
- And where was Sir Jiminy ?
- Leave me outta this .
- They put him in a little sack .
- No !
- Yeah !
- How did you escape ? - I didn &apos;t .
they chopped me into firewood !
Oh , look , my nose !
what &apos;s happened ?
perhaps you haven &apos;t been telling the truth .
- Perhaps ?
- But I have !
every single word !
please help me .
I &apos;m awful sorry .
you see , Pinocchio , a lie keeps growing and growing until it &apos;s as plain as the nose on your face .
she &apos;s right , Pinoke , you better come clean .
I &apos;ll never lie again , honest , I won &apos;t .
please , your honor , I mean ...
give him another chance , for my sake .
will ya , huh ?
I &apos;ll forgive you this once .
but , remember , a boy who won &apos;t be good might just as well be made of wood .
we &apos;ll be good , won &apos;t we ?
very well , but this is the last time I can help you .
gee , look , Jiminy ! my nose !
Hey , we &apos;re free .
come on , Pinoke .

a slight touch of monetary complications with bucolic semi-lunar contraptions of the flying trapezes .

I thought we &apos;d never make it .
certainly feels good to be back on dry land .
come on , let &apos;s get home .
- Father , Father , I &apos;m home !
- We &apos;re home , Mr. Geppetto .
home again .
it &apos;s me , Pinocchio !
I &apos;m home to stay .
here he is , Mr. Geppetto .
home at last .
Hey , maybe he &apos;s asleep .
father ?
father , it &apos;s me .
Pinoke , come here .
look .
he ain &apos;t here .
- He ... He &apos;s gone .
- Yeah , and Figaro .
and Cleo too .
maybe something awful happened to him .
don &apos;t worry , son , he probably hasn &apos;t gone far .
it &apos;s a message .
- What &apos;s it say ?
- It &apos;s about your father .
- Where is he ?
- Why , it says here he went looking for you and he was swallowed by a whale .
- Swallowed by a whale ?
- Yeah . a whale ?
a whale named Monstro .
- But wait , he &apos;s alive . - Alive ?
where ?
why , inside the whale at the bottom of the sea .
bottom of the sea ?
- Hey , where you going ?
- I &apos;m going to find him .
Pinoke , are you crazy ?
- Don &apos;t you realize he &apos;s in a whale ?
- I &apos;ve gotta go to him .
Hey , Pinoke , wait !
listen here , son ...
but this Monstro , I &apos;ve heard of him .
he &apos;s a whale of a whale !
he swallows whole ships alive !
tie it good and tight now .
and , besides , it &apos;s dangerous .
- Bye , Jiminy .
- Goodbye ?
I may be live bait down there , but I &apos;m with ya .
come on ... let &apos;s go .
look out below !
Gangway , down there .
what a big place .
come on , Jiminy .
all right . soon as I take on some ballast .
one side , sister .
well ... so long .
put it in the wrong end .
no more privacy than a goldfish .
chilly .
father ?
father ?
Hey , Pinoke , wait for me !
father ?
father !
he ain &apos;t my father .
Mr. Geppetto !
Hey ! what the ...
Hey , let go !
run along , you little ... squirt .
what &apos;s the matter ? can &apos;t a fellow ...
I was only ...
we were only looking for Monstro .
that got &apos; em .
father ?
father ?
Hello .
can you tell me where we can find Monstro , the whale ?
gee ! they &apos;re scared .
pardon me , pearl , are you acquainted with Monstro , the whale ?
hold it there .
father ?
one side there , son .
come on , boys , break it up .
break it up now .
Hey ! what the ...
Whoa , quit shoving &apos; .
don &apos;t crowd .
take it easy there .
steady there , Nellie .
go ahead , Pinoke , ask them .
could any of you tell me where to find Monstro ?
sakes alive .
father ?
- Father ?
- Mr. Geppetto ?
not a bite for days .
we can &apos;t hold out much longer .
I never thought ...
it would end this way , Figaro .
starving to death in the belly of a whale .
my poor little Pinocchio .
he was such a good boy .
it &apos;s hopeless , Figaro .
there isn &apos;t a fish left .
if the monster doesn &apos;t wake up soon ,
I &apos;m afraid we ... we are done for .
here they come !
tuna !
Oh , tuna fish !
food ! we &apos;ll eat !
here &apos;s a big one .
keep them in there , Figaro .
wait !
wait a minute !
have you seen ...
we gotta get outta here .
come on , Pinoke . don &apos;t wait for me !
never saw so many !
here &apos;s another one .
enough for weeks !
here &apos;s a big one .
keep them in there , Figaro !
Hey , blubber mouth , open up .
I gotta get in there .
looks like the last of them .
here &apos;s a big one . only a few left .
we gotta work fast .
- Hey !
- Here &apos;s another one .
Hey , Father !
- Father !
- Don &apos;t bother me now , Pinocchio .
- Father !
- Pinocchio , my son !
Hey , Father , here I am .
Oh , yes !
Pinocchio , my boy !
- I &apos;m so happy to see you .
- Me too , Father .
- You &apos;re here too .
- Yes ! we &apos;re all together again .
- You are soaking wet .
- Yes , Father .
- You mustn &apos;t catch cold .
- But I came to save you .
you know , you shouldn &apos;t have come down here .
- But , Father .
- But I &apos;m awfully glad to see you .
let me take your hat .
- What &apos;s the matter ?
- Those ears !
ears ?
Oh , these !
that &apos;s nothing .
I got a tail , too !
- What &apos;s happened to you ?
- Well , I ...
I ...
- I ...
- Never mind now .
old Geppetto has his little woodenhead .
nothing else matters !
I gotta get in ! my pal &apos;s in there .
come on , ya big moose ! open up , I tell ya !
Hey !
cut it out .
Hey , beat it , you buzzards !
get out ?
Oh , no , no , son .
I have tried every way .
why , I even built a raft .
a raft ? that &apos;s it !
we &apos;ll take the raft and when the whale opens his mouth ...
no , no , no , no . now , listen , son .
he only opens his mouth when he &apos;s eating .
then everything comes in , nothing goes out .
it &apos;s hopeless , Pinocchio .
come , we make a nice fire and we cook some of the fish . - A fire !
that &apos;s it !
- Yes !
and then we &apos;ll all eat again .
- A great big fire !
lots of smoke .
- Smoke ?
Yes , sure .
- A smoked fish will taste good .
- Quick , some wood .
Pinocchio , not the chair .
- Hurry , Father , more wood !
- What &apos;ll we sit on ?
we won &apos;t need it .
we &apos;re getting out !
getting out ? but how ?
- We &apos;ll make him sneeze !
- Make him sneeze ?
that will make him mad !
well , it &apos;s about time !
- It won &apos;t work .
- Hurry , Father .
climb aboard .
- We &apos;ll never get by those teeth !
- Yes , we will !
Hey , which way are you going ?
wait for me !
hang on .
here we go !
Gesundheit .
- We &apos;re going back !
- No , we &apos;ll make it .
faster , faster !
it &apos;s no use . we &apos;re done for !
we made it !
look !
now he is mad !
I told you he &apos;d be furious !
- He &apos;s gone .
- Where &apos;d he go ?
look out !
hang on !
he &apos;s coming back .
hurry !
he &apos;s trying to kill us !
paddle , son !
let &apos;s go back !
look out !
jump !
father ?
father ?
Oh , Father !
Pinocchio , swim for shore . swim for shore .
hang on , Father .
save ... yourself .
Pinocchio ... save yourself .
don &apos;t mind me , son .
save yourself ...
Pinocchio .
my boy !
my brave little boy .
prove yourself brave , truthful and unselfish and someday you will be a real boy .
awake , Pinocchio .
awake .
father , whatcha cryin &apos; for ?
because ... you &apos;re dead , Pinocchio .
no , I &apos;m not !
Yes , yes you are .
now lie down .
but , Father , I &apos;m alive .
see ?
and I &apos;m ...
I &apos;m ...
I &apos;m real !
I &apos;m a real boy !
you &apos;re alive and ...
and you are a real boy !
a real live boy .
this calls for a celebration !
Professor , lots of music !
well !
this is practically where I came in .
thank you , milady .
he deserved to be a real boy .
it sure was nice of you to ...
well , I &apos;ll be !
my , my !
solid gold too .
I think it &apos;s swell !
when your heart is in your dream
no request Is too extreme
when you wish Upon a star
your dreams
come true
you &apos;ll find your dreams come true
last night , I dreamt I went to Manderley again .
it seemed to me I stood by the iron gate leading to the drive , and for a while , I could not enter , for the way was barred to me .
then , like all dreamers ,
I was possessed of a sudden with supernatural powers and passed like a spirit through the barrier before me .
the drive wound away in front of me , twisting and turning as it had always done .
but as I advanced , I was aware that a change had come upon it .
nature had come into her own again , and little by little had encroached upon the drive with long , tenacious fingers .
on and on wound the poor thread that had once been our drive , and finally , there was Manderley .
Manderley , secretive and silent .
time could not mar the perfect symmetry of those walls .
moonlight can play odd tricks upon the fancy , and suddenly it seemed to me that light came from the windows .
and then a cloud came upon the moon and hovered an instant like a dark hand before a face .
the illusion went with it .
I looked upon a desolate shell with no whisper of the past about its staring walls .
we can never go back to Manderley again .
that much is certain .
but sometimes in my dreams , I do go back to the strange days of my life which began for me in the South of France .
no ! stop !
what the devil are you shouting about ?
who are you ? what are you staring at ?
I &apos;m sorry , I didn &apos;t mean to stare , but I ... I only thought ...
Oh , you did , did you ? well , what are you doing here ?
I was only walking .
well , get on with your walking . don &apos;t hang about here screaming .
I &apos;ll never come to Monte Carlo out of season again .
not a single well-known personality in the hotel .
stone cold . waiter ! Garcon !
call him . tell him to get me some ...
why , it &apos;s Max de Winter .
how do you do ?
I &apos;m Edythe Van Hopper .
it &apos;s so nice to run into you here , just when I was beginning to despair of finding any old friends here in Monte .
but do sit down and have some coffee .
Mr. De Winter is having some coffee with me .
go and ask that stupid waiter for another cup .
I &apos;m afraid I must contradict you .
you shall both have coffee with me .
Garcon . coffee , please .
- Cigarette ?
- No , thank you .
you know , I recognized you as soon as you came in , though I haven &apos;t seen you since that night at the casino at Palm Beach .
perhaps you don &apos;t remember an old woman like me .
are you playing the tables much here at Monte ?
no . I &apos;m afraid that sort of thing ceased to amuse me years ago .
I can well understand that .
as for me , if I had a home like Manderley ,
I should certainly never come to Monte .
I hear it &apos;s one of the biggest places in that part of the country , and you just can &apos;t beat it for beauty .
what do you think of Monte Carlo ? or don &apos;t you think of it at all ?
well , I think it &apos;s rather artificial .
she &apos;s spoiled , Mr. De Winter , that &apos;s her trouble .
most girls will give their eyes for a chance to see Monte .
wouldn &apos;t that rather defeat the purpose ?
now that we &apos;ve found each other again , I hope I shall see something of you .
you must come and have a drink in my suite .
I hope they &apos;ve given you a good room .
the place is empty , so if you &apos;re uncomfortable , mind you make a fuss .
your valet has unpacked for you , I suppose ?
I &apos;m afraid I don &apos;t possess one . perhaps you would like to do it for me ?
well , I ... I hardly think ...
perhaps you could make yourself useful to Mr. De Winter if he wants anything done .
you &apos;re a capable child in many ways .
that &apos;s a charming suggestion , but I &apos;m afraid I cling to the old motto ,
&quot; he travels fastest who travels alone . &quot; perhaps you &apos;ve not heard it .
what do you make of that ?
do you suppose that sudden departure was intended to be funny ?
come , don &apos;t sit there gawking , let &apos;s go upstairs .
- Have you got the key ?
- Yes , Mrs. Van Hopper .
I remember , when I was younger , there was a well-known writer who used to dart down the back way whenever he saw me coming .
I suppose he was in love with me and wasn &apos;t quite sure of himself .
well , c &apos;est la vie .
by the way , my dear , don &apos;t think that I mean to be unkind , but you were just a teeny-weeny bit forward with Mr. De Winter .
your effort to enter the conversation quite embarrassed me , and I &apos;m sure it did him .
men loathe that sort of thing . Oh , come , don &apos;t sulk .
after all , I am responsible for your behavior here .
perhaps he didn &apos;t notice it .
poor thing , I suppose he just can &apos;t get over his wife &apos;s death .
they say he simply adored her .
Oh ... How awkward of me .
what a stupid thing to do . Oh , I &apos;m so sorry .
please don &apos;t bother . it doesn &apos;t really matter .
no , leave that , leave that . go and lay another place at my table . - Mademoiselle will have lunch with me .
- Oh , but I couldn &apos;t possibly .
- Why not ?
- Oh , well , please don &apos;t be polite .
I ... It &apos;s very kind of you but I &apos;ll be all right if they just change the cloth .
I wasn &apos;t being polite .
I should have asked you to have lunch with me even if you hadn &apos;t upset the vase so clumsily .
come along .
we needn &apos;t talk to each other if we don &apos;t feel like it . well , thank you very much .
Oh , I ... I &apos;ll just have some scrambled eggs .
oui , mademoiselle .
- What &apos;s happened to your friend ?
- She &apos;s ill in bed with a cold .
I &apos;m sorry I was so rude to you yesterday .
the only excuse I can offer is that I &apos;ve become boorish through living alone .
you weren &apos;t really . you simply wanted to be alone and ...
tell me , is Mrs. Van Hopper a friend of yours or just a relation ?
no , she &apos;s my employer . I &apos;m what is known as &quot; a paid companion . &quot;
I didn &apos;t know companionship could be bought .
I looked at the word &quot; companion &quot; in the dictionary once .
it said , &quot; a friend of the bosom . &quot;
I don &apos;t envy you the privilege .
well , she &apos;s very kind , really , and I have to earn my living .
haven &apos;t you any family ?
no .
my mother died years and years ago , and there was only my father , and he died last summer .
and then I took this job .
how rotten for you .
Yes , it was rather , because , you see , we got on so well together .
you and your father ? Yes .
he was a lovely person , very unusual .
- What was he ?
- A painter . Ah !
was he a good one ?
well , I thought so , but people didn &apos;t understand him .
Yes , that &apos;s often the trouble .
he painted trees . at least , it was one tree .
you mean , he painted the same tree over and over again ? Yes .
you see , he had a theory that if you should find one perfect thing or place or person , you should stick to it .
do you think that &apos;s really silly ? not at all .
I &apos;m a firm believer in that myself .
and what did you find to do with yourself while he was painting his tree ?
well , I sat with him and I sketched a little . I don &apos;t do it very well , though .
were you going sketching this afternoon ?
Yes .
- Where ?
- Well , I haven &apos;t made up my mind .
I &apos;ll drive you somewhere in the car .
Oh , no , please , I didn &apos;t mean ...
Oh , nonsense . finish up that mess , and we &apos;ll get along . thank you .
it &apos;s very kind of you , but I &apos;m not very hungry . come on .
eat it up like a good girl .
you &apos;ve taken long enough for that sketch .
I shall expect a really fine work of art .
Oh , no , don &apos;t look at it . it &apos;s not nearly good enough .
well , it can &apos;t be as bad as all that . now don &apos;t rub it all out .
let me see it first . well , it &apos;s the perspective .
I never can get it right . let me see it , let me see it .
Oh , dear .
tell me , is it the perspective that gives my nose that curious twist in the middle ?
well , you &apos;re not a very easy subject to sketch .
your ...
your expression keeps changing all the time . does it ?
well , I &apos;d ...
I &apos;d concentrate on the view instead , if I were you .
much more worthwhile .
it rather reminds me of our coastline at home .
do you know Cornwall at all ?
Yes , I went there once with my father on holiday .
I was in a shop once , and I saw a postcard with a beautiful house on it , right by the sea .
I asked whose house it was , and the old lady said , &quot; That &apos;s Manderley . &quot;
I felt ashamed for not knowing .
Manderley is beautiful .
but to me , it &apos;s just the place where I was born , and have lived in all my life .
but now , I don &apos;t suppose I shall ever see it again .
we &apos;re lucky not to be home during the bad weather , aren &apos;t we ?
I can &apos;t ever remember enjoying swimming in England till June , can you ?
the water &apos;s so warm here that I could stay in all day .
there &apos;s a dangerous undertow and there was a man drowned here last year .
I never have any fear of drowning . have you ?
come , I &apos;ll take you home .
Oh , yes , I know Mr. De Winter well . I knew his wife , too .
before she married , she was the beautiful Rebecca Hildreth , you know .
she was drowned , poor dear , while she was sailing near Manderley .
he never talks about it , of course , but he &apos;s a broken man .
I suppose I &apos;d better have it . wretched stuff !
give me a chocolate , quick ! Oh , there you are .
it &apos;s about time .
hurry up . I want to play some rummy .
she was the beautiful Rebecca Hildreth , you know .
they say he simply adored her .
she was the beautiful Rebecca Hildreth , you know .
I suppose he just can &apos;t get over his wife &apos;s death .
she was the beautiful Rebecca Hildreth , you know .
but he &apos;s a broken man .
Bonjour .
- Well , where are you going ?
- I thought I &apos;d take a tennis lesson . I see .
I suppose you &apos;ve had a look at the pro , and he &apos;s desperately handsome , and you &apos;ve conceived a schoolgirl crush on him .
all right . go ahead . make the most of it .
off duty ?
well , yes .
Mrs. Van Hopper &apos;s cold &apos;s turned into flu , so she &apos;s got a trained nurse .
I &apos;m sorry for the nurse . you keen on tennis ?
- Well , not particularly .
- That &apos;s good . we &apos;ll go for a drive .
good afternoon , Mrs. Van Hopper . how are you feeling ?
you got on rather well with him , didn &apos;t you ?
that pro must have been teaching you other things than tennis .
hurry up , I want you to make some calls .
I wonder if Mr. De Winter is still in the hotel .
may I go now ?
for the number of lessons you &apos;ve had , you ought to be ready for Wimbledon .
but this will be your last , so make the most of it .
the trouble is , with me laid up like this , you haven &apos;t had enough to do .
I &apos;m getting rid of that nurse today .
and from now on , you &apos;ll stick to your job .
Yes , Mrs. Van Hopper .
- Nurse ?
- Yes , Mrs. Hopper ?
are you absolutely sure you left those messages for Mr. De Winter ?
- Why , yes , madame .
- I simply can &apos;t believe it .
he would most certainly have called me back . Oh , well .
poor boy , I simply hate to see him so alone .
you know , I ...
I wish there could be an invention that bottled up the memory , like perfume , and it never faded , never got stale .
then whenever I wanted to , I could uncork the bottle and live the memory all over again .
and what particular moment in your young life would you want to keep ?
all of them . all these last few days .
I feel as though I &apos;d ... I &apos;d collected a whole shelf full of bottles .
sometimes , you know , those little bottles contain demons that have a way of popping out at you , just as you &apos;re trying most desperately to forget .
stop biting your nails .
I wish I were a woman of 36 , dressed in black satin with a string of pearls .
you wouldn &apos;t be here with me if you were .
would you please tell me , Mr. De Winter , why you asked me to come out with you ?
it &apos;s obvious you want to be kind , but why do you choose me for your charity ?
I asked you to come out with me because I wanted your company .
you &apos;ve blotted out the past for me more than all the bright lights of Monte Carlo .
but if you think I just asked you out of kindness or charity , you can leave the car now and find your own way home .
go on . open the door and get out .
- Better blow your nose . - Thank you .
please don &apos;t call me Mr. De Winter .
I have a very impressive array of first names .
George Fortescue Maximilian .
you needn &apos;t bother with them all at once .
and another thing , please promise me never to wear black satin or pearls , or to be 36 years old .
Yes , Maxim .
for the love of Pete ! come here !
what do you think ? my daughter &apos;s engaged to be married . Oh , really ?
how nice !
we must leave for New York at once .
get reservations on the Aquitania , and we &apos;ll take the 12 : 30 train for Cherbourg .
hurry up and get me the maid to help with the packing .
we &apos;ve no time to waste . go on and don &apos;t dawdle .
Mr. De Winter , please .
he &apos;s gone out riding ?
he won &apos;t be back till noon ?
give me the porter , please .
I &apos;ll go and see if there &apos;s anything left in my room .
has Mr. De Winter come in yet ?
Oh , he has ?
would you connect me , please ?
I was looking for my book . I suppose I &apos;ve packed it .
well , come on , the car &apos;s waiting at the door .
I &apos;d like to leave a forwarding address , if they happen to find that book .
- Would you ring Mr. De Winter , please ?
- Yes , madame .
- There isn &apos;t any answer .
- Thank you . - Tell her to hurry up !
- Yes , madame .
I was looking for Mr. De Winter .
Mr. De Winter just ordered breakfast in his room , mademoiselle .
come in .
Hello . what are you doing here ? anything the matter ?
I &apos;ve come to say goodbye . we &apos;re going away .
what on Earth are you talking about ?
it &apos;s true .
we &apos;re going now , and I was afraid I wouldn &apos;t see you again .
- Where &apos;s she taking you to ?
- New York . I don &apos;t want to go .
I shall hate it . I shall be miserable .
I &apos;ll dress in here . I shan &apos;t be long .
which would you prefer , New York or Manderley ?
Oh , please don &apos;t joke about it . Mrs. Van Hopper &apos;s waiting .
I &apos;d better say goodbye now .
I &apos;ll repeat what I said .
either you go to America with Mrs. Van Hopper , or you come home to Manderley with me .
you mean you want a secretary or something ?
I &apos;m asking you to marry me , you little fool .
come in .
is that my food ? I &apos;m famished . I didn &apos;t have any breakfast .
my suggestion didn &apos;t seem to go at all well . sorry .
Oh , but you don &apos;t understand . it &apos;s the ...
- I &apos;m not the sort of person men marry .
- What on Earth do you mean ?
I don &apos;t belong in your sort of world , for one thing .
well , what is my sort of world ?
well , Manderley . you know what I mean .
well , I &apos;m the best judge of whether you belong there or not .
of course , if you don &apos;t love me , that &apos;s a different thing .
fine blow to my conceit , that &apos;s all .
I do love you . I love you most dreadfully .
I &apos;ve been crying all morning because I thought I &apos;d never see you again .
bless you for that .
I &apos;ll remind you of this one day and you won &apos;t believe me .
it &apos;s a pity you have to grow up .
well , now that &apos;s settled .
you may pour me out some coffee . two lumps of sugar and some milk , please .
same with my tea , don &apos;t forget .
who is going to break the news to Mrs. Van Hopper ?
shall you or should I ? you tell her .
she &apos;ll be so angry . what &apos;s the number of her room ?
she &apos;s not there . she &apos;s downstairs in the car .
Hello . give me the desk , please .
Hello . you &apos;ll find Mrs. Van Hopper waiting outside in her car .
would you ask her , with my compliments , if she &apos;d very kindly come up and see me in my room ?
Yes , in my room .
Mr. De Winter says please for you to come up to his room .
Mr. De Winter ?
why , certainly .
this isn &apos;t at all your idea of a proposal , is it ?
it should be in a conservatory , you in a white frock , with a red rose in your hand , and a violin playing in the distance , and I should be making violent love to you behind a palm tree .
poor darling . never mind .
I don &apos;t mind .
don &apos;t worry . don &apos;t worry . you won &apos;t have to say a word .
I &apos;m so glad you called me , Mr. De Winter .
I was making a hasty departure . it was so rude of me not to let you know .
but a cable came this morning announcing that my daughter is engaged to be married .
that &apos;s rather a coincidence , Mrs. Van Hopper .
I asked you up here in order to tell you of my engagement .
you don &apos;t mean it . how perfectly wonderful .
how romantic . who is the lucky lady ?
I apologize for depriving you of your companion in this abrupt way .
I do hope it won &apos;t inconvenience you too greatly .
when did all this happen ?
just now , Mrs. Van Hopper . just a few minutes ago .
I simply can &apos;t believe it .
and I suppose I ought to scold you for not having breathed a word of all of this to me .
what am I thinking of ? I should give you both my congratulations and my blessings .
I &apos;m very happy for you both . - When and where is the wedding to be ?
- Here , as soon as possible .
a whirlwind romance .
splendid ! I can easily postpone my sailing for a week .
this poor child has no mother , so I shall take responsibility for all the arrangements .
Trousseau , reception and everything , and I &apos;ll give the bride away .
but our luggage . go down and tell the porter to take everything out of the car .
just a minute .
we &apos;re most grateful , Mrs. Van Hopper , but I think we &apos;d both prefer to have it all as quiet as possible .
and I couldn &apos;t possibly allow you to change your sailing plans .
- Oh , but ...
- No , no , no . dear , I &apos;ll go down and see that your luggage is brought back .
thank you , Maxim .
so this is what &apos;s been happening during my illness .
tennis lessons , my foot .
I suppose I &apos;ve to hand it to you for a fast worker .
how did you manage it ? still waters certainly run deep .
tell me , have you been doing anything you shouldn &apos;t ?
- I don &apos;t know what you mean .
- Well , never mind .
I always did say that Englishmen have strange tastes .
you certainly have your work cut out as mistress of Manderley .
to be perfectly frank with you , my dear , I can &apos;t see you doing it .
you haven &apos;t the experience , you haven &apos;t the faintest idea what it means to be a great lady .
of course you know why he &apos;s marrying you , don &apos;t you ?
you haven &apos;t flattered yourself that he &apos;s in love with you ?
fact is , that empty house got on his nerves to such an extent , he nearly went off his head .
he just couldn &apos;t go on living alone .
you &apos;d better leave , Mrs. Van Hopper . you &apos;ll miss your train .
Mrs. De Winter .
Goodbye , my dear , and good luck !
monsieur ! what is he saying ?
he says I &apos;ve forgotten the proof that we &apos;re married .
good heavens .
somebody else had the same idea .
- Isn &apos;t she sweet ?
- Yes .
you &apos;d have liked a bridal veil , wouldn &apos;t you ?
or at least ...
Oh , Maxim , how lovely .
how perfectly lovely .
perfectly lovely .
welcome home , Mr. De Winter .
thank you , Smith .
- Cold , darling ?
- Yes , just a little bit .
there &apos;s no need to be frightened , you know .
just be yourself , and they &apos;ll all adore you .
you don &apos;t have to worry about the house at all .
Mrs. Danvers is the housekeeper . just leave it to her .
Hello . it &apos;s starting to rain . we &apos;d better hurry up .
here . have this . put it over your head .
thank you .
that &apos;s it . that &apos;s Manderley .
- Here we are . Frith , everybody well ?
- Yes , thank you , sir . glad to see you home , sir .
- This is Mrs. De Winter , Frith .
- How do you do ?
I didn &apos;t expect the whole staff to be in attendance .
Mrs. Danvers &apos; orders , sir .
Oh . sorry about this . it won &apos;t take long .
this is Mrs. Danvers .
how do you do ?
I have everything in readiness for you .
that &apos;s very good of you . I ... I didn &apos;t expect anything .
- I think we &apos;d like some tea , Frith .
- Ready in the library , sir . come along , darling .
Oh , Maxim , come in .
Oh . - Good evening , Mrs. Danvers .
- Good evening , madam .
- I hope Alice was satisfactory , madam .
- Oh , yes , thank you , perfectly .
she &apos;s the parlor maid .
she &apos;ll have to look after you until your own maid arrives .
Oh , but I haven &apos;t a maid . I &apos;m sure Alice will do very nicely .
I &apos;m afraid that would not do for very long , madam .
it &apos;s usual for ladies in your position to have a personal maid .
I hope you approve the new decoration of these rooms , madam ?
Oh , I didn &apos;t know it had been changed .
I hope you haven &apos;t been to too much trouble .
I only followed out Mr. De Winter &apos;s instructions .
well , what did it look like before ?
it had an old paper and different hangings .
it was never used much except for occasional visitors . Oh .
then it wasn &apos;t Mr. De Winter &apos;s room originally ? no , madam .
he &apos;s never used the east wing before .
of course , there &apos;s no view of the sea from here .
the only good view of the sea is from the west wing .
the room &apos;s very charming , and I &apos;m sure I &apos;ll be comfortable .
if there &apos;s anything you want done , madam , you have only to tell me .
I suppose you &apos;ve been at Manderley for many years , longer than anyone else .
not so long as Frith .
he was here when the old gentleman was living , when Mr. De Winter was a boy .
Oh , I see . and you didn &apos;t come till after that ?
I came here when the first Mrs. De Winter was a bride .
Mrs. Danvers , I do hope we &apos;ll be friends .
you must be patient with me .
this sort of life is new to me and I do want to make a success of it , and make Mr. De Winter happy , so I know I can leave all the household arrangements to you .
very well . I hope I shall do everything to your satisfaction , madam .
I &apos;ve managed the house since Mrs. De Winter &apos;s death and Mr. De Winter has never complained .
I think I &apos;ll go downstairs now .
that room in the west wing I was telling you about is there , through that door .
it &apos;s not used now .
it &apos;s the most beautiful room in the house , the only one that looks down across the lawns to the sea .
it was Mrs. De Winter &apos;s room .
- Good morning .
- Good morning .
- You &apos;re Mrs. De Winter , aren &apos;t you ?
- Yes .
my name &apos;s Crawley .
I manage the estate for Maxim .
awfully glad to meet you .
a fearful lot of stuff piled up while Maxim was away .
Yes , I &apos;m sure there must have been .
I do wish I could help with some of it . no , no !
Frank never allows anybody to help him .
he &apos;s like an old mother hen with his bills and rents and taxes .
come on , Frank , we must go over these estimates .
I &apos;ll get my papers .
you &apos;ll find quantities of breakfast over there .
but you must eat it all , or Cook will be mortally offended .
I &apos;ll do my best , Maxim .
I have to go over the place with Frank , just to make sure that he hasn &apos;t lost any of it .
you &apos;ll be all right , won &apos;t you ?
getting acquainted with your new home ?
have a look at The Times . there &apos;s a thrilling article on what &apos;s the matter with English cricket .
Oh , yes ...
my sister , Beatrice , and her husband , Giles Lacy , have invited themselves over for lunch .
- Today ? - Yes .
I suppose the old girl can &apos;t wait to look you over .
you &apos;ll find her very direct .
if she doesn &apos;t like you , she &apos;ll probably tell you so to your face .
don &apos;t worry , darling , I &apos;ll be back in time to protect you from her .
- Goodbye , darling .
- Goodbye , Maxim .
- Goodbye .
- Goodbye .
- Good morning , madam .
- Good morning , Frith .
isn &apos;t there anything I could get for you , madam ?
no , thank you , Frith . I &apos;m really not very hungry .
thank you .
- The paper , madam .
- Oh , yes . thank you , Frith .
I slipped .
thank you , Frith .
- It &apos;s big , isn &apos;t it ?
- Yes , madam , Manderley is a big place .
this was the banquet hall in the old days .
it &apos;s still used on great occasions , such as a big dinner or a ball .
and the public is admitted here , you know , once a week .
that &apos;s nice .
I beg pardon , madam .
I &apos;m afraid the fire is not usually lit in the library until the afternoon .
but you &apos;ll find one in the morning room .
of course , if you wish this fire lit now , madam ...
no , Frith , I wouldn &apos;t dream of it .
Mrs. De Winter ...
I mean , the late Mrs. De Winter always did her correspondence and telephoning in the morning room , after breakfast .
thank you , Frith .
is anything wrong , madam ?
Oh , no . which way is the morning room ?
Oh , it &apos;s that door there , on the left .
Oh , yes , thank you .
Mrs. De Winter ?
Oh , I &apos;m afraid you &apos;ve made a mistake .
Mrs. De Winter &apos;s been dead for over a year .
Oh , I mean ...
Oh . that was the house telephone , madam .
probably the head gardener wishing instructions .
did you want to see me , Mrs. Danvers ?
Mr. De Winter informed me that his sister , Mrs. Lacy , and Major Lacy are expected for luncheon .
I &apos;d like to know if you approve of the menu .
Oh , well , I &apos;m sure it &apos;s very suitable , very nice indeed .
you will notice , madam , that I &apos;ve left a blank space for the sauce .
Mrs. De Winter was most particular about sauces .
let &apos;s have whatever you think that Mrs. De Winter would have ordered .
thank you , madam .
when you &apos;ve finished your letters , Robert will take them to the post .
my ... My letters ?
Oh , yes , of course . thank you , Mrs. Danvers .
how are you , Frith ?
- Good morning , Mrs. Lacy .
where &apos;s Mr. De Winter ?
I believe he went down to the farm with Mr. Crawley .
how tiresome of him not to be here when we arrive , and how typical .
I must say old Danvers keeps the house looking lovely .
she &apos;s certainly learned that trick of arranging flowers from Rebecca .
I wonder how she likes it now , being ordered about by an ex-chorus girl .
now , where on Earth did you get the idea she &apos;s an ex-chorus girl ?
he picked her up in the South of France , didn &apos;t he ?
what if he did ?
well , I mean to say , there you are .
how do you do ? I &apos;m Maxim &apos;s wife .
how do you do ?
well , I must say you &apos;re quite different from what I expected .
don &apos;t be so silly . she &apos;s exactly what I told you she &apos;d be .
well , how do you like Manderley ?
it &apos;s very beautiful , isn &apos;t it ?
and how do you get along with Mrs. Danvers ?
well , I ... I &apos;ve never met anyone quite like her before .
you mean , she scares you .
she &apos;s not exactly an oil painting , is she ?
Giles , you &apos;re very much in the way here . go somewhere else .
well , I &apos;ll try and find Maxim , shall I ?
Giles .
I didn &apos;t mean to say anything against Mrs. Danvers .
Oh , there &apos;s no need for you to be frightened of her , but I shouldn &apos;t have any more to do with her than you can help .
- Shall we sit down ? - Yes .
Yes , please .
you see , she &apos;s bound to be insanely jealous at first and she must resent you bitterly .
but why should she ?
don &apos;t you know ? I should have thought Maxim would have told you .
she simply adored Rebecca .
- How are you , Robert ?
- Quite well , thank you , madam .
- Still having trouble with your teeth ?
- Unfortunately , yes , madam .
you must have them out , all of them . - Wretched nuisances , teeth .
- Thank you , madam .
what a plateful .
do you hunt ?
no , I don &apos;t . I &apos;m afraid I don &apos;t even ride .
you have to ride down here , we all do .
which do you ride , sidesaddle or astride ?
well , of course , I forgot . you don &apos;t , do you ?
you must .
nothing else to do around here . Maxim , when are you going to have parties here again , like the old days ?
I haven &apos;t thought about it .
- But everyone &apos;s dying to see you and ...
- Yes , I bet they are .
why don &apos;t you have the masquerade ball again this summer ?
my dear , are you fond of dancing ?
I love it , but I &apos;m not very good at it .
do you rumba ?
- Never tried .
- You must teach me .
actually , I &apos;m trying to find out exactly what your wife does do .
she sketches a little .
sketches .
not this modern stuff , I hope , you know , portrait of a lampshade upside down to represent a soul in torment .
don &apos;t sail , do you ?
no , I don &apos;t .
thank goodness for that . huh ?
you &apos;re very much in love with Maxim , aren &apos;t you ?
Yes , I can see you are .
don &apos;t mind my saying so , but why don &apos;t you do something about your hair ?
why don &apos;t you have it cut or sweep it back behind your ears ?
Oh , no , that &apos;s worse . what does Maxim say about it ?
does he like it like that ?
well , he never mentions it .
Oh , well , don &apos;t go by me .
I can see by the way you dress you don &apos;t care a hoot how you look .
but I wonder Maxim hasn &apos;t been at you .
he &apos;s so particular about clothes .
I don &apos;t think he ever notices what I wear .
Oh . he must have changed a lot , then .
you mustn &apos;t worry about old Maxim and his moods .
one never knows what goes on in that quiet mind of his .
often , he gets into a terrible rage , and when he does ...
I don &apos;t suppose he &apos;ll lose his temper with you .
you seem such a placid little thing .
come on , old girl . we &apos;ve got to go on the first tee at 3 : 00 .
all right , I &apos;m coming .
well , goodbye , Maxim , old boy .
Goodbye , Giles . thanks for coming , old boy .
Goodbye , my dear . forgive me for asking you so many rude questions .
we both really hope you &apos;ll be very happy .
thank you , Beatrice , thank you very much .
and I must congratulate you upon the way Maxim looks .
we were very worried about him this time last year .
but then , of course , you know the whole story .
Goodbye , Beatrice .
- Goodbye , old boy .
- Goodbye . - Goodbye .
well , thank heavens they &apos;ve gone . now we can have a walk about the place .
looks as though we might have a shower .
but you won &apos;t mind that , will you ? no , but wait a minute .
I &apos;ll go upstairs and get a coat .
there &apos;s a heap of mackintoshes in the flower room . Robert ?
run and get a coat from the flower room for Mrs. De Winter , will you ?
what do you think of Beatrice ?
Oh , I liked her very much , but she kept saying that I was quite different from what she expected .
Oh , someone smarter and more sophisticated , I &apos;m afraid .
do you like my hair ? your hair ?
Yes , of course I do .
what &apos;s the matter with it ? Oh , I don &apos;t know .
I just wondered .
how funny you are . thank you .
- Do I have to put it on ?
- Yes , certainly , certainly , certainly . you can &apos;t be too careful with children . come on , Jasper .
come and take some of that fat off .
Jasper ! here . not that way !
where does that lead to ?
Oh , it leads to a little cove where we used to keep a boat .
Oh , let &apos;s go down there . well , no .
it &apos;s a perfectly dull , uninteresting stretch of sand , - just like any other .
- Oh , please .
well , all right .
we &apos;ll walk down and take a look if you really want to .
that &apos;s Jasper . there must be something wrong . - Perhaps he &apos;s hurt himself .
- No , he &apos;s all right , leave him alone .
don &apos;t you think I &apos;d better go and see ?
don &apos;t bother about him , I tell you , he can &apos;t come to any harm . he &apos;ll find his own way back !
Jasper ! Jasper ?
Oh , there you are .
what do you want in there , Jasper ? come on . come on home .
Jasper ...
Oh . I didn &apos;t know that there was anybody ...
I know that dog . he comes from the house .
he ain &apos;t yours . no .
he &apos;s Mr. De Winter &apos;s dog .
have you anything I could tie him with ?
come on , Jasper .
you won &apos;t tell anyone you saw me in there , will you ?
don &apos;t you belong on the estate ?
I weren &apos;t doing nothing . I was just putting me shells away .
she &apos;s gone in the sea , ain &apos;t she ?
she &apos;ll never come back no more .
no . she &apos;ll never come back . come on , Jasper .
Maxim ! what &apos;s the matter ?
Maxim !
I &apos;m sorry I was such a time , but I had to find a rope for Jasper .
hurry up , Jasper , for heaven &apos;s sake .
please wait for me . Maxim , what is it ? you look so angry .
you knew I didn &apos;t want you to go there , but you deliberately went .
why not ?
there was only a cottage down there and a strange man who ...
- You didn &apos;t go in the cottage , did you ?
- Yes , the door was ...
- Don &apos;t go there again , do you hear ? - Well , why not ? because I hate the place .
and if you had my memories , you wouldn &apos;t go there or talk about it or even think about it .
what &apos;s the matter ? Oh , I &apos;m sorry , please . we should have stayed away .
we should never have come back to Manderley .
Oh , what a fool I was .
I &apos;ve made you unhappy . somehow , I &apos;ve hurt you .
Oh , I can &apos;t bear to see you like this because I love you so much .
do you ?
I &apos;ve made you cry . forgive me .
I sometimes seem to fly off the handle for no reason at all .
don &apos;t I ?
come , we &apos;ll go home and have some tea and forget all about it .
Yes , let &apos;s forget all about it .
here , let me have Jasper .
- Hello . come in .
- Oh , please don &apos;t get up , Mr. Crawley .
I was just wondering if you meant what you said the other day
- about showing me the run of things . - Of course I did .
what are you doing now ?
notifying all the tenants that in celebration of Maxim &apos;s return with his bride , this week &apos;s rent will be free .
Oh , is that Maxim &apos;s idea ? Oh , yes , all the servants get an extra week &apos;s wages , too .
Oh , he didn &apos;t tell me .
can &apos;t I help you ?
I could at least lick the stamps . well , that &apos;s terribly nice of you .
won &apos;t you sit down ?
Yes , thank you .
I was down at the cottage on the beach the other day .
there was a man there , a queer sort of person .
Jasper kept barking at him . Oh , yes , it must have been Ben .
excuse me .
he &apos;s quite harmless .
we give him odd jobs now and then .
that cottage bay seemed to be going to rack and ruin .
why isn &apos;t something done about it ?
I think if Maxim wanted anything done about it , he &apos;d tell me .
are those all Rebecca &apos;s things down there ?
Yes . Yes , they are .
what did she use the cottage for ?
the boat used to be moored near there . what boat ?
what happened to it ?
was that the boat she was sailing in when she was drowned ?
Yes . it capsized and sank . she was washed overboard .
wasn &apos;t she afraid to go out like that alone ?
she wasn &apos;t afraid of anything .
where did they find her ?
near Edgecombe , about 40 miles up channel about two months afterwards .
Maxim went up to identify her . it was horrible for him .
Yes , it must have been .
Mr. Crawley , please don &apos;t think me morbidly curious . it isn &apos;t that .
it &apos;s ... It &apos;s just that I feel at such a disadvantage .
all the time , whenever I meet anyone , Maxim &apos;s sister or even the servants ,
I know they &apos;re all thinking the same thing , that they &apos;re all comparing me with her , with Rebecca .
you mustn &apos;t think that .
I can &apos;t tell you how glad I am that you married Maxim .
it &apos;s going to make all the difference to his life .
from my point of view , it &apos;s very refreshing to find someone like yourself , who &apos;s not entirely in tune , shall we say , with Manderley .
that &apos;s very sweet of you .
I daresay I &apos;ve been stupid , but every day I realize the things she had that I lack .
beauty and wit and intelligence , and all the things that are so important in a woman .
you have qualities that are just as important , more important , if I may say so .
kindliness and sincerity , and if you &apos;ll forgive me , modesty , mean more to a husband than all the wit and beauty in the world .
we , none of us want to live in the past , Maxim least of all .
it &apos;s up to you , you know , to lead us away from it .
right .
I promise you I won &apos;t bring this up again , but before we end this conversation , would you answer just one more question ?
if it &apos;s something I &apos;m able to answer , I &apos;ll do my best .
tell me , what was Rebecca really like ?
I suppose ...
I suppose she was the most beautiful creature I ever saw .
good evening , Maxim . Hello .
the films of the honeymoon have arrived at last .
do we have time , do you think , before dinner ?
what on Earth have you done to yourself ?
Oh , nothing . I just ordered a new dress from London .
I hope you don &apos;t mind .
Oh , no , no . only , do you think that sort of thing &apos;s right for you ?
- It doesn &apos;t seem your type at all .
- I thought you &apos;d like it .
and what have you done to your hair ?
Oh , I see . dear , oh , dear .
I &apos;m sorry .
you look lovely , lovely .
it &apos;s very nice , for a change .
- Shall we see these pictures ? - Yes .
I &apos;d love to see them .
look now , look at that .
wasn &apos;t it wonderful , darling ? can &apos;t we go back there someday ?
Yes , of course . of course . look at you .
won &apos;t our grandchildren be delighted when they see how lovely you were ? Oh , look at you .
Oh , I like that .
look at that .
Yes , very nice .
- Remember that ?
Yes .
I wish our honeymoon could have lasted forever , Maxim .
dash it , look . hang it .
I &apos;ve threaded it up wrong as usual or something .
Yes , Frith . what is it ? excuse me , sir .
may I have a word with you ? Yes .
come in .
it &apos;s about Robert , sir .
there &apos;s been a slight unpleasantness between him and Mrs. Danvers . Oh , dear .
- Robert is very upset .
- This is trouble .
what is it ?
it appears that Mrs. Danvers has accused Robert of stealing a valuable ornament from the morning room .
Robert denies the accusation most emphatically , sir .
- What was the thing , anyway ?
- China cupid , sir . Oh , dear .
that &apos;s one of our treasures , isn &apos;t it ?
well , tell Mrs. Danvers to get to the bottom of it somehow .
- Tell her I &apos;m sure it wasn &apos;t Robert .
- Very good , sir . why do they come to me with these things ?
that &apos;s your job , sweetheart .
Maxim , I wanted to tell you , but I forgot .
the fact is , I broke the china cupid .
you broke it ?
now , why on Earth didn &apos;t you say something about it when Frith was here ? I don &apos;t know .
I didn &apos;t like to .
I was afraid he &apos;d think me a fool .
he &apos;ll think you much more of a fool now .
you &apos;ll have to explain to him and Mrs. Danvers . Oh , no , Maxim . you do it .
I &apos;ll go upstairs . don &apos;t be such a little idiot , darling .
anybody would think you were afraid of them .
it &apos;s all a mistake , Mrs. Danvers .
apparently , Mrs. De Winter broke the cupid herself and forgot to say anything about it .
I &apos;m so sorry . I never thought that I &apos;d get Robert into trouble .
is it possible to repair the ornament , madam ?
no , I &apos;m afraid it isn &apos;t . it smashed into pieces .
what did you do with the pieces ?
well , I put them at the back of one of the drawers in the writing desk .
well , it looks as though Mrs. De Winter was afraid you were going to put her in prison , doesn &apos;t it , Mrs. Danvers ?
well , never mind .
do what you can to find the pieces .
see if they can be mended , and above all , tell Robert to dry his tears .
I shall apologize to Robert , of course .
perhaps if such a thing happens again ,
Mrs. De Winter will tell me personally . Yes , yes , all right .
thank you , Mrs. Danvers .
well , I suppose that clip will hold all right . I don &apos;t know .
I &apos;m awfully sorry , darling . it was very careless of me .
- Mrs. Danvers must be furious with me . - Hang Mrs. Danvers .
why on Earth should you be frightened of her ?
you behave more like an upstairs maid or something ,
- not the mistress of the house at all .
- Yes , I know I do . but I feel so uncomfortable .
I try my best every day , but it &apos;s very difficult with people looking me up and down as if I were a prize cow .
what does it matter if they do ?
you must remember that life at Manderley is the only thing that interests anybody down here .
what a slap in the eye I must have been to them , then .
I suppose that &apos;s why you married me , because you knew I was dull and gauche and inexperienced , and there &apos;d never be any gossip about me .
gossip ?
what do you mean ?
I don &apos;t know . I just said it for something to say .
don &apos;t look at me like that .
Maxim . what &apos;s the matter ? what have I said ?
wasn &apos;t a very attractive thing to say , was it ? no .
it was rude , hateful .
I wonder if I did a very selfish thing in marrying you .
how do you mean ?
I &apos;m not much of a companion to you , am I ?
you don &apos;t get much fun , do you ?
you ought to have married a boy , someone of your own age .
Maxim , why do you say this ? of course we &apos;re companions . are we ?
I don &apos;t know .
- I &apos;m very difficult to live with .
- No , you &apos;re not difficult . you &apos;re easy , very easy .
our marriage is a success , isn &apos;t it , a great success ?
we &apos;re happy , aren &apos;t we ? terribly happy ?
if you don &apos;t think we are happy , it would be much better if you didn &apos;t pretend .
I &apos;ll go away .
why don &apos;t you answer me ?
how can I answer you when I don &apos;t know the answer myself ?
if you say we &apos;re happy , let &apos;s leave it at that .
happiness is something I know nothing about .
Oh , look .
there &apos;s the one when I left the camera running on the tripod , remember ?
pardon me , madam . is there anything I can do for you ?
I &apos;m all right , Hilda . thank you very much .
I &apos;ll bring the sandwiches immediately , madam .
- Hilda . - Yes , madam ?
the west wing .
nobody ever uses it anymore , do they ? no , madam .
not since the death of Mrs. De Winter .
come along , Mr. Jack , or someone may see you .
well , Danny , old harpy , it &apos;s been good to see you again .
I &apos;ve been simply breathless to pick up all the news .
I really don &apos;t think it &apos;s wise for you to come here , Mr. Jack . Jasper , come here .
Oh , nonsense , nonsense .
it &apos;s just like coming back home . quiet , Mr. Jack .
Yes .
we must be careful not to shock Cinderella , mustn &apos;t we ? she &apos;s in the morning room .
if you leave through the garden door , she won &apos;t see you .
I must say , I feel a little like the poor relation , sneaking around through back doors .
well , toodle-oo , Danny .
Goodbye , Mr. Jack , and please be careful .
Jasper , be quiet .
looking for me ? - I didn &apos;t make you jump , did I ?
- No . of course not . I didn &apos;t quite know who it was .
Yes . you &apos;re pleased to see me , aren &apos;t you , old boy ?
I &apos;m glad there &apos;s someone in the family to welcome me back to Manderley .
and how is dear old Max ?
very well , thank you .
I hear he went up to London , left his little bride all alone .
it &apos;s too bad .
isn &apos;t he rather afraid that somebody might come down and carry you off ?
Danny , all your precautions were in vain .
the mistress of the house was hiding behind the door .
Oh . what about presenting me to the bride ?
this is Mr. Favell , madam .
how do you do ?
- Won &apos;t you have some tea or something ?
- Now , isn &apos;t that a charming invitation ?
I &apos;ve been asked to tea , Danny , and I &apos;ve a good mind to accept .
Oh , well , perhaps you &apos;re right .
pity , just when we were getting on so nicely .
we mustn &apos;t lead the young bride astray , must we , Jasper ?
Goodbye . it &apos;s been fun meeting you .
Oh , and by the way , it would be very decent of you if you didn &apos;t mention this little visit to your revered husband .
he doesn &apos;t exactly approve of me .
- Very well .
- That &apos;s very sporting of you .
I wish I had a young bride of three months waiting for me at home .
I &apos;m just a lonely old bachelor .
Fare thee well .
Oh , and I know what was wrong with that introduction .
Danny didn &apos;t tell you , did she ? I am Rebecca &apos;s favorite cousin .
toodle-oo !
do you wish anything , madam ?
I didn &apos;t expect to see you , Mrs. Danvers .
I noticed that a window wasn &apos;t closed and I came up to see
- if I could fasten it . - Why did you say that ?
I closed it before I left the room .
you opened it yourself , didn &apos;t you ?
you &apos;ve always wanted to see this room , haven &apos;t you , madam ?
why did you never ask me to show it to you ?
I was ready to show it to you every day .
it &apos;s a lovely room , isn &apos;t it ?
loveliest room you &apos;ve ever seen .
everything is kept just as Mrs. De Winter liked it .
nothing has been altered since that last night . come .
I &apos;ll show you her dressing room .
this is where I keep all her clothes .
you would like to see them , wouldn &apos;t you ?
feel this .
it was a Christmas present from Mr. De Winter .
he was always giving her expensive gifts , the whole year round .
I keep her underwear on this side .
they were made specially for her by the nuns in the Convent of St. Claire .
I always used to wait up for her , no matter how late .
sometimes she and Mr. De Winter didn &apos;t come home until dawn .
while she was undressing , she &apos;d tell me about the party she &apos;d been to .
she knew everyone that mattered . everyone loved her .
when she finished her bath , she &apos;d go into the bedroom and go over to the dressing table .
Oh , you &apos;ve moved her brush , haven &apos;t you ?
there . that &apos;s better . just as she always laid it down .
&quot; come on , Danny . hair drill , &quot; she would say .
and I &apos;d stand behind her like this and brush away for 20 minutes at a time .
and then she would say , &quot; Good night , Danny , &quot;
I embroidered this case for her myself , and I keep it here always .
did you ever see anything so delicate ?
look . you can see my hand through it .
you wouldn &apos;t think she &apos;d been gone so long , would you ?
sometimes when I walk along the corridor ,
I fancy I hear her just behind me .
that quick light step . I couldn &apos;t mistake it anywhere .
not only in this room , it &apos;s in all the rooms in the house .
I can almost hear it now .
do you think the dead come back and watch the living ?
no , I don &apos;t believe it .
sometimes I wonder if she doesn &apos;t come back here to Manderley , and watch you and Mr. De Winter together .
you look tired . why don &apos;t you stay here a while and rest ?
and listen to the sea .
so soothing .
listen to it .
listen .
listen to the sea .
tell Mrs. Danvers I wish to see her immediately .
you sent for me , madam ?
Yes , Mrs. Danvers .
I want you to get rid of all these things .
- These are Mrs. De Winter &apos;s things .
- I am Mrs. De Winter now . very well .
just a moment , please .
Mrs. Danvers , I intend to say nothing to Mr. De Winter about Mr. Favell &apos;s visit .
in fact , I prefer to forget everything that happened this afternoon .
Maxim , Maxim , you &apos;ve been gone all day .
you &apos;re choking me .
well , well , well , what have you been doing with yourself ?
- I &apos;ve been thinking .
- What did you want to do that for ?
come in here and I &apos;ll tell you .
darling , could we have a costume ball just as you used to ?
now what put that into your mind ?
has Beatrice been at you ?
no , no , but I feel that we ought to do something to make people feel that Manderley is just the same as it always was .
Oh , please , darling , could we ?
you don &apos;t know what it would mean , you know .
you &apos;d have to be hostess to hundreds of people , all the county .
and a lot of young people would come up from London ,
- and turn the house into a nightclub .
- Oh , yes . but I want to . please .
I &apos;ve never been to a large party , but I could learn what to do .
and I promise you , you wouldn &apos;t be ashamed of me .
all right , if you think you &apos;d enjoy it .
you &apos;d better get Mrs. Danvers to help you out , won &apos;t you ?
no , no . I don &apos;t need Mrs. Danvers to help me .
I can do it myself .
all right , my sweet .
thank you , darling .
thank you . - What &apos;ll you go as ?
- I never dress up .
that &apos;s the one privilege I claim as the host .
what will you be ?
Alice in Wonderland , with that ribbon around your hair ?
no , I won &apos;t tell you .
I &apos;ll design a costume all by myself and give you the surprise of your life .
come in .
Robert found these sketches in the library , madam .
- Did you intend throwing them away ?
- Yes , Mrs. Danvers , I did .
they were just some ideas I was sketching for my costume for the ball .
hasn &apos;t Mr. De Winter suggested anything ?
no , I want to surprise him .
I don &apos;t want him to know anything about it .
I merely thought that you might find a costume among the family portraits that would suit you .
Oh , you mean those at the top of the stairs ? I &apos;ll go and look at them .
this one , for instance . might have been designed for you .
I &apos;m sure you could have it copied .
I &apos;ve heard Mr. De Winter say that this is his favorite of all the paintings .
it &apos;s Lady Caroline de Winter , one of his ancestors .
Oh , well , that &apos;s a splendid idea , Mrs. Danvers .
I &apos;m very grateful .
- Everything under control , Frith ?
- Yes , sir , thank you . excuse me , sir , are you supposed to be a schoolmaster ?
Oh , no . this is just my old cap and gown .
it certainly makes a very nice costume , sir . and economical , too .
Yes . that was the idea .
good evening , Robert . not very good weather for the ball .
- No , sir .
- Very misty on the way and very chilly .
Oh , this wig &apos;s so tight they ought to send an aspirin with it .
Hello . what &apos;s the idea ? Adam and Eve ?
Oh , Maxim , don &apos;t be disgusting .
- Strongman .
where &apos;s my weight thing ?
- What thing ?
you haven &apos;t left it in the car , have you ?
there it is . - You were the first one down ? - Yes .
where &apos;s the child ? well , she &apos;s keeping her costume a terrific secret .
wouldn &apos;t even let me into her room .
Oh , lovely .
I &apos;ll go up and give her a hand .
- I could do with a drink .
- Won &apos;t you catch a cold in that thing ?
don &apos;t be silly . pure wool , old boy .
- Pardon me , sir . you forgot this .
- Thank you .
here I am , dear , it &apos;s Bea . I &apos;ve come to give you a hand .
Oh , please don &apos;t come in , Beatrice . I don &apos;t want anyone to see my costume .
Oh . Oh , you won &apos;t be long , will you ?
because the first people will be arriving any moment .
now , you &apos;re sure that &apos;s where that should be ?
Yes , madam , it &apos;s just right .
- Isn &apos;t it exciting ?
- Indeed it is , madam .
I &apos;ve always heard of the Manderley ball , and now I &apos;m really going to see one .
I &apos;m sure there will be no one there to touch you , madam .
do you really think so ? now , where &apos;s my fan ?
here . - You &apos;re sure I look all right ?
- You look ever so beautiful .
well , here goes .
good evening , Mr. De Winter .
what the devil do you think you &apos;re doing ?
Rebecca .
but it &apos;s the picture . the one in the gallery .
- What is it ? what have I done ?
- Go and take it off . it doesn &apos;t matter what you put on . anything will do .
what are you standing there for ? didn &apos;t you hear what I said ?
sir George and Lady Moore .
Dudley Tennant . admiral and Lady Burbank .
I watched you go down , just as I watched her a year ago .
even in the same dress , you couldn &apos;t compare .
you knew it .
you knew that she wore it , and yet you deliberately suggested I wear it .
why do you hate me ?
what have I done to you that you should ever hate me so ?
you tried to take her place , you let him marry you .
I &apos;ve seen his face , his eyes .
they &apos;re the same as those first weeks after she died .
I used to listen to him walking up and down , up and down , all night long , night after night , thinking of her , suffering torture because he &apos;d lost her .
I don &apos;t want to know . I don &apos;t want to know !
you thought you could be Mrs. De Winter , live in her house , walk in her steps , take the things that were hers .
but she &apos;s too strong for you . you can &apos;t fight her .
no one ever got the better of her . never . never .
she was beaten in the end , but it wasn &apos;t a man , it wasn &apos;t a woman .
it was the sea . Oh , stop it .
stop it . Oh , stop it .
you &apos;re overwrought , madam . I &apos;ve opened a window for you .
a little air will do you good .
why don &apos;t you go ? why don &apos;t you leave Manderley ?
he doesn &apos;t need you .
he &apos;s got his memories .
he doesn &apos;t love you . he wants to be alone again with her .
you &apos;ve nothing to stay for .
you &apos;ve nothing to live for , really , have you ?
look down there . it &apos;s easy , isn &apos;t it ?
why don &apos;t you ?
why don &apos;t you ?
go on .
don &apos;t be afraid .
Shipwreck . ship on the rocks !
- A ship aground , sending up rockets !
- Shipwreck ! come on , everybody , down to the bay . notify the coast guard .
she &apos;s aground . Maxim ! Maxim !
ship ashore . come on !
come on , everybody . come on !
come on ! - Maxim ! Maxim !
Oh !
Ben , have you seen Mr. De Winter anywhere ?
she won &apos;t come back , will she ?
you said so .
who , Ben ?
what do you mean ?
the other one .
- Frank , have you seen Maxim anywhere ?
- Not since about half an hour ago . I thought he &apos;d gone up to the house .
no , he hasn &apos;t been in the house at all , and I &apos;m afraid something might have happened to him .
Frank , what &apos;s the matter ? is anything wrong ?
- There is something wrong .
- Well ... The diver who went down to inspect the bottom of the ship came across the hull of another boat .
a little sailboat .
- Frank , is it ... - Yes .
it &apos;s Rebecca &apos;s .
how did they recognize it ?
he &apos;s a local man . knew it instantly .
it &apos;ll be so hard on poor Maxim . Yes .
it &apos;s going to bring it all back again , and worse than before .
why did they have to find it ?
why couldn &apos;t they have left it there in peace at the bottom of the sea ?
well , I &apos;d better get along and arrange some breakfast for the men .
all right , Frank . I &apos;ll go and look for Maxim .
- Hello . - Maxim .
you haven &apos;t had any sleep .
- Have you forgiven me ? - Forgiven you ?
what have I got to forgive you for ?
for last night . my stupidity about the costume .
Oh , that . I &apos;d forgotten .
I was angry with you , wasn &apos;t I ?
Maxim , can &apos;t we start all over again ?
I don &apos;t ask that you should love me . I won &apos;t ask impossible things .
I &apos;ll be your friend , your companion .
I &apos;ll be happy with that .
you love me very much , don &apos;t you ?
but it &apos;s too late , my darling .
we &apos;ve lost our little chance of happiness .
- No , Maxim , no . - Yes .
it &apos;s all over now .
the thing &apos;s happened .
the thing I have dreaded day after day .
- Night after night .
- Maxim , what are you trying to tell me ?
Rebecca has won .
her shadow has been between us all the time , keeping us from one another .
she knew that this would happen .
what are you saying ?
they sent a diver down . - He found another boat .
- Yes , I know . Frank told me . Rebecca &apos;s boat .
Oh , it &apos;s terrible for you . I &apos;m so sorry .
the diver made another discovery .
broke one of the ports and looked into the cabin .
there was a body in there .
she wasn &apos;t alone .
there was someone sailing with her , and you have to find out who it was , that &apos;s it , isn &apos;t it , Maxim ?
you don &apos;t understand . there was no one with her .
it &apos;s Rebecca &apos;s body lying there on the cabin floor .
Oh , no .
the woman that was washed up at Edgecombe , the woman that is now buried in the family crypt ,
that was not Rebecca .
that was the body of some unknown woman , unclaimed , belonging nowhere .
I identified it . but I knew it wasn &apos;t Rebecca .
it was all a lie .
I knew where Rebecca &apos;s body was , lying on that cabin floor on the bottom of the sea .
how did you know , Maxim ?
because I put it there .
will you look into my eyes and tell me that you love me now ?
you see ? I was right .
it &apos;s too late .
no , it &apos;s not too late . you &apos;re not to say that .
I love you more than anything in the world .
- Oh , please , Maxim , kiss me , please .
- No . it &apos;s no use . it &apos;s too late .
Oh , we can &apos;t lose each other now .
we must be together always . no secrets , no shadows .
we may only have a few days , a few hours .
Maxim , why didn &apos;t you tell me before ?
I nearly did sometimes , but you never seemed close enough .
how could we be close when I knew you were always thinking of Rebecca ?
how could I even ask you to love me , when I knew you loved Rebecca still ?
what are you talking about ? what do you mean ?
whenever you touched me , I knew you were comparing me with Rebecca .
whenever you looked at me or spoke to me or walked with me in the garden ,
I knew you were thinking , &quot; This I did with Rebecca , and this , and this . &quot;
Oh , it &apos;s true , isn &apos;t it ?
you thought I loved Rebecca ? you thought that ?
I hated her .
Oh , I was carried away by her , enchanted by her as everyone was .
and when I was married , I was told I was the luckiest man in the world .
she was so lovely , so accomplished , so amusing .
&quot; she &apos;s got the three things that really matter in a wife , &quot; everyone said .
&quot; breeding , brains and beauty . &quot;
and I believed them . completely .
but I never had a moment &apos;s happiness with her .
she was incapable of love or tenderness or decency .
you didn &apos;t love her . you didn &apos;t love her .
do you remember that cliff where you first saw me in Monte Carlo ?
well , I went there with Rebecca on our honeymoon .
that &apos;s where I found out about her , four days after we were married .
she stood there laughing , her black hair blowing in the wind and told me all about herself .
everything .
things I &apos;ll never tell a living soul .
I wanted to kill her .
it would have been so easy . you remember the precipice ?
I frightened you , didn &apos;t I ? you thought I was mad .
perhaps I was . perhaps I am mad .
it wouldn &apos;t make for sanity , would it ? living with the devil ?
&quot; I &apos;ll make a bargain with you , &quot; she said .
&quot; you &apos;d look rather foolish trying to divorce me now after four days of marriage , so I &apos;ll play the part of a devoted wife , mistress of your precious Manderley .
I &apos;ll make it the most famous showplace in England , if you like , and people will visit us and envy us , and say we &apos;re the luckiest , happiest couple in the country .
what a grand joke it &apos;ll be . what a triumph . &quot;
I should never have accepted her dirty bargain , but I did .
I was younger then , and tremendously conscious of the family honor .
family honor .
she knew that I &apos;d sacrifice everything rather than stand up in a divorce court and give her away , admit that our marriage was a rotten fraud .
you despise me , don &apos;t you ? as I despise myself .
you can &apos;t understand what my feelings were , can you ?
of course I can , darling . of course I can .
well , I kept the bargain and so did she , apparently .
Oh , she played the game brilliantly , but after a while , she began to grow careless .
she took a flat in London , and she &apos;d stay away for days at a time .
then she started to bring her friends down here .
I warned her , but she shrugged her shoulders . &quot; what &apos;s it got to do with you ? &quot; she said .
she even started on Frank .
poor , faithful Frank .
then there was a cousin of hers , a man named Favell . Yes .
I know him . he came the day you went to London .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
I didn &apos;t like to . I thought it would remind you of Rebecca .
remind me ? as if I needed reminding .
Favell used to visit her here in this cottage .
I found out about it , and I warned her that if he came here again ,
I &apos;d shoot them both .
one night , when I found she had come back quietly from London ,
I thought that Favell was with her , and I knew then that I couldn &apos;t stand this life of filth and deceit any longer .
I decided to come down here and have it out with both of them .
but she was alone .
she was expecting Favell , but he hadn &apos;t come .
she was lying on the divan , a large tray of cigarette stubs beside her .
she looked ill , queer .
suddenly , she got up , started to walk toward me .
&quot; when I have a child , &quot; she said , &quot; neither you nor anyone else could ever prove it wasn &apos;t yours .
you would like to have an heir , wouldn &apos;t you , Max , for your precious Manderley ? &quot;
then she started to laugh .
&quot; how funny .
how supremely , wonderfully funny .
I &apos;ll be the perfect mother , just as I &apos;ve been the perfect wife .
no one will ever know .
it ought to give you the thrill of your life , Max , to watch my son grow bigger day by day and to know that when you die , Manderley will be his . &quot;
she was face to face with me .
one hand in her pocket , the other holding a cigarette .
she was smiling .
&quot; well , Max ? what are you going to do about it ?
aren &apos;t you going to kill me ? &quot;
I suppose I went mad for a moment .
I must have struck her .
she stood staring at me .
she looked almost triumphant .
then she started toward me again . smiling .
suddenly , she stumbled and fell .
when I looked down , ages afterwards , it seemed , she was lying on the floor .
she had struck her head on a heavy piece of ship &apos;s tackle .
I remember wondering why she was still smiling .
then I realized she was dead .
but you didn &apos;t kill her . it was an accident .
who would believe me ? I lost my head .
I just knew I had to do something . anything .
I carried her out to the boat .
it was very dark . there was no moon .
I put her in the cabin .
when the boat seemed a safe distance from the shore , I took a spike , and drove it again and again through the planking of the hull .
I had opened up the seacocks and the water began to come in fast .
I climbed over into the dinghy and pulled away .
I saw the boat heel over and sink .
I pulled back into the cove .
it started raining .
- Maxim , does anyone else know of this ? - No .
no one except you and me .
we must explain it .
it &apos;s got to be the body of someone you &apos;ve never seen before .
no , they &apos;re bound to know her .
her rings , bracelets she always wore .
they &apos;ll identify her body , then they &apos;ll remember the other woman .
the other woman buried in the crypt .
if they find out it was Rebecca , you must simply say you made a mistake about the other body .
that the day you went to Edgecombe , you were ill , you didn &apos;t know what you were doing .
Rebecca &apos;s dead . that &apos;s what we &apos;ve got to remember . Rebecca &apos;s dead .
she can &apos;t speak . she can &apos;t bear witness .
she can &apos;t harm you anymore .
we &apos;re the only two people in the world that know , Maxim , you and I .
I &apos;d told you once that I &apos;d done a selfish thing in marrying you .
you can understand now what I meant .
I &apos;ve loved you , my darling .
I shall always love you , but I &apos;ve known all along that Rebecca would win in the end .
no , no . she hasn &apos;t won .
no matter what happens now , she hasn &apos;t won .
Hello ?
Hello , Frank . Hello , Frank . Yes .
who ? Colonel Julyan ? Yes .
tell him I &apos;ll meet him there as soon as I possibly can .
what ? well ...
say we could talk about that when we &apos;re sure about the matter .
what &apos;s happened ?
Colonel Julyan called . he &apos;s the chief constable of the county .
he &apos;s been asked by the police to go to the mortuary .
he wanted to know if I could possibly have made a mistake about that other body .
well , Colonel Julyan , apparently I did make a mistake about that other body .
the mistake was natural under the circumstances . - Besides , you weren &apos;t well at the time .
- That &apos;s nonsense .
I was perfectly well .
don &apos;t let it worry you , Maxim .
nobody can blame you for making a mistake .
the pity is , you &apos;ve got to go through the same thing all over again . what do you mean ?
there &apos;ll have to be another inquest , of course .
same formality and red tape .
wish you could be spared the publicity of it , but I &apos;m afraid that &apos;s impossible .
Oh , yes , publicity .
I suppose Mrs. De Winter went below for something and a squall hit the boat with nobody at the helm .
I imagine that &apos;s about the solution now , don &apos;t you think so , Crawley ? Oh , yes .
probably the door jammed , and she couldn &apos;t get on deck again . Yeah .
Tabb , the boat builder , will undoubtedly come to some such conclusion .
why , what would he know about it ?
well , he &apos;s examining the boat now .
purely as a matter of routine , you know .
I &apos;ll be at the inquest tomorrow , Maxim , quite unofficially , you know .
we must get together for a game of golf when it &apos;s all over , eh ? Bye-bye .
I have the evening papers , madam . would you care to see them ?
Oh , no thank you , Frith , and I prefer that Mr. De Winter weren &apos;t troubled with them , either .
permit me to say that we &apos;re all most distressed outside .
thank you , Frith .
I &apos;m afraid the news has been a great shock to Mrs. Danvers .
Yes , I rather expected it would be .
it seems there &apos;s to be a coroner &apos;s inquest , madam ? Yes , Frith .
it &apos;s purely a formality .
of course , madam . I ...
I wanted to say that if any of us might be required to give evidence ,
I should be only too pleased to do anything that might help the family .
Oh , thank you , Frith , why , I ...
I &apos;m sure Mr. De Winter will be very happy to hear it .
but I don &apos;t think anything will be necessary .
Maxim .
Hello , darling .
Oh , Maxim , I &apos;m worried about what you &apos;ll do at the inquest tomorrow .
what do you mean ?
you won &apos;t lose your temper , will you ?
promise me that they won &apos;t make you angry .
all right , darling . I promise .
no matter what he asks you , you won &apos;t lose your head ?
don &apos;t worry , dear .
they can &apos;t do anything at once , can they ? no .
then we &apos;ve a little time left to be together . Yes .
- I want to go to the inquest with you .
- I &apos;d rather you didn &apos;t , darling .
but I can &apos;t wait here alone .
I promise you , I won &apos;t be any trouble to you .
and I must be near you so that no matter what happens , we won &apos;t be separated for a moment .
all right , dear .
I don &apos;t mind this whole thing except for you .
I can &apos;t forget what it &apos;s done to you .
I &apos;ve been thinking of nothing else since it happened .
it &apos;s gone forever , that funny , young , lost look I loved .
it won &apos;t ever come back .
I killed that when I told you about Rebecca .
it &apos;s gone .
in a few hours , you &apos;ve grown so much older .
Oh , Maxim , Maxim .
black Jack Brady was his name .
the most important arrest I ever made .
it must have been about two years ago now .
of course , there was no doubt about it .
he was hung a month after I caught him . Hello . wait a minute .
they &apos;ve got old Balmy Ben up now .
you remember the late Mrs. De Winter , don &apos;t you ? - She &apos;s gone .
- Yes , we know that .
- She went in the sea .
the sea got her . - That &apos;s right .
that &apos;s right . now we want you to tell us whether you were on the shore
- that last night she went sailing . - Eh ?
were you on the shore that last night she went out , when she didn &apos;t come back ?
I didn &apos;t see nothing . I don &apos;t want to go to the asylum .
them cruel folks there .
now , nobody &apos;s going to send you to the asylum .
all we want you to do is tell us what you saw .
I didn &apos;t see nothing .
come , come . did you see Mrs. De Winter get into her boat that last night ?
I don &apos;t know nothing . I don &apos;t want to go to the asylum .
very well . you may go . - Eh ?
- You may go now . - Mr. Tabb , step forward , please .
- Yes ?
the evidence you give will be the truth , the whole truth and nothing but the truth , so help you God ?
I do , so help me God .
the late Mrs. De Winter used to send her boat
- to your shipyard for reconditioning .
- That &apos;s right , sir .
can you remember any occasion when she had any sort of accident with the boat ?
I often said Mrs. De Winter was a born sailor .
now , when Mrs. De Winter went below , as is supposed , and a sudden gust of wind came down , that would be enough to capsize the boat , wouldn &apos;t it ?
excuse me , sir . but there &apos;s a little more to it than that .
- What do you mean , Mr. Tabb ?
- I mean , sir , the seacocks .
what are the seacocks ?
sea ...
the seacocks are the valves to drain out the boat .
they &apos;re always kept tight closed when you &apos;re afloat . Yes ?
well , yesterday , when I examined that boat , I found they &apos;d been opened .
what could be the reason for that ?
just this , that &apos;s what flooded the boat and sunk her .
are you implying that boat never capsized at all ?
I know it &apos;s a terrible thing to say , sir , but in my opinion , she was scuttled .
- And there &apos;s them holes .
- What holes ? - In her planking .
- What are you talking about ?
of course , that boat &apos;s been underwater for over a year , and the tide &apos;s been knocking her against the ridge .
but it seemed to me them holes looked as if she &apos;d made them from the inside .
then you believe she must have done it deliberately .
couldn &apos;t have been no accident , not with her knowledge of boats .
you knew the former Mrs. De Winter very well , I believe ? Oh , yes .
would you have believed her capable of suicide ?
no . frankly , I would not .
but you never can tell .
you may stand down , Mr. Tabb .
Mr. De Winter , please .
sorry to drag you back for further questioning , Mr. De Winter . but you &apos;ve heard the statement of Mr. Tabb .
I wonder if you can help us in any way .
I &apos;m afraid not .
can you think of any reason why there should be holes in the planking of the late Mrs. De Winter &apos;s boat ?
well , of course I can &apos;t think of any reason .
has anyone ever discussed these holes with you before ? well , since the boat has been at the bottom of the ocean ,
I scarcely think that likely .
Mr. De Winter , I want you to believe we all feel very deeply for you in this matter .
but you must remember that I don &apos;t conduct this inquiry for my own amusement .
- That &apos;s rather obvious , isn &apos;t it ?
- I hope that it is .
well , since she went sailing alone , are we to believe that she drove those holes herself ?
you may believe what you like .
can you enlighten us as to why Mrs. De Winter should have wanted to end her own life ?
I know of no reason whatever .
Mr. De Winter , however painful it may be ,
I have to ask you a very personal question .
were relations between you and the late Mrs. De Winter perfectly happy ?
I won &apos;t stand this any longer ! you might as well know now ...
we &apos;ll adjourn till after lunch .
Mr. De Winter , I presume you &apos;ll be available for us then ?
I told you , you should have had some breakfast .
you &apos;re hungry . that &apos;s what &apos;s the matter with you .
Mr. Frith thought you might like to have some lunch from the house , and sent me with it .
no , that &apos;s fine . pull around the corner .
very good , sir .
awfully foolish of me , fainting like that . nonsense .
if you hadn &apos;t fainted like that , I &apos;d have really lost my temper .
darling , please be careful .
darling , wait here a few moments .
I &apos;ll see if I can find old Frank . of course , darling .
don &apos;t worry about me .
I &apos;ll be all right . sure ?
here , try a spot of this .
thank you .
- Are you all right ? - Yes , of course .
- I won &apos;t be long .
- Right you are .
and how does the bride find herself today ?
I say , marriage with Max is not exactly a bed of roses , is it ?
I think you &apos;d better go before Maxim gets back . Oh , jealous , is he ?
well , I can &apos;t say I blame him .
but you don &apos;t think I &apos;m the big bad wolf , do you ?
I &apos;m not , you know . I &apos;m a perfectly ordinary , harmless bloke .
and I think you &apos;re behaving splendidly over all this .
perfectly splendidly .
you know , you &apos;ve grown up a bit since I last saw you .
it &apos;s no wonder ...
what do you want , Favell ?
Oh , hello , Max . things are going pretty well for you , aren &apos;t they ?
better than you ever expected .
I was rather worried about you at first .
that &apos;s why I came down to the inquest . well , I &apos;m touched by your solicitude .
but if you don &apos;t mind , we &apos;d rather like to have our lunch .
lunch ? I say , what a jolly idea . rather like a picnic , isn &apos;t it ?
I &apos;m so sorry . do you mind if I put this there ?
you know , Max , old boy , I really think I ought to talk things over with you .
talk what things over ?
well , those holes in the planking , for one thing .
those holes that were drilled from the inside .
- Oh , Mullen ?
- Yes , sir ?
would you , like a good fellow , have my car filled with petrol ?
- It &apos;s almost empty . - Very good , sir .
- And , Mullen , close the door , will you ?
does this bother you ?
you know , old boy , I have a strong feeling that before the day &apos;s out , somebody &apos;s going to make use of that rather expressive , though somewhat old-fashioned term , &quot; foul play . &quot;
am I boring you with all this ?
no ? good .
well , you see , Max , I find myself in a rather awkward position .
you &apos;ve only got to read this note to understand . it &apos;s from Rebecca .
and , what &apos;s more , she had the foresight to put a date on it .
she wrote me the day she died .
Incidentally , I was at a party on that night so I didn &apos;t get it until the next day .
and what makes you think that note would interest me ?
Oh , I &apos;m not gonna bother you with the contents now .
but I can assure you that it is not the note of a woman who intends to drown herself that same night .
by the way , what do you do with old bones ?
bury them ?
however , for the time being ...
you know , Max , I &apos;m getting fed up with my job as a motorcar salesman .
I don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve ever experienced the feeling of driving an expensive motorcar which isn &apos;t your own ?
but it can be very , very exasperating .
you know what I mean . you want to own the car yourself .
I often wonder what it would be like to retire to the country .
have a nice little place with a few acres of shooting .
I &apos;ve never figured out what it would cost a year , but I &apos;d like to talk about it with you .
I &apos;d like to have your advice on how to live comfortably without hard work .
Hello , Favell . you looking for me , Maxim ?
Yes . Mr. Favell and I have a little business transaction on hand .
I think we had better conduct it over at the inn .
they may have a private room there .
well , see you later .
find Colonel Julyan . tell him I want to see him immediately .
come on , Favell . let &apos;s go .
- Have you a private room , please ?
- Of course , sir . through there , sir .
hope this will do , Mr. De Winter .
splendid . splendid . exactly like the Ritz .
any orders , gents ? Yes .
you might bring me a large brandy and soda .
how about you , Max ? have one on me . I feel I can afford to play host .
thanks . I don &apos;t mind if I do .
make it two , will you , like a good fellow ?
- Very good , sir .
where &apos;s Mr. De Winter ?
through the other door , sir .
Colonel Julyan , this is Mr. Favell .
Oh , I know Colonel Julyan . we &apos;re old friends , aren &apos;t we ?
since you &apos;re old friends , I assume you also know he &apos;s head of the police here .
he might be interested to hear your proposition . tell him all about it .
I don &apos;t know what you mean .
I merely said I hoped to give up selling cars and retire into the country .
actually , he offered to withhold a vital piece of evidence from the inquest if I made it worth his while .
I only want to see justice done , Colonel .
now , that boat builder &apos;s evidence suggested certain possible theories concerning Rebecca &apos;s death .
one of them , of course , is suicide .
now I have a little note here which I consider puts that possibility quite out of court .
read it , Colonel .
&quot; Jack , darling ,
I &apos;ve just seen the doctor and I &apos;m going down to Manderley right away .
I shall be at the cottage all this evening and shall leave the door open for you .
I have something terribly important to tell you . Rebecca . &quot;
now , does that look like the note of a woman who had made up her mind to kill herself ?
and apart from that , do you mean to tell me that if you wanted to commit suicide , you would go to all the trouble of putting out to sea in a boat , and then take a hammer and chisel
and laboriously knock holes through the bottom of it ?
come , Colonel .
as an officer of the law , don &apos;t you feel there are some slight grounds for suspicion ?
- Of murder ? - What else ?
you &apos;ve known Max a long time .
so you know he &apos;s the old-fashioned type , who &apos;d die to defend his honor , or who &apos;d kill for it .
it &apos;s blackmail , pure and simple .
and the blackmailer sometimes finds himself in jail at the end of it . Oh , I see .
you &apos;re going to hold de Winter &apos;s hand through all this .
just because he &apos;s the big noise around here and he &apos;s actually permitted you to dine with him .
be careful , Favell . you &apos;ve brought an accusation of murder .
- Have you any witnesses ?
- I do have a witness .
it &apos;s that fellow , Ben .
if that stupid coroner hadn &apos;t been as much of a snob as you are , he &apos;d have seen that half-wit was hiding something .
and why should Ben do that ?
because we caught him once , Rebecca and I , peering at us through the cottage window .
Rebecca threatened him with the asylum . that &apos;s why he was afraid to speak .
but he was always hanging about . he must have seen this whole thing .
it &apos;s ridiculous , even listening to all this .
you &apos;re like a little trade union , all of you , aren &apos;t you ?
and if my guess is right , Crawley , there &apos;s a bit of malice in your soul toward me , isn &apos;t there ?
Crawley didn &apos;t have much success with Rebecca , but he ought to have more luck this time .
and the bride will be grateful for your fraternal arm , Crawley , in a week or so .
every time she faints , in fact .
- De Winter !
- Maxim , please !
that temper of yours will do you in yet , Max .
excuse me , gentlemen . - Now is there anything else ?
- Yes . you might bring Mr. De Winter a sedative .
- No , no . nothing at all . just leave us .
- Very good .
now , Favell , let &apos;s get this business over .
as you seem to have worked out the whole thing so carefully , perhaps you can provide us also with a motive .
I knew you were going to bring that up , Colonel .
I &apos;ve read enough detective stories to know that there must always be a motive .
and if you &apos;ll all excuse me , I might supply that , too .
I wish you &apos;d go home . you ought not to be here through all this .
please let me stay , Maxim .
surely , Colonel Julyan , you &apos;re not going to allow this fellow to ...
my opinion of Favell is no higher than yours , Crawley .
but in my official capacity , I have no alternative but to pursue his accusations .
I entirely agree with you , Colonel .
in matters as serious as this , we must make sure of every point and explore every avenue .
and in fact , if I may coin a phrase , leave no stone unturned .
here she is , the missing link , the witness who will help supply the motive .
Colonel Julyan , Mrs. Danvers . I believe you know everyone else .
won &apos;t you sit down ?
no offense , Colonel , but I think I &apos;ll put this to Danny .
she &apos;ll understand it more easily . Danny , who was Rebecca &apos;s doctor ?
Mrs. De Winter always had Dr. McClean from the village .
now , you heard . I said Rebecca &apos;s doctor in London .
I don &apos;t know anything about that .
Oh , don &apos;t give me that , Danny . you knew everything about Rebecca .
you knew she was in love with me , didn &apos;t you ?
surely you haven &apos;t forgotten the good times she and I used to have down at the cottage on the beach .
she had a right to amuse herself , didn &apos;t she ?
love was a game to her . only a game . it made her laugh , I tell you .
she used to sit and rock with laughter at the lot of you .
can you think of why Mrs. De Winter should have taken her own life ?
no , no . I refuse to believe it .
I knew everything about her and I won &apos;t believe it . there .
you see ? it &apos;s impossible . she knows that as well as I do .
now , listen to me , Danny . we know that Rebecca went to a doctor in London on the last day of her life .
who was it ?
I don &apos;t know .
I understand , Danny .
you think we &apos;re asking you to reveal secrets of Rebecca &apos;s life .
you &apos;re trying to defend her . but that &apos;s what I &apos;m doing .
I &apos;m trying to clear her name of the suspicion of suicide .
Mrs. Danvers , it has been suggested that Mrs. De Winter was deliberately murdered .
there you have it in a nutshell , Danny .
but there &apos;s one more thing you &apos;ll want to know , the name of the murderer .
it &apos;s a lovely name that rolls off the tongue so easily .
George Fortescue Maximilian de Winter .
there was a doctor . Mrs. De Winter sometimes went to him privately .
she used to go to him even before she was married .
we don &apos;t want reminiscences , Danny .
Dr. Baker . 165 Goldhawk Road , Shepherd &apos;s Bush .
there you are , Colonel . there &apos;s where you &apos;ll find your motive .
go and question Dr. Baker . he &apos;ll tell you why Rebecca went to him .
to confirm the fact that she was going to have a child .
a sweet , curly-headed little child .
it isn &apos;t true . it isn &apos;t true . she would have told me .
she told Max about it . Max knew he wasn &apos;t the father .
so , like the gentleman of the old school that he is , he killed her .
I &apos;m afraid we shall have to question this Dr. Baker .
hear , hear . but for safety &apos;s sake , I think I &apos;d like to go along , too .
Yes . unfortunately , I suppose you have the right to ask that .
I &apos;ll see the coroner and have the inquest postponed pending further evidence .
I say , aren &apos;t you rather afraid that the prisoner , shall we say , might bolt ?
you have my word for it that he will not do that .
toodle-oo , Max . come along , Danny .
let &apos;s leave the unhappy couple to spend their last moments together alone .
are you sure you don &apos;t want me to go with you , Max ?
no , darling . it &apos;ll be very tiring for you .
I &apos;ll be back the very first thing in the morning .
- And I won &apos;t even stop to sleep .
- I &apos;ll be waiting for you .
- Ready , Maxim ?
- Yes .
you two go on ahead . I &apos;ll follow with Favell .
Dr. Baker , you may have seen
Mr. De Winter &apos;s name in the papers recently .
Yes . Yes . in connection with the body that was found in a boat .
my wife was reading all about it . a very sad case . my condolences .
this is going to take hours .
don &apos;t bother , Favell . I think I can tell Dr. Baker .
we &apos;re trying to discover certain facts concerning the late Mrs. De Winter &apos;s activities on the day of her death .
October the 12th , last year .
I want you to tell me if you can , if anyone of that name paid you a visit on that date ?
I &apos;m awfully sorry . I &apos;m afraid I can &apos;t help you .
I should have remembered the name de Winter .
I &apos;ve never attended a Mrs. De Winter in my life .
how can you possibly tell all your patients &apos; names ?
I can look it up in my engagement diary if you like .
- Did you say the 12th of October ?
Yes .
here we are . no . no de Winter .
are you sure ?
well , here are all the appointments for that day .
Ross , Campbell , Steadall , Perrino , Danvers ...
- Danny ? what the devil ?
- Would you read that name again ? did you say Danvers ?
Yes . I have a Mrs. Danvers for 3 : 00 .
what did she look like ? can you remember ?
Yes , I remember her quite well . she was a very beautiful woman .
- Tall , dark , exquisitely dressed .
Rebecca .
the lady must have used an assumed name .
is that so ? this is a surprise . I &apos;ve known her a long time .
what was the matter with her ?
well , there are certain ethics .
could you supply a reason , Dr. Baker , for Mrs. De Winter &apos;s suicide ?
for her murder , you mean ? she was going to have a kid , wasn &apos;t she ?
come on . out with it !
tell me , what else would a woman of her class be doing in a dump like this ?
I take it the official nature of this visit makes it necessary for me to ...
I assure you we &apos;d not be troubling you if it were not necessary .
you want to know if I can suggest any motive as to why Mrs. De Winter should have taken her life ?
Yes , I think I can .
the woman who called herself Mrs. Danvers was very seriously ill .
she was not going to have a child ?
that was what she thought . my diagnosis was different .
I sent her to a well-known specialist for an examination and x-rays .
and on this date , she returned to me for his report .
I remember her standing here holding out her hand for the photograph .
&quot; I want to know the truth , &quot; she said .
&quot; I don &apos;t want soft words and a bedside manner .
if I &apos;m for it , you can tell me right away . &quot;
I knew she was not the type to accept a lie .
she &apos;d asked for the truth , so I let her have it .
she thanked me . I never saw her again , so I assumed ...
- What was wrong with her ?
- Cancer .
Yes , the growth was deep-rooted .
an operation would have been no earthly use at all .
in a short time , she would have been under morphia .
there was nothing that could be done for her , except wait .
did she say anything when you told her ?
she smiled in a queer sort of way .
your wife was a wonderful woman , Mr. De Winter .
and , oh , yes , I remember she said something that struck me as being very peculiar at the time .
when I told her it was a matter of months , she said ,
&quot; Oh , no , Doctor , not that long . &quot;
you &apos;ve been very kind . you &apos;ve told us all we wanted to know .
we shall need an official verification .
- Verification ?
- Yes . - To confirm the verdict of suicide .
I understand . can I offer you gentlemen a glass of sherry ?
no , that &apos;s very kind . I think we ought to be going .
thank heaven we know the truth .
dreadful thing . dreadful .
young and lovely woman like that . no wonder ...
I never had the remotest idea . neither did Danny , I &apos;m sure .
I wish I had a drink .
will we be needed at the inquest any further , Colonel Julyan ? no , no .
I can see to it that Maxim &apos;s not troubled any further . - Thank you , sir .
- You ready to start , Colonel ?
no , thank you .
I &apos;m staying in town tonight .
and let me tell you , Favell , blackmail is not much of a profession .
and we know how to deal with it in our part of the world , strange as it may seem to you .
I &apos;m sure I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
but if you ever need a new car , Colonel , just let me know .
it &apos;s impossible to thank you for your kindness to us through all this .
you know what I feel without my saying it . not at all .
put the whole thing behind you .
but let your wife know . she &apos;ll be getting worried . Yes , of course .
I &apos;ll phone her at once and we &apos;ll get straight down to Manderley . Goodbye , Crawley .
Maxim &apos;s got a great friend .
- Frank .
- Yes , Maxim ?
- There &apos;s something you don &apos;t know .
- Oh , no , there isn &apos;t .
I didn &apos;t kill her , Frank .
but I know now that when she told me about the child , she wanted me to kill her .
she lied on purpose . she foresaw the whole thing .
that &apos;s why she stood there laughing when she ...
don &apos;t think about it anymore .
thank you , Frank .
Hello , Danny . I just wanted to tell you the news .
Rebecca held out on both of us . she had cancer .
Yes , suicide .
now Max and that dear little bride of his will be able to stay on at Manderley and live happily ever after .
Bye-bye , Danny .
- This your car , sir ?
- Yes .
will you be going soon ? this isn &apos;t a parking place , you know . Oh , isn &apos;t it ?
well , people are entitled to leave cars outside if they want to .
it &apos;s a pity some of you fellows haven &apos;t anything better to do .
when you phoned , did she say she &apos;d wait up ?
I asked her to go to bed , but she wouldn &apos;t hear of it .
I wish I could get some more speed out of this thing .
is something worrying you , Maxim ?
I can &apos;t get over the feeling something &apos;s wrong .
- Frank . - What &apos;s the matter ?
why did we stop ?
what &apos;s the time ? well , this clock &apos;s wrong .
it must be 3 : 00 or 4 : 00 . why ?
that can &apos;t be the dawn breaking over there .
it &apos;s in the winter that you see the northern lights , isn &apos;t it ?
that &apos;s not the northern lights . that &apos;s Manderley .
Frith ! Frith ! Mrs. De Winter .
- I thought I saw her , sir . - Where ?
Maxim !
thank heavens you &apos;ve come back to me !
- Are you all right , darling ? - Oh , yes , I am . are you all right ?
Mrs. Danvers , she &apos;s gone mad .
she said she &apos;d rather destroy Manderley than see us happy here .
look ! the west wing !
all right , Verne .
did you hear me ?
I said , come out .
thirty days in solitary won &apos;t make him any easier to handle .
don &apos;t try anything , Verne , or you &apos;ll go back in there .
look him over .
he may have a knife .
Yeah .
maybe one of them rats in there slipped me one .
but I got a couple of hidden weapons at that , here and here .
- Nobody can take them away from me .
- Come on .
Ninety lashes , 16 months in solitary , seven months in the bear pit and five attempts to escape in three years .
- Don &apos;t you like it here , Verne ?
- No .
does that answer it ?
you put things so clearly .
maybe we ought to give you a chance to make some new contacts , outside the walls .
- Outside ?
- Why not ?
nature surrounded us with something stronger than walls , the jungle .
you know about that don &apos;t you , Verne ?
so it &apos;s tough .
you &apos;ve plugged up every hole I &apos;ve ever made , but you know I &apos;m going to make another one .
Yeah , I &apos;ve heard men talk like that before .
men like Moussenq .
six times he got away .
three times we caught him , and three times the jungle got him for us .
you can &apos;t win , Verne .
and why try , when you &apos;ve only got three years left ?
I &apos;d try if I only had three minutes left .
I &apos;m a thief by profession , Grideau , not a convict .
there &apos;s nothing won &apos;th stealing around here except freedom , and I &apos;m after some of that .
Verne , I &apos;m going to assign you to the wharf detail outside the walls .
frankly , it &apos;s an experiment .
I &apos;ve tried everything else with you .
you &apos;ll be on your honor .
I haven &apos;t got any .
don &apos;t be a sucker .
Yes , well go and clean yourself up .
report for work at the main gate .
Oh , Verne .
I forgot to tell you , there were three or four men , big men like you , who did make it through the jungle .
except when they got through , I was waiting for them to bring them back .
28 , 30 , 32 , 34 , 36 . 36 , right ?
36 , right .
looks like you &apos;ve had enough , Pop .
Twelve years seems like enough .
more than enough .
get up , Moussenq .
this is no picnic .
did he call you Moussenq ?
that &apos;s my name .
that &apos;s all Moussenq is now , a name .
you called me Pop .
how old do you think I am ?
you look about 50 .
I &apos;m 36 years old , believe it if you can .
Twelve of them I spent in the bear pit and solitary and under the lash .
you &apos;ve made enough breaks .
why didn &apos;t you get away ?
no man can get through that jungle .
it tears you and breaks you and makes you old before your time .
there &apos;s nothing a man can &apos;t get through to be free .
it &apos;s been done .
with help from the outside , a boat waiting down the coast , maybe .
who knows ?
some way they did it , but not alone .
no , monsieur , it can &apos;t be done .
but someday I &apos;ll try it again .
Verne .
drop it and get moving .
Hello , Georges .
you &apos;ve been such a stranger at the café lately .
well , you know how it is with a newly married man .
- He feels kind of married , you know ?
- Well , in a couple of months , then .
- May I go aboard ?
- What for ?
let &apos;s say I &apos;m a fool for boats , and I only see one every three months .
well , maybe you expect something from home ?
- In care of the captain .
- Well , I &apos;ll take you to him .
coming , Julie ?
there might be some mail .
mail for me ?
- Hello , Julie .
- Go away , Pig .
Oh , Julie , you don &apos;t mean it just like that , do you ?
after all , there is no harm in being friendly .
men die all the time and pigs live on and on , when you &apos;d think their own smell would kill them .
look , how many times have I got to tell you ?
you &apos;re a pig , a sneak and a dirty stoolpigeon , and I want you to leave me alone .
watch yourself , baby .
just act natural like you &apos;re alone .
- What do you want ?
- Guess .
why , you crummy convict .
who do you think you &apos;re talking to ?
wait a minute , sweetheart .
made a nice grab there , didn &apos;t I ?
let go , or I &apos;ll yell for the guard .
be nice , or I &apos;ll give it a twist .
and they &apos;ll fish you out of the drink .
don &apos;t you know what &apos;ll happen if you &apos;re caught talking to me ?
sure .
they &apos;ll throw me into solitary .
can we fix it to be thrown in together ?
you &apos;d like to cut yourself a piece of cake like that , wouldn &apos;t you ?
easy , baby .
listen , if I &apos;m caught talking to a convict , they &apos;ll chase me off the island .
swell .
we &apos;ll meet on the mainland , and hit Paris together .
you &apos;re from Paris , ain &apos;t you ?
I said , where you from , baby ?
- Marseille .
- Marseille .
hot blue nights , the right kind of music , it &apos;s a date .
a romantic convict .
what are you in for , stealing doilies ?
all right , I got no time to mess around .
you &apos;re one of the girls at the café , ain &apos;t you ?
- Ain &apos;t you ?
- Well , what if I am ?
I &apos;ll be there tonight .
keep a light in the window , and a couple more in your eyes .
tonight you &apos;ll be in a cell just where you belong .
and if the walls fall down or something , and you should get out ,
I &apos;ll turn you over to the guards so quick it &apos;ll make you dizzy .
you hate hard , baby , so you love hard .
what &apos;s your name ?
Yvonne , Missy , Julie , Fifi ?
Julie .
I &apos;ll see you tonight , Julie .
don &apos;t tell me the heat &apos;s got you .
I &apos;d swear I saw you talking to yourself .
you werert talking to a convict ?
I know better than that .
I was just trying out some new answers .
I &apos;d like to hear some new ones .
why don &apos;t you drop up some night after you &apos;ve tucked the convicts in the cells ?
you lock them up , don &apos;t you ?
I mean , there &apos;s no way they can get out at night , is there ?
- No way that they know about .
why ?
- Nothing .
I was just wondering .
30 , 32 , 34 , 35 .
Halt .
Louis , there should be 36 .
I count 35 .
hurry up there , get up here with the others .
I must have fallen behind .
there was so much to do out there .
get in line and hurry up about it .
all right , Louis , 36 is right .
take them away .
march .
- I said I &apos;d be here , baby .
- Yes , so you did .
and here you are , and you &apos;re quite a little man .
now beat it before you get yourself a lot of grief .
grief ain &apos;t what I came after .
you got class , kid .
or is it because I haven &apos;t seen any women lately ?
don &apos;t try that again .
because if you do , I &apos;ll break a couple of your bones , if you &apos;ve got any .
let &apos;s see if you have .
now get smart .
why don &apos;t you get smart ?
you know what they &apos;ll do to you .
sure I do , but I &apos;ll take all they &apos;ve got for a little of this .
I don &apos;t know what you &apos;ll look like tomorrow , but right now , baby , you &apos;re the most beautiful dame in the world .
- Does that mean anything to you ?
- Not a thing .
no ?
supposing I wasrt a convict ?
supposing I was sailing through on my yacht or a guy selling brushes ...
Yeah , and suppose I was Snow White .
but even if I did think you werert the worst-looking guy in the world , supposing even I told you you looked like someone I was once dumb enough to go for , what would it get me ?
if you get caught here , I get sent back to the mainland .
I can think of worse things than that .
look , this isn &apos;t my idea of heaven , either .
let &apos;s get back to supposing .
supposing I was the guy you were dumb enough to fall for .
- Then what ?
- Here &apos;s what .
there , you see ?
maybe you wouldn &apos;t be so hard to like if you went at things in a nicer way .
it &apos;d be a nice gamble if a guy could win , wouldn &apos;t it ?
all right , we &apos;ll try things your way .
where do we begin ?
well , I &apos;ve got a number coming up , and a date with one of the prison directors .
and he should be downstairs now .
Yeah , but I &apos;ll tell him I &apos;ve got a headache or something .
take off your beard , sweetheart .
okay .
if you want him to find you here , it &apos;s no skin off my teeth .
that &apos;s right .
so when they start yelling for me to come down and sing my song , I &apos;ll ...
you &apos;ll stay here and sing it .
sure , sure , what do we care ?
we &apos;ll take what we &apos;ve got right now .
who cares about later ?
let them come and get you .
you &apos;re too tough
- and too smart for them all .
- I &apos;m not exactly a cluck , baby .
no , you figure here we are , this is the beginning and the end .
only a cluck would think of tomorrow .
well , I &apos;m a cluck .
you &apos;re no good to me in a cell .
I &apos;m going down to stall them off .
you wait here .
it &apos;s nice of you to try things my way .
- But , monsieur , I assure you ...
- He &apos;s here some place .
there must be some mistake .
no prisoner would dare come in here .
he was seen climbing in an upstairs window .
you .
we &apos;re looking for ...
if you &apos;re looking for a loose convict , come and get him .
all right , Verne , we &apos;ve got you .
don &apos;t try anything .
so , you outsmarted me , huh ?
that &apos;s what happens , they tell me , when smart people get together .
one of them winds up ahead .
and I lose .
only what happens when I catch up with you ?
and I will catch up with you , baby .
the law here denies convicts the privilege of associating with women .
the same law applies to women .
women are not allowed to associate with convicts , on the penalty of expulsion from the colony .
don &apos;t tell me I &apos;m going to be kicked out of this paradise of yours .
all right , come on , give me my ticket .
I &apos;ll be on my way .
well , we don &apos;t give out tickets .
Oh , what do you expect me to do , ride out of here on a cloud ?
make it a cloud for two , baby .
we didn &apos;t send for you .
you can get out the way you got in .
but , Grideau , it wasrt my fault .
he spoke to me on the dock , and I warned him to keep away from me .
when he didn &apos;t , I told him I &apos;d call the guard , and he said if I did , he &apos;d throw me overboard .
how about that , Verne ?
some women would rather drown than talk to a guy like me .
- How did you come to be in her room ?
- I told her I &apos;d be there , didn &apos;t I ?
why didn &apos;t she turn me in before I made good ?
because I didn &apos;t believe he would .
he broke into my room , and as soon as I could , I called the guards .
they &apos;ll tell you .
go on , tell him .
so , she ran into the boys .
she was in a spot .
she turned me in to save her own hide .
you &apos;re a liar .
you &apos;re not going to take the word
- of a slimy convict against mine , are you ?
- I might .
but the facts speak more convincingly than either of you .
he was found in your room .
I &apos;ve got to act accordingly .
okay .
so that &apos;s that , and I &apos;m on my way .
but no matter where I go , or no matter how low it is ,
I &apos;ll know that you &apos;re no better than me , Monsieur Grideau , or any of the rats in your zoo .
you said you &apos;d catch up with me someday .
well , I just hope you do .
- And what &apos;s going to happen then , baby ?
- Here &apos;s what .
take Verne to a dormitory .
I &apos;ll deal with him in the morning .
you &apos;ve got 12 hours to leave the colony .
if you &apos;re not gone , you &apos;ll be put under arrest .
I got an idea , Grideau .
give me 12 hours to get out , and put her in the dormitory .
that way everybody &apos;s happy .
let go of me .
you heard what he said .
I &apos;m going out the way I came in .
- Send the Pig in .
Yes , sir .
thank you , monsieur .
but I wonder whether this time instead of paying me the reward , you would grant me a small favor ?
well , what is it ?
well , Julie &apos;s not a bad girl .
this business was none of her fault .
and will I let her remain in the colony ?
and what makes you think I deal in women , you miserable ...
take your money and get out of here .
Wouldrt have to rely on vermin like him if you men filled your uniforms .
have you discovered how Verne managed to remain outside the walls ?
there &apos;s no way of explaining it , sir .
36 men were counted through the gate , and 36 men were counted back , and double counted , sir .
well , if you &apos;re sure of that , then , it certainly is odd .
isn &apos;t that the Bible you &apos;re reading ?
with the exception of me , this room is filled with men who have forgotten God .
Blasphemers , infidels , atheists .
and God , too , has forgotten them all .
all except me .
I will be forgiven for my sins .
the rest will burn in hell , but I will be forgiven .
- So , that &apos;s why you read the Bible ?
- Why else ?
- There might be many other reasons .
- And there might be none at all .
look at this pathetic little worm , lulling the ache of his conscience with spiritual aspirin .
I can &apos;t think of anything more practical than removing that particular ache .
I can .
removing the conscience .
and you have none , Hessler .
how do you know my name ?
I &apos;ve never seen you before .
that doesn &apos;t mean I &apos;ve never seen you before .
and to look at him is to look at the devil &apos;s spawn , señor .
then pray for me , Telez .
and pray for my father , the devil , too .
you &apos;ll burn in hell where you belong .
you &apos;ll burn for the evil that you &apos;ve done , for the lives you &apos;ve taken .
he has poisoned women for their money .
he deserved the guillotine .
though I had wretched wives , I had an excellent lawyer .
you were never meant for the scaffold , Hessler , nor for a jail .
did you hear that , Telez ?
I am to be immortal .
that is , if your friend here knows what he &apos;s talking about .
he &apos;s not my friend .
perhaps he &apos;s yours .
perhaps he &apos;s the devil .
poor Telez .
I pity him .
pity ?
I don &apos;t understand you .
never having received any pity or pitied anyone , let me plead ignorance .
- I don &apos;t know what it is .
- Have you no feelings at all ?
for these men ?
how can one feel kinship with the dead ?
look at them .
rotting in their graves .
waiting for their bodies to die .
perhaps before that happens , they &apos;ll get out of their graves .
not these .
they &apos;ve dug them too narrow and too deep .
they can never climb out .
- Too weak , perhaps ?
- To be weak is to be dead .
- Then to be strong is to live .
- Hasrt it always been so ?
it seems to me the mighty have fallen from time to time .
we must talk again , monsieur .
you have a brain .
that makes two of us .
Hi , Superman .
how &apos;s the poison holding out ?
always a little left for friends , Verne .
but he can &apos;t take that bunk .
pardon me , but this bunk belongs to someone else .
that so ?
but you don &apos;t understand .
this bunk belongs to Moll .
Moll , huh ?
and right here in the same dormitory .
that &apos;s going to be cozy .
what does that rat mean by taking my bunk ?
but he &apos;s always had this bunk .
then he might &apos;ve known I &apos;d be around for it .
friend of his ?
- Why , yes , we &apos;re friends .
why not ?
- Yeah , why not ?
because he &apos;s a maggot , see .
tell him that I said so .
tell him that Verne says he &apos;s a flatheaded maggot .
go on , tell him .
Moll .
nice hero for the kid , ain &apos;t he ?
a gorilla .
looks from here as if you couldn &apos;t use any part of him .
no , nor any of his friends or monkey ancestors .
- Maybe you &apos;re a pal of his ?
- Maybe .
well , then stand up and cut loose , and I &apos;ll pick it up from there .
and what could either of us win ?
Oh , you &apos;re one of those guys that play it safe , huh ?
safe , or maybe smart .
- You been here long ?
do I know you ?
- I &apos;ve been around .
- Maybe we just never made connections .
- Maybe that &apos;s it .
what &apos;s that book you got there ?
let &apos;s see it .
the Bible ?
forget it , pal , you &apos;re wasting your time .
so ?
maybe you &apos;ve read it .
read it ?
I know this book backwards .
before I came here I laid in solitary for six months at Saint Miguel &apos;s .
there was one in my cage .
well , I didn &apos;t have nothing else to do , I had to read it .
- Well ?
- It don &apos;t make sense .
here , this one will start you talking to yourself .
listen .
&quot; so God created man in his own image . &quot;
how do you like that ?
now take a look at me .
do I look like a god to you ?
this forsaken place is full of gods , I suppose .
only they &apos;re not working at it right now .
they &apos;re gods on a holiday .
answer that one .
it sounds simple enough .
I think it means that each man has some of the qualities of God inside him , if he wants them , and if he looks for them .
there &apos;s a couple here won &apos;th looking for , too .
you remember that one about the Red Sea ?
the waters parted and they crossed on dry land ?
maybe I &apos;ll try it someday on that jungle out there .
I &apos;ll just wave my hand , and there &apos;ll be a path , and I &apos;ll cross over to the mainland .
and if the path ain &apos;t there , I &apos;ll make one .
- You &apos;ll make what ?
- Hello , Moll .
get your filthy carcass off my bunk .
sure , Moll .
where &apos;ll you have it ?
Moll .
we don &apos;t want trouble now .
- I &apos;ll murder the bleeding ...
- They &apos;ll throw you in solitary , Moll .
Yeah , you &apos;re right , kid .
I &apos;ll move down to the other end where the air &apos;s better .
you can have the bunk , Verne .
you &apos;ll need it , kicking off the rest of them years .
that &apos;s not like Moll to back down that way .
he &apos;s not yellow .
- There &apos;s something in the wind .
- Maybe there is , Verne , but maybe it isn &apos;t blowing your way .
Verne .
- Hello , Flaubert .
- You &apos;ve got to help me , Verne .
sure .
what do you want me to do , comb a couple of ghosts out of your hair ?
here &apos;s another one of your gods , pal , only this one &apos;s haunted .
he thinks the people he &apos;s killed are chasing him , and the ones he hasn &apos;t killed are going to kill him .
he gets it coming and going .
- Perhaps if he knew he had one friend .
- But I haven &apos;t , monsieur .
not one , not one in the world .
except you , Verne .
- I &apos;m not your friend .
- But you &apos;ve got to help me .
Moll is planning to escape .
he &apos;s taking six men with him .
- Yeah ?
- He took my money .
a thousand francs for my share of the expenses , and I know he &apos;s going to leave me behind .
I &apos;ll get all the blame .
they &apos;ll beat me .
they &apos;ll put me in solitary .
please , you &apos;ve got to get my money back before it &apos;s too late .
then I can tell Grideau that I &apos;m innocent .
you know that he &apos;s against me , he &apos;s got a grudge against me .
so has Moll .
why do they pick on me all the time ?
why do they make me so miserable ?
you &apos;re against me , too .
you &apos;re all against me .
how about it , Moll ?
you &apos;re making a break , am I in ?
you blasted loon .
- Give me my money , I &apos;m afraid to go .
- Shut up , you weak swine .
- Am I in , Moll ?
- Sure , you &apos;re in nothing .
if you think I &apos;ve spent three years figuring a way to kick out of this joint for your benefit , think again .
you better start thinking , Moll , or else I &apos;m going to slug you .
and if I do , they &apos;ll slap us into solitary together .
and how will you get out then , sweetheart ?
- You can &apos;t make it , Verne .
- Why not ?
you &apos;d have to put up money like the rest of us .
a thousand francs .
- I &apos;ll get it .
- Where ?
there &apos;s a lot of men bunking in this room .
maybe some of them will lend me the money .
I &apos;ll lend it to you , Verne .
a thousand for Verne and a thousand for me .
I &apos;ll go along , too , if you don &apos;t mind .
- Who are you ?
- My name &apos;s Cambreau .
I never heard of you .
you heard of 2,000 francs , didn &apos;t you ?
he &apos;s got them .
all right , if you &apos;re in , listen .
tomorrow they march us out to work on the road .
when we get there , I put this money in a certain place , and a certain bloke &apos;ll come and get it .
it &apos;s to pay for a boat that &apos;ll be hid along the beach ,
- about three days through the jungle .
- How about maps ?
give the mining camp a wide berth .
they &apos;re always on the lookout and they &apos;ll do you dirt .
the Indian village is worse .
they &apos;ll turn you in for 10 francs kicking or five francs cold .
they don &apos;t like to take a chance so they cash in for five .
that &apos;s the cat country .
keep a fire burning at night and lie up close to it .
from here on , look out for crocs and snakes .
and don &apos;t drink no water while you &apos;re in the fever belt .
- You can &apos;t mistake it for the stink of it .
- How many maps you got ?
give me one .
there are only two .
the kid has one and I &apos;m keeping this .
he takes one mob with him and you go along with me .
look out , the guards .
but I &apos;ve less than 12 hours .
just lend me enough to get on the boat .
if I lent money to every girl who was ordered out of the colony , where would I be ?
out of business , cherie , believe me ...
- Please , Renard .
I promise you , I ...
- There &apos;s nothing to worry about Julie .
it so happens that I &apos;m making a little trip myself to the mainland , and it is as easy to arrange passage for two as for one .
you &apos;d like to buy in that way , wouldn &apos;t you , Monsieur Pig .
Julie , if you only knew me better , I &apos;m not such a bad fellow .
look .
look , Julie we &apos;ll go to the mainland , and then when we get there , and if you still don &apos;t think better of me , then you may do as you please .
I &apos;ll do as I please right now .
and that doesn &apos;t include you .
can &apos;t you get that straight ?
remember this , Pig .
you &apos;re the one man in the world I could never get low enough to touch .
- Now get out of here and leave me alone .
bravo , Julie .
I won &apos;t hurry , Julie , because , it looks like you may have to adjust your standards .
why will she , Monsieur Pig ?
Oh , you have a better proposition , Monsieur Marfeu ?
Julie can return to the mining camp with me , and I &apos;ll have a couple of Indians take her up the coast in a small boat .
and she &apos;ll owe me nothing .
and you believe that , Julie ?
no , of course not .
then if you go with him , you &apos;re a fool .
and if I go with you , what am I ?
- When do we leave , Marfeu ?
- In the morning .
you didn &apos;t see that , do you hear ?
unless you want me to give it to you , too .
only one man can run a thing like this .
this is my show and I &apos;m running it my way .
anybody know anything about this ?
of course not .
- Take him to the hospital .
- Right .
all right , hut .
watch yourselves .
come on .
the road gang just made a break .
Moll and a couple of guys got away .
okay , Moll .
only one of these days comes the payoff .
Yes , my dear brethren , the day of salvation is at hand .
all right , back to your places .
all right , settle down there .
and no talk .
he &apos;ll head for the mainland .
when he gets there , if he does , I &apos;ll be waiting for him to bring him back .
we &apos;ll go this way , Moll .
here , when Benet comes back , we &apos;ll follow this trail to the beach .
he &apos;ll never come back .
they &apos;ll kill him .
Moll warned us to keep clear of that Indian village .
what have we got to lose ?
if Benet gets back we eat .
they &apos;ve got him , I tell you , and they &apos;ll get us .
- We &apos;ll never get out of this alive .
- Maybe you won &apos;t , but I will .
why you and not us ?
because I &apos;ve prayed and I will be saved .
you might have prayed for me , too .
it &apos;s not his god he &apos;s counting on , it &apos;s the food he has hidden .
and what if I have ?
it &apos;s all mine , do you hear ?
it &apos;s mine .
did you pray for that , Telez , or did you steal it ?
it makes no difference .
it &apos;s God &apos;s will .
Benet .
- They got him .
- Quick .
- Where are you going ?
- After food .
Didrt we decide not to take a chance on that mining camp ?
you decided that .
well , who &apos;s running this , me or you ?
do you want to get caught ?
no , but we &apos;ll need food .
without it , we couldn &apos;t all reach the boat alive .
what of it ?
the best of us &apos;ll get through , won &apos;t they ?
and that &apos;s us .
all of us aren &apos;t going to get through anyway .
you know that , don &apos;t you ?
you picked the men who were to go with you very carefully , Moll .
sure I did .
do you know why ?
because we &apos;ll be at least 10 days in that boat , and there are rations enough for six men .
figure it out for yourself .
I &apos;ve already figured it out , Moll .
and we &apos;d better be careful with those rations .
I &apos;ll be back .
he &apos;s asking for trouble .
what with them murdering Indians and jungle animals , he ain &apos;t got an earthly .
he &apos;ll be back .
I &apos;ll bet on it .
because he said he would .
because he says something , does that make it so ?
it has so far .
he said we &apos;d reach that mining camp this afternoon , and we did .
according to the map , we should have reached it .
three times we were lost , and each time he led us back to the trail .
he stumbled on it .
and when our tongues were hanging out from thirst , he stepped off the trail and found a brook .
what was that , Moll ?
so he had a lucky day .
- Who is Cambreau ?
- How do I know ?
Oh , he &apos;s just another prison mug like you and me .
of course he is .
he &apos;s got to be .
this jungle heat does crazy things to your mind .
rain again .
you &apos;re not leaving us , are you , Julie ?
now , is that nice ?
Havert I been pretty decent about everything ?
- Gave you a first class home , didn &apos;t I ?
- Yeah , you &apos;re grand people .
you brought me here as a favor to help me on my way to the mainland .
and it wasrt going to cost me a thing .
- Oh , now , Julie .
- Let me by .
so you think you &apos;re checking out , eh ?
well , what have I got to say about it ?
- Go on , tell me .
what ?
- Put that down , you little ...
Julie .
not that way , Julie .
the voice came from here .
I heard it .
the sack of food &apos;s gone .
he paid for it , too , whoever it was .
five hundred francs would take you to the mainland .
but we can &apos;t have any of that , can we ?
look at him sleep .
he &apos;s got his belly full of food .
you &apos;re young and quick .
look . there &apos;d be only one blow .
he &apos;d never know .
- Go on .
- I can &apos;t .
I don &apos;t know how to kill .
come on , let &apos;s get out of here .
Marfeu , maybe I &apos;ve been a bad loser .
I &apos;ve fought as hard as I could and it got me nothing .
I don &apos;t know what I expected .
maybe what I got .
- Maybe I figured you wrong from the start .
- You made a mistake .
we can assume it was not your first .
look , I &apos;ve been here now for , well , for a while .
Shouldrt that be enough ?
give me a chance , Marfeu .
let me go , will you ?
there should be violins playing when you talk that way , Julie .
you &apos;ve got the money that was left for the food .
it &apos;s enough to get me to the mainland .
I &apos;ll pay it back .
I promise , every sou , as soon as I can get it .
I swear .
Yeah ?
and what do I win ?
why do you think I pulled you out of a mess back there , and brought you here ?
to send you away in a golden carriage ?
you &apos;re not going anyplace .
you &apos;re staying here until I throw you out .
can you understand that ?
don &apos;t move , or I &apos;ll brain you .
I want grub and I want it quick .
get over there .
Hello , baby .
caught up with you like I said , didn &apos;t I ?
so we &apos;ll pick up where we left off , only first I &apos;ll have something to eat .
- Get it out here .
- Lf you want any food , get it yourself .
open them cans .
hug that bed , you .
one funny move and I &apos;ll crack your leg .
dump it in there .
sit over there where I can watch you .
garbage .
but good enough for a man when he &apos;s starving .
- So you &apos;ll do , too , baby .
- Thanks .
this is no time to be particular .
funny a man should want something he &apos;s got no use for , and I got no use for you .
you know that , don &apos;t you ?
and how much do you think I think of you ?
how much ?
so much that if you ever made the mistake of turning your back on me ,
- I &apos;d ...
- You &apos;d run a knife into it ?
you ain &apos;t got that kind of stuff , sweetheart .
there they are , but you won &apos;t use them .
it takes something to gamble that way , something a cheap dame hasn &apos;t got .
and you &apos;re cheap .
if you &apos;d have waited back there , and run the scissors into me when I wasrt looking , I &apos;d have loved you for it , but you sneaked out for the law .
that &apos;s what a cheap dame would do .
so tomorrow the Indians can have you .
do I say thanks , baby , or were you just waving at something ?
don &apos;t thank me .
I didn &apos;t give you a thing .
all I want is to get out of here and you happened to be going my way , so I played you .
but the minute I find somebody going faster than you , I &apos;ll ...
you won &apos;t .
come on .
- What are you after ?
- Something somebody left for me .
never mind that .
come on .
&quot; behold , thou art fair , my love , behold , thou art fair .
&quot; thine eyes are as doves behind thy veil .
&quot; thy lips are like a thread of scarlet and thy mouth is comely .
&quot; thy temples are like a piece of pomegranate , behind thy veil .
&quot; thou art all fair , my love , and there is no spot in thee . &quot;
how do you like that , baby ?
great stuff , huh ?
I guess nobody ever said anything like that to you before , did they ?
does that put me out in front or not ?
listen . &quot; thou hast ravished my heart , my sister , my bride .
&quot; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes .
&quot; how fair is thy love , my sister , my bride .
&quot; how much better is thy love than wine ,
&quot; and the smell of thine ointments than all manner of spices .
&quot; thy lips , O my bride , drop as the honeycomb .
&quot; honey and milk are under thy tongue
&quot; and the smell of thy garments is like the smell of Lebanon . &quot;
that &apos;s saltwater , Moll .
you can &apos;t drink it .
you &apos;ll go mad .
saltwater ?
it &apos;s this heat .
where &apos;s the boat ?
there &apos;s water in the boat and food .
- Where is it ?
- Around that point of land .
I &apos;ll find it .
you stay here .
we made it .
the swine .
thought they could lock me up forever .
Moll .
- Hello , kid .
how are you ?
- Cambreau gave us food and water .
- We &apos;ll be all right .
- Sure you will be .
where are the others ?
Dunning was shot as we were leaving the island .
at the Indian village , Benet went after food .
they got him .
what about Telez ?
huh ?
what about Telez ?
he didn &apos;t have the strength .
there was nothing we could do .
he just died .
it &apos;s true , Moll , we tried to save him .
I swear it .
who cares ?
so he died .
one less to go in the boat .
five of us .
and more than enough room for seven .
it &apos;s too bad Verne was hurt .
maybe it &apos;s healthier where he is .
maybe he wouldn &apos;t fit in my plans .
plans often have to be changed , Moll .
you &apos;re such a pessimist , Cambreau .
has nothing ever turned out well for you ?
quite the contrary , Hessler .
many things have happened just as I planned them .
Telez !
I &apos;ll kill them .
they stole my crucifix .
a healthy-looking ghost , Monsieur Dufond .
he had food , he wouldn &apos;t give us any .
it was our lives or his .
what would you have done , Moll ?
we were starving .
I &apos;d have done the thing up right and finished him .
they took my bread and my cross .
they left me to die .
easy , you &apos;re hurt .
let &apos;s have a look at that leg .
Dufond , tear away the trouser .
he &apos;s been bitten by a snake .
- Let us help you , Telez .
- No , not you .
don &apos;t you touch me .
don &apos;t let him touch me .
he &apos;s the devil .
he &apos;s the devil , I tell you .
do you suppose that &apos;s the answer , Moll ?
interesting idea there , anyway .
Cambreau , the devil .
this swelling will have to be lanced , Cambreau .
- You seem to know what you &apos;re doing .
- I was a medical student , a lifetime ago .
let &apos;s have your knife , Flaubert .
- I haven &apos;t got a knife .
- Moll , get his knife .
Moll , I ...
easy .
- It won &apos;t drain unless someone ...
- Well ?
I can &apos;t do it .
my lips are chapped .
I &apos;ll get the poison in my system .
then again , you might not .
the point is , it has to be done .
I hope that &apos;ll help you , Telez .
that was a pretty gesture .
but lancing that wound and drawing out the venom won &apos;t help .
- He &apos;ll be dead at dawn .
- Could we let him die believing that none of us cared whether he lived or not ?
why not ?
it &apos;s the truth , isn &apos;t it ?
why should he die believing a lie ?
maybe he won &apos;t .
maybe Telez will know the truth when it &apos;s time .
where are all the others ?
they &apos;re getting the sloop .
they won &apos;t sail without me .
how little you know men .
how evil they are .
only God is good .
but the good in man is God , Telez .
only God is good .
only God can forgive .
they stole my crucifix , Cambreau .
without it , I &apos;m lost .
I &apos;m afraid .
a crucifix is a piece of wood , Telez , only a piece of wood .
the miracle is not in the wood , but in the heart .
- But I &apos;ve prayed , I &apos;ve prayed .
- And your prayers were only words .
like your crucifix , they found no way to your heart .
Telez , the bread stood between them and your heart .
but it wasrt enough .
I had to look out for myself .
and will you look out for yourself , then , through all eternity ?
- I know , God has forsaken me .
- You have forsaken him .
I &apos;ll die in darkness and be cursed .
I &apos;ll never find peace or forgiveness .
Cambreau , help me , help me to find God .
then look for him , Telez .
search your heart .
you drew the poison from my body into your own .
I had bread and I would not share it .
&quot; or what man is there of you ,
&quot; whom , if his son ask bread , will he give him a stone ? &quot;
it &apos;s not too late ?
it &apos;s never too late .
a moment ago , there was so much darkness .
I was afraid .
it &apos;s lighter now .
my fear is gone .
you brought me peace , Cambreau , and rest .
and if , some time , things are said against me , you &apos;ll speak for me ?
I &apos;ll speak for you , Telez .
what makes you think he &apos;ll like it better under a lot of dirt than in the belly of a shark ?
well , maybe he rates a grave at that .
he paid for it .
- Here , here &apos;s your end .
- I &apos;m afraid I can &apos;t use it , Verne .
Oh , so I &apos;m a swine for robbing the dead ?
maybe if I &apos;d crack through with enough for a boat to take us to the mainland you wouldn &apos;t come along .
here , here &apos;s your book of rules .
maybe you can talk him into a set of wings .
I can try .
&quot; know ye not that ye are the temple of God ,
&quot; and that the spirit of God dwelleth in you ?
&quot; if any man defile the temple of God , him shall God destroy
&quot; for the temple of God is holy , which temple ye are . &quot;
that &apos;s nice music , only what does it mean ?
you heard what he said , didn &apos;t you , about the temple of God ?
you know who he &apos;s talking about , don &apos;t you ?
about me .
all right , you don &apos;t have to believe it if you don &apos;t want to , but I &apos;m telling you .
whenever you want , what &apos;s the word , Cambreau , sanctuary .
whenever you want sanctuary , babe , here &apos;s where you &apos;ll find it .
right here in the old temple .
don &apos;t tap your heart , you &apos;ll break your finger .
and if you &apos;re sanctuary , I &apos;ll take whatever else is lying around .
Yeah ?
well , you better get ready to take it , babe , because here it comes .
so , Verne made it , did he ?
give me that knife of yours , Flaubert .
and he brought a woman along with him , too .
now ain &apos;t that thoughtful ?
Hello , Verne .
you made it through , huh ?
I &apos;d have been here sooner if a shoe hadrt slipped out of somebody &apos;s hand and landed on my head .
you ought to fire your valet for being so careless .
I see you brought a friend along with you , too .
always room for one more in the boat .
and if there isn &apos;t , you can always stay behind .
we &apos;ll cut up our rations with you , and our water .
what do you say ?
- Big-hearted , ain &apos;t you , Moll ?
- Why not ?
we &apos;re all together , aren &apos;t we ?
everything is share and share alike with us .
with all of us , ain &apos;t it , with everything ?
sure it is , with everything that &apos;s yours and not mine .
do you get that , Moll ?
and do you get it , you mugs ?
take a good look , because that &apos;s all any of you are going to get .
anybody got any other ideas ?
- I have some .
- Wait a minute .
let &apos;s have your knife , Flaubert .
where is it ?
I gave it to Moll .
nothing like a little edge , huh , sweetheart ?
I don &apos;t need any with you , Verne .
I forgot I had it .
throw him in the boat and let &apos;s get out of here .
from now on , I &apos;m in charge .
- Looking for something , Moll ?
- Yeah , something I lost .
- Where &apos;d you lose it ?
- On the beach .
somebody got lucky with a punch .
well , maybe someday you &apos;ll get lucky , too .
when you stop leading with your chin .
how do you like being the only woman in the world , Julie ?
well , I don &apos;t take these shipboard romances seriously .
- Still it has its advantages .
- And perhaps its disadvantages , too .
we might decide we don &apos;t want any women in this particular world .
and you &apos;re just the baby to take care of that , aren &apos;t you , Hessler ?
but then I figure I &apos;m safe .
you always married your women before you poisoned them , isn &apos;t that so ?
and I don &apos;t think the captain would marry us .
or why don &apos;t you start reading out of that book , and I &apos;ll jump off the boat .
don &apos;t give me any of that &quot; sister , come to salvation &quot; look .
I &apos;m not buying any .
I know the routine .
it starts out with a prayer , and ends up with a Bible in one hand and me in the other .
Hey , baby .
stop messing around with the crew and get back here .
you belong at the captairs table , don &apos;t ever forget that .
- What was that for , baby ?
- For fun , that &apos;s what .
so we &apos;re playing games , are we ?
okay .
what &apos;ll we play , sweethearts ?
why not ?
it &apos;s a game we &apos;re good at anyway .
then get one up here fast .
again .
again ?
very pretty .
so sweet , so touching and sickening .
what good can ever come from a man like that ?
or a woman like that ?
I &apos;ve heard of it happening before .
why can &apos;t it happen again ?
we ought to make the mainland in a couple of days , kid , if the wind holds out .
- And what then ?
- That &apos;s what I was wondering .
I thought maybe you and me might string along together .
you wouldn &apos;t want me around , Moll .
I &apos;d just get in your way .
I &apos;m not a good thief .
not that I have the conscience , it just is I haven &apos;t got what it takes to make a man steal .
Oh , but you wouldn &apos;t have to .
you see , I &apos;ve always dodged around alone , because I figured a guy shaves a percentage against himself if he plays it alone .
but I &apos;ve gotten to like you quite a bit , kid , you know ?
like a guy does his kid brother .
how does that strike you ?
well , why shouldn &apos;t I like you , Moll ?
you have everything I haven &apos;t got .
courage , for one thing .
and you &apos;ve been decent to me .
I &apos;d never have made it alone if it hadrt been for you .
and I &apos;ll see you through from here on in .
we &apos;ll travel far and we &apos;ll travel fast .
does that make it a deal ?
- Who &apos;s your pal , kid ?
- You are , Moll .
right .
let &apos;s have some more of that song you were singing , huh ?
over the far horizon
riding the tides of night
perhaps we should all sing .
but what have we got to sing about ?
well , we &apos;re alive and the past is behind us .
and there &apos;s always a chance of something better up ahead , if the wind holds out .
dreaming the whole night through
hoping you &apos;ll shine on some ...
one two , three , four , five .
five days .
we &apos;ll die here .
all of us .
Moll .
I &apos;ve got to have water .
now hold onto yourself , kid .
if you drink yours now , you &apos;ll be thirsty by night .
the surll dry it out of you just as fast as you pour it in .
but it &apos;s so hot , it &apos;s so hot .
why doesn &apos;t the wind come ?
Cambreau , why doesn &apos;t the wind come ?
the wind should come soon .
but before it comes , some of us may die .
did you hear what he said , Verne ?
before the wind comes ...
that &apos;s what he says , and I say he &apos;s wrong .
I know as much about it as he does .
but he knew when the wind was dying .
he told us to be careful of the water because there &apos;d be days of calm .
- He does know , Verne .
- All right , he knows .
any minute now , he &apos;ll pull a fast one out of that little book of his and it &apos;ll rain milk .
come on , Cambreau , go into your miracle .
don &apos;t be a fool , Verne .
I &apos;m no more religious than you are , but does this look like a good time for blasphemy ?
that &apos;s not what you &apos;d call good politics , my friend .
how do you figure some of us will die , Cambreau ?
possibly because there &apos;s no sign of any wind yet , and if the wind doesn &apos;t come , it becomes a matter of endurance , doesn &apos;t it ?
and some of us may not have the strength to pull through .
it &apos;s simple enough when you reason it out , isn &apos;t it ?
I &apos;m sorry to disappoint all you big , strong gorillas , but I feel fine .
you &apos;re the second best man in the boat , baby .
I can &apos;t stand it any longer .
Moll , I &apos;ve got to have water .
- All right , kid .
- No , you can &apos;t have it .
- Get away from that keg .
- You can &apos;t give him any .
- What about the rest of us ?
- He can have my share , can &apos;t he ?
get away from that keg , Flaubert .
get back where you were , Moll .
get away from that keg or I &apos;ll pitch you out of the boat .
now .
- Let &apos;s see you get it now .
- You fool .
- Well , that &apos;s the end of the water .
- And the end of hope .
you &apos;re thinking it &apos;s my fault .
why don &apos;t you say so ?
shut up .
it &apos;s done and that &apos;s that .
well , why doesn &apos;t somebody do something about getting it back ?
sharks .
- Arert you going to do anything to me ?
- Why should we ?
but I threw away your water and you &apos;ll die .
you &apos;ll die with us if we do .
I thought they were trying to take something away from me , but they werert , were they ?
no .
all these years , I &apos;ve been afraid of things that didn &apos;t exist .
I looked for enemies where I might have found friends .
I tried to escape a life that I might have been forgiven for .
Flaubert !
no , let him go , kid .
Moll thinks I &apos;m afraid , but I &apos;m not .
you know I &apos;m not afraid , don &apos;t you , Cambreau ?
you &apos;re not afraid , Dufond .
Verne .
come back here .
- Come back here .
- Let me go .
I didn &apos;t mean to hurt you , kid , but it would have been suicide .
- You wanted to save him , didn &apos;t you , Moll ?
- Sure , that &apos;s all .
- He &apos;ll be all right in a jiffy .
- I &apos;m afraid not , Moll .
- Why ?
what do you mean ?
- He &apos;s dead .
but he can &apos;t be .
why ?
why should he be ?
kid .
that &apos;s two dead .
don &apos;t let me be afraid , Verne .
do you hear ?
don &apos;t let me be afraid .
why should you be ?
men die every day .
Hessler , come to life and haul in that keg .
the surs going down , Verne .
what about the water ?
all right , Cambreau , dish out what we got coming to us .
the barrel might have leaked .
there may be saltwater in it .
well , give it here , then .
I &apos;ll take a swig of it .
we &apos;d better draw lots for that , Verne .
if you took one swallow of saltwater , your thirst would increase thousands of times over .
and that would mean ...
tell him , Hessler .
the tongue swells until it protrudes from the mouth .
not a very pleasant way to die .
well , why swallow the water ?
why not taste it ?
our palates are in no condition to taste anything , Verne .
you couldn &apos;t tell freshwater from salt until it was down .
that makes it one mars game .
how do we draw lots ?
here , here are four strips .
the one who draws the longest drinks the water .
why four strips when I count five of us in the boat ?
there are only four men , Julie .
but all five of us drink , don &apos;t we ?
I don &apos;t want any free rides .
here , add that to your collection .
take your choice .
well , it leaves you and me , huh , baby ?
and one of them is the long one , ain &apos;t it ?
you &apos;re out of luck , Verne , I always get the short end of the deal .
here , in case I lose , this will get you to Marseille .
give my regards to the girls .
so , a mars tongue swells until it chokes him to death .
- How does that sound to you , Moll ?
- What are you waiting for ?
- You aren &apos;t afraid , are you ?
- Maybe I am .
a man don &apos;t like to die .
you don &apos;t want to die either , do you baby ?
take one .
- All right , Moll , take the tiller .
- Wait a minute sweetheart , sit still .
you don &apos;t think we &apos;d ask you to get your own , do you ?
sit right where you are , I &apos;ll fetch it for you .
a little cup of water .
maybe it &apos;s good and maybe it &apos;s bad .
up until now you &apos;ve been pretty lucky , what with one thing and another .
- How lucky do you feel now , Verne ?
- Give it here .
what &apos;s your hurry ?
can &apos;t wait to feel it running down , huh ?
maybe it &apos;ll be nice and cool , and maybe , if it &apos;s salty , it &apos;ll sting and burn , and then you &apos;ll sit there staring , waiting for the old man with the long whiskers .
you know about the old man with the long whiskers , don &apos;t you , Verne ?
he &apos;s been right here on this boat with us all the time .
he got Flaubert and he took the kid .
maybe he could have waited a little while about the kid , though , but I guess it &apos;s all right .
he didn &apos;t mean much to anybody , except to me .
he didn &apos;t have what a man needs in this world , what you &apos;ve got , Verne .
he wasrt strong like you .
he didn &apos;t have your insides .
he didn &apos;t have much of anything .
he was just a nice kid , that &apos;s all .
and maybe he would have missed me if I went first , like the girl there will miss you when you go .
so why should we let her in for that ?
you won &apos;t be needing that anymore .
Cambreau , I don &apos;t want something for nothing , but suppose I &apos;ve been wrong all me life .
would it do any good , do you think , to admit it now ?
if a man came to you and admitted he was wrong and you felt he was sorry , what would you do ?
that &apos;s good enough for me .
I &apos;ve been the world &apos;s biggest sucker , ain &apos;t I , up to now ?
how are you coming , Julie ?
nothing like an ocean trip to put the old kink in your hair .
I &apos;ll bet it looks awful .
Cambreau , tell me .
what makes you guess right all the time ?
it &apos;s like you got an old crystal ball or something that you look into , and you know about things like the wind and the water and the men .
and you got to every one of them , too , before they went .
I didn &apos;t get to them , Julie , they got to themselves .
and now maybe I &apos;m going to die and you &apos;re waiting for me to buy in , too , is that it ?
I don &apos;t think you &apos;re going to die for a long time .
then why buzz around me if I &apos;m not going to die ?
well , you asked me to come over .
and you jumped at the chance .
you thought maybe my black heart had turned white overnight , and I wanted forgiveness .
maybe I &apos;d start telling you about the years I spent kicking myself around till I got good and lost , and then say , &quot; Cambreau , come find me
&quot; and start me off with a clean sheet of paper . &quot;
but I &apos;m no sucker .
can you see me with a job , maybe , and a hall room somewhere , a room of my own ?
can you picture a man tipping his hat to me because I look like he should ?
I &apos;ve lived my way , let me die my way .
maybe if you &apos;d told me all this , Julie , you &apos;d have told me where Verne fits in .
that crystal doesn &apos;t miss a thing , does it ?
so maybe I ought to lie to you and say , &quot; Who cares what happens to Verne ? &quot;
but you &apos;d know the truth .
you &apos;d know I could want a lot of things if Verne were around .
but he &apos;d have to want them , too .
I can &apos;t speak for him .
nobody can do anything for that guy except pray , and I don &apos;t know how to pray .
strange you should say that , Julie .
you &apos;ve been doing nothing else all this time .
Cambreau , why are you doing that ?
Verne .
Verne , he &apos;s dropping the sails .
Cambreau , put them sails up .
what are you trying to do ?
we &apos;re off the mainland .
they &apos;re probably waiting for us .
we &apos;d better heave to and slip in tonight .
what ?
we &apos;re off the mainland ?
Hey , hey , baby .
baby , we made it .
we beat them .
the dogs , we beat them .
all right , turn her adrift .
what about Moll ?
we can &apos;t leave him here .
why not ?
they &apos;ll pick up the boat and find him there .
which is exactly what Verne wants them to do .
- Right , Verne ?
- Right .
- Who is it ?
a friend .
open the door .
I want some of that .
here .
now , easy , kid .
don &apos;t drink it all at once .
there .
there , that &apos;s enough for right now .
Hey , where do you think you &apos;re going ?
- Why ?
I , I thought a ...
- Yeah , well , think again .
get some food on the table .
did you hear that , babe ?
all the food your little basket can hold .
we got through and we &apos;re here alive .
we &apos;re here all right , and then it &apos;s Marseille , Paris , anywhere you say , babe .
because I got it all figured out for us .
you cook up a pretty fancy stew .
what else can you do ?
can you navigate a boat ?
Yes , monsieur , but then I have no boat of my own .
no ?
Hessler .
where did you put that razor ?
right over there .
but my boat is a small one , only 60 feet .
this wouldn &apos;t be Christmas , would it ?
food , clothes , a boat and a skipper .
what more could you want ?
we &apos;ll pay for the use of your boat and your services .
nothing like keeping it clean , huh , Cambreau ?
what sort of men are you , monsieur ?
if you are in trouble , I ...
like the lilies of the field , my friend .
we toil not , neither do we spin .
and this , gentlemen , seems to be as good a time as any for me to be on my way .
even in this benighted town there must be a lady who awaits me , a lonely lady with money .
right back to your old tricks , huh , pal ?
&quot; love the little trade which thou has learned , and be content therewith . &quot;
that &apos;s Marcus Aurelius , Verne , and a wise man , too .
well , Cambreau , I hope you have better luck with Verne than you had with me .
you know , of course , that your chances to herd me into your little flock were limited , because I &apos;m not exactly sheep-like .
and you deal mostly in sheep , don &apos;t you , Cambreau ?
well , perhaps you and I will meet again .
no , Hessler .
I &apos;m afraid we two will never meet again .
be grateful , Cambreau .
without an occasional defeat , your victories would be empty things .
gentlemen .
no .
better get that boat ready , gimpy .
we &apos;ll be sailing pretty soon .
as you say , monsieur , but you should know there is a storm coming up .
what storm ?
I call it a wind and a good one .
- And we &apos;re sailing with it .
now beat it .
- Yes , monsieur .
- What &apos;s the name of your crate ?
- The Dolphin .
she rides at anchor in the lower cove .
how do we know he won &apos;t turn us in ?
- Suppose I follow him .
- And who &apos;ll follow you ?
I &apos;ll be back , Verne .
- Come out here baby , I want to talk to you .
- I &apos;m busy .
I said , come out here .
looks like here &apos;s where we make up our mind about things , huh , baby ?
Hey , makes a difference , don &apos;t it ?
- It &apos;s divine .
- Come here .
- Who &apos;s a rat , baby ?
- You are .
but I &apos;ll do just the same , huh ?
right here .
a woman would be a chump to go on with a guy like me , wouldn &apos;t she ?
what could she win ?
it &apos;s what you call making it the hard way .
you can &apos;t travel that way , can you , baby ?
maybe that &apos;s it .
but you &apos;d do me a favor and drag me along with you anyway , wouldn &apos;t you ?
- From sewer to sewer .
- But on plush cushions .
if there &apos;s anything I want all I have to do is ask for it , and you &apos;d steal it for me .
well , there &apos;s nothing I want you could steal .
so that &apos;s it ?
suppose I said , &quot; Listen , honey , as soon as we get to Cuba ,
&quot; we &apos;re getting married and from there on we &apos;re playing it according to the book ? &quot;
maybe you could use a little of that , huh ?
not if it came from you , Verne , because you couldn &apos;t say it .
but suppose I did ?
suppose I promoted that little home by the side of the road ,
- with the kiddies playing in the sunshine ?
- You &apos;re laughing .
and how I &apos;m laughing .
where &apos;d you pick up that junk , from Cambreau ?
maybe I thought it out all by myself .
well , from now on it &apos;s going to be different .
Yeah .
and do you know why ?
because I &apos;ve seen men die .
they were thieves like you and as rotten as me , but when their time came , they suddenly got hold of something , something they &apos;d never had , something won &apos;th having .
well , whatever it is , I don &apos;t want to wait that long for mine .
I want it now .
great stuff , so long as it fits in with what I got in mind .
when we travel , we travel my way .
what makes you think I &apos;m going your way .
because you &apos;re stuck , kid , that &apos;s why .
you &apos;re a liar .
I hate the sight of you .
I hate everything you stand for .
even if I didn &apos;t , even if I loved you so much it was killing me , and I knew you &apos;d haunt me for the rest of my life ,
I still wouldn &apos;t have any part of you .
I only hope they take you back to that prison you belong in .
you &apos;ll be better off back there than free to do the things you will do .
the whole world will be better off without you .
and that &apos;s how it is , babe , and what can we do about it ?
- Well , it &apos;s hard for me to believe .
- It &apos;s plain enough .
this cask was full of saltwater , so they must have died of thirst .
and this man , Moll , was the last to go .
I &apos;d have staked anything that Verne would outlive them all .
unless , monsieur , he went first with a knife in his back ?
well , it &apos;s possible , and it &apos;s too bad .
he was the only one of the pack won &apos;th saving .
well , may as well get back to the colony .
- That boat out there , do you belong on it ?
- No .
there &apos;s nobody coming ashore from her tonight .
sails for America at dawn .
would they take a passenger , do you think ?
- Well , how do I get out to her ?
- In a rising gale ?
maybe you can hire someone to take you out , but that ain &apos;t me .
good evening , Julie .
- What are you doing here ?
- I might ask the same thing of you .
where else should I be ?
I &apos;m on my way to America .
I sail in the morning .
- America is so far away .
- Far away from what ?
who knows ?
perhaps , Julie , if you were to go back to the colony you might be very happy if it could be arranged , and I think it can .
since we talked , things have happened that might ...
that might increase my influence with certain people .
but no matter how you color it up , you go with the proposition , don &apos;t you , Pig ?
you could do worse , say with a man like Verne .
what about Verne ?
he escaped with some others and Grideau and I came to pick him up when he landed here .
- And have you got him ?
it seems he died at sea , or that &apos;s what Grideau thinks .
but you don &apos;t .
smart man , Verne .
he has something .
something I &apos;d like to have .
lovely , aren &apos;t they , Julie ?
Yeah , lovely .
you &apos;d look ducky in that black one .
any way out of this place except this door ?
the alley around the corner .
it &apos;s a small world , isn &apos;t it , Pig ?
just what is it you &apos;re after ?
we both know what , Julie .
and it &apos;s time we talked about facts .
there are worse things , Julie , than stringing with a pig like me .
there is such a thing as watching a man that means something to you hunted down and dragged back on the end of a chain .
all right , so you &apos;ve hunted him down .
let &apos;s see you drag him back .
I am no fool .
there is a better way .
Grideau won &apos;t let him get away this time .
but if I go back with you , you won &apos;t tell Grideau ?
it &apos;s me for Verne , is that it ?
well , if it is , then take him .
go tell Grideau .
and as for my going anyplace with you , I still pick my own gutters .
wait a minute .
pig , wait a minute .
just give me five minutes , that &apos;s all .
five minutes to make sure he gets away and after he &apos;s gone , I &apos;ll go with you .
it would be simpler if we just went away together now .
no , I want to see him go , I want to be sure .
don &apos;t you trust me , Julie ?
after you see him go , come in and get me .
I &apos;ll wait for you .
so , you &apos;re back , baby .
nice to see you again .
I &apos;ve come back to tell you you got to get out .
- Grideau &apos;s in town .
- Grideau , eh ?
nice fellow .
what &apos;d he have to say for himself ?
well , I didn &apos;t talk to him .
I didn &apos;t even see him .
no ?
then how do you know he &apos;s here ?
or maybe you talked to somebody else .
don &apos;t ask so many questions .
just get going .
there &apos;s a storm coming up and you never can tell .
you &apos;re right , kid , you never can tell .
- Okay , let &apos;s go .
- I &apos;m not going with you , Verne .
I told you that once before and I meant what I said .
I thought maybe you &apos;d changed your mind .
there &apos;s a freighter pulling out for America in the morning and I &apos;m going to be on it .
okay , baby if that &apos;s what you want .
Yeah .
Yeah , that &apos;s what I want .
only , don &apos;t hang around here any longer .
every minute counts .
get going .
Yes .
Yes , you &apos;re right , kid .
I &apos;d better hustle .
Grideau is a smart fellow .
he won &apos;t want to miss out on me again .
I wouldn &apos;t be surprised if he &apos;d offered a reward .
a nice fat one .
juicy enough to buy passage to America on a freighter .
good thing you can be trusted .
so long , babe .
- Verne .
- Yeah ?
plant one here .
it &apos;ll hold until we meet up again .
Julie .
I &apos;ll buy you a new coat , a nice one in the morning .
made out of pigskin .
so , Grideau &apos;s got himself two pigs now .
I didn &apos;t tell him .
I swear I didn &apos;t , Verne .
you &apos;re a liar .
you brought him here .
you turned me over just like you did back there on the island to keep your own hide out of trouble .
if that &apos;s what you want to think , okay .
only get out of here .
get out of here before it &apos;s too late .
I &apos;m thinking of you , Verne .
Yeah , yeah , very cute .
you always could pour it on , couldn &apos;t you ?
you had me winging , I &apos;ll say that for you , right smack up to the minute where I saw you through the window , both of you .
I wasrt going to turn you in , Verne .
it &apos;s a great spot for a dame to bring a guy up to a point where he can &apos;t see anything else in the world except her .
you had me where there was nothing I wouldn &apos;t have done for you .
I &apos;d have gone on being a thief or I &apos;d have tried it the other way , if that was what you wanted .
how does that sound ?
it &apos;s everything I &apos;ve wanted to hear .
only why did you have to wait till now to tell me , now that you &apos;ve got to get out of here ?
she &apos;s right .
and if you go now they &apos;ll never catch you .
come on , Pig , where &apos;s Grideau ?
is he on his way here or is he waiting to pick me up at the cove ?
Verne , I haven &apos;t told a soul .
why should I ?
Verne , he &apos;s telling the truth .
he hasn &apos;t told anyone you &apos;re here .
and if I let him go what do you think he &apos;ll do ?
so , you made a mistake , Pig .
this is one time in your life you should &apos;ve squealed .
if you ran away now , Julie , you could get on that boat to America .
- That &apos;s just what I &apos;m going to do .
- But if you stayed you could save him .
- Save the Pig for what ?
- Not the Pig , Julie , Verne .
Verne , you fool .
let him go .
did you hear me , Verne ?
I said let him go .
Oh , so that &apos;s the way it is , huh ?
when a woman picks up a mars fight , she &apos;s really on his side , ain &apos;t she ?
give me that .
all of a sudden , things look different , don &apos;t they , baby ?
stand over there with him and let &apos;s see what you look like .
get over there .
all right , there he is , Julie .
take him .
he &apos;s yours .
that &apos;s what you &apos;re asking for , isn &apos;t it ?
well , is it or isn &apos;t it ?
Yeah , that &apos;s it .
all right , you &apos;ve got it .
now get out of here both of you .
come on , get moving .
- Goodbye , Cambreau .
- I &apos;ll see you again , Julie .
of course , the facts are , she &apos;s always hated the Pig .
she went to the jungle with Marfeu rather than go with him .
and she &apos;d rather go back with the Pig than go on with me .
what &apos;s that look like from where you stand ?
it looks like something a woman in love might think of .
I get it .
you &apos;ve got it all figured out according to the book .
Julie put on an act with Cochon for my benefit , so I wouldn &apos;t throw a slug into him .
now she &apos;s going back to the island to marry him so he won &apos;t turn me in to the law , huh ?
very nice .
get some music , I &apos;ll sing it for you .
it &apos;s just that it makes sense to me that way .
and what if you &apos;re right ?
what am I supposed to do ?
turn noble and go back to a dozen bear pits to get her out of hock ?
I &apos;ve come a long ways to get here .
I &apos;m out and I &apos;m on my way and if you &apos;re coming , come on .
- All right , get in the dinghy .
- But , monsieur , it will be a heavy storm .
perhaps we should wait until tomorrow morning .
get in that boat .
come on , Cambreau .
get below and start that engine .
not bad .
good enough to take a man anywhere he wants to go .
any place in the world .
- Sounds like you &apos;re a free man , Verne .
- As free as any man alive .
in three or four days , maybe a week , I &apos;ll be in Cuba .
I won &apos;t have to sneak in the back way neither .
so far as anybody knows , I &apos;m dead .
the Pig knows you &apos;re alive , so does Hessler .
Hessler won &apos;t talk .
neither will the Pig .
Julie won &apos;t let him .
how do you know ?
it won &apos;t be the first time she turned you in .
I know she won &apos;t .
she &apos;s all right about some things , things like that .
- Anyway , I &apos;m not going to worry about it .
- But you are .
all your life you &apos;re going to worry about it .
until the day you die , you &apos;re going to be sorry you turned her over to the Pig .
another one of your tinorn prophecies , huh ?
well , keep them to yourself .
I &apos;m a free man , I tell you , and no dame can cut into that .
I &apos;m on my way to Cuba and nothing can stop me .
you &apos;re a strong man , Verne , stronger than Moll was , stronger than the prison you broke from , stronger than the odds that were against you .
what are you getting around to ?
you &apos;ve got everything you &apos;ll ever want , Verne .
you &apos;ll do what you want to do , go where you want .
you &apos;re sufficient unto yourself .
you don &apos;t need a thing .
certainly you don &apos;t need me .
I &apos;m no good here .
and there may be something I can do for someone else , if I stay behind .
you wouldn &apos;t do something for yourself , would you , pal ?
something like talking to Grideau ?
there &apos;s nothing I want from Grideau .
and there may be others to talk to , as there was Telez , Flaubert and Dufond .
you sent them on their way with a smile and a prayer .
do you still think that prayers pay off , Cambreau ?
they may help a little .
well then , you better start saying them quick .
lift up your hands , close your eyes and give them all you got .
I don &apos;t have to make it any clearer , do I ?
there &apos;s only one other man in the world that knows I &apos;m alive and who &apos;ll say so outside of you .
I &apos;m depending on a dame to keep his mouth shut ,
- but who &apos;s going to shut yours ?
- It looks like you will , Verne .
but what about you , when I &apos;m gone ?
you &apos;ll have thrown away everything won &apos;th having , the chance to live like other men , a woman who loves you and your last friend .
- What &apos;ll you have left ?
- What I &apos;ve always had .
whatever it is that keeps a man on his own feet without any help from anybody .
- What &apos;s it called , Verne ?
- You name it , I &apos;ve got it .
it &apos;s taking me on my way now .
you can come along , or you can have it the other way .
it &apos;ll have to be the other way .
I can &apos;t go with you , Verne .
well , what are you waiting for ?
it shouldn &apos;t be hard .
throw me into the sea and it &apos;s all over .
- It &apos;s simple enough , if you can do it .
- Lf I can do it ?
- What would I be afraid of ?
- Of yourself , perhaps , or what happens to a man after he &apos;s killed another man .
- You &apos;re asking for it , Cambreau .
- Then why don &apos;t you give it to me ?
or does it take something to kill me you haven &apos;t got ?
now what do you think I got , Cambreau ?
remember , you asked for it !
you asked for it and you got it .
you can &apos;t let him drown .
you have to save him .
why not ?
get forward and ship that anchor .
- Then get on the wheel and head north .
I can &apos;t hang on much longer !
I don &apos;t hear you begging me to help you .
smart stuff , you &apos;re saving your breath .
you don &apos;t want anything from me .
what have I got to give ?
Verne , the scum of the world .
up there , that &apos;s where you &apos;re going to get your help from .
you got nothing to worry about .
sing out some prayers , relax , and wait for the water to dry up .
grab hold of a miracle , Cambreau .
no one can save him but you , monsieur .
did you hear that ?
did you hear what he said , Cambreau ?
in heaven and on Earth , in all the world there &apos;s nobody can save you but me .
so when you say your prayers , say them to me , Cambreau .
I &apos;m the only god you can call on now .
I &apos;m the old temple remember ?
you were right when you said God was in me .
God &apos;s in everybody .
gimpy &apos;s God .
I &apos;m God .
you &apos;re ...
you &apos;re ...
Cambreau !
Cambreau !
Cambreau .
Cambreau .
it &apos;s no use , he &apos;s gone .
he figured it like that .
everything he said , everything he did , he had it all worked out to the end .
you &apos;re an awful sucker to do things like that for rats like me .
monsieur .
Verne , are you crazy ?
Grideau &apos;s on that boat .
he &apos;ll see you .
and if he sees me , he &apos;ll take me , won &apos;t he , baby ?
I thought you &apos;d be halfway to Cuba by now .
maybe I didn &apos;t like the idea of you going with the Pig .
what do you care ?
we &apos;re going to be married , and I expect we &apos;ll be very happy .
Yeah , and maybe you won &apos;t .
maybe you &apos;ll be taking a lot of punishment for a guy like me .
- Cambreau told you .
- No , Cambreau doesn &apos;t work that way .
but I took a look at the figures and they add up to one thing .
- Baby , it &apos;s me , ain &apos;t it ?
- It &apos;s always been you .
that &apos;s what I figured .
Verne , are you sure ?
are you sure this is what you want ?
- Don &apos;t you think it &apos;s the best way ?
- I know it is .
well , the best will always be good enough for us .
Hello , Verne .
- When do we sail , Grideau ?
- Any minute , now that you &apos;re here .
so you found something stronger than you , after all .
Yeah , looks like it , don &apos;t it ?
where &apos;d you get that dress ?
why , I bought it with the money you gave me on the boat .
- And what &apos;s it to you ?
- Okay , okay .
now that &apos;s what you need to keep a guy like me on the island .
not something easy like a jungle , or an ocean ,
- but something like her , tough .
- But won &apos;th waiting for , maybe ?
- As long as it takes .
- He wasrt talking to you .
besides , I &apos;m the one that &apos;ll be doing the waiting , not you .
- Okay to move around ?
- Okay , Verne .
or am I still a sucker ?
what do you think ?
- He won &apos;t be sorry ?
- No , fisherman , he won &apos;t .
and everything will be all right for them someday ?
everything is all right now .
Goodbye , my friend .
Goodbye , monsieur .
extra ! extra !
read all about it !
blonde model murdered !
slayer &apos;s still at large !
read all about it !
- Hey , boy !
- Yes , sir .
thanks . extra !
read all about it !
- &#91; Man &#93; If you know what &apos;s good for you , you &apos;ll come clean .
- When did you find the body ?
- Why &apos;d you do it ?
- I didn &apos;t do it .
- You &apos;ve said that before .
- All right , and I &apos;ll say it again .
- I can keep it up as long as you can .
- Listen , brother .
you don &apos;t seem to get the idea at all . you &apos;re gonna fry for this .
- It means the hot spot .
- It does if you can pin it on me , but I don &apos;t think you can .
I think we can .
you &apos;re a pretty tough guy , aren &apos;t you , with a crowd around ?
- Why don &apos;t you come out in the open so I can see you ?
- Never mind that .
- When did you first meet Vicky Lynn ?
- &#91; Sighs &#93;
say , listen , fellas . why don &apos;t you let me make a record of it ... then you can play it over to yourselves as often as you like .
go ahead , Frankie , just once more .
pick it up when you met her for the first time in that lunchroom on 8th Avenue .
- Okay , MacDonald . for you , I &apos;ll do it . - Thanks .
I &apos;d been to the fights with a couple of friends of mine .
we &apos;d just dropped in for a cup of coffee , and ...
- And hotcakes and coffee .
- Is that all ?
no , but the rest of it isn &apos;t on the menu .
you couldn &apos;t afford it if it was .
- Say , you know something ?
- Yes .
I &apos;m wasting my time being just an ordinary waitress .
&#91; Chuckles &#93; Frankie , you &apos;re losing your grip .
I bet I can take that girl ... inside of six months , put her on top of the ladder .
what ladder ?
you &apos;ve promoted everything from prize-fighters to fan dancers ... but I doubt if even you , maestro , could make a lady out of a hash slinger .
in the right clothes , the right places with the right people , she could get by anywhere .
it might be fun trying , even if it didn &apos;t work .
here she comes now , Frankie . pour on the charm .
how would you like to go to the El Chico Club tomorrow night ?
- This is where I came in .
- I &apos;m not kidding .
I &apos;ll put you in a sable wrap and introduce you to café society . what do you say ?
I say you &apos;re out of your mind .
~ &#91; Band &#93;
Eleanor , I wish you had seen me as Romeo . I was magnificent .
- That was a long time ago , wasn &apos;t it ?
- How old are you , anyhow ?
that , my dear Lady Handel , is a secret that I keep even from my own mother .
- Ah .
- Who is that beautiful girl ?
- Good evening , Mr. Christopher . - Good evening .
I have your table for you .
I say , I &apos;m in luck . it just happens I know the man that &apos;s with her .
- Who is he ?
- Frankie Christopher , a sports promoter .
Prizefights , hockey , ice carnivals and girls .
mostly girls . excuse me .
- Wine with the dinner and coffee later .
- Very good , sir .
- Hello , Christopher .
- Hello , Ray .
Miss Lynn , I &apos;d like you to meet the famous actor , Robin Ray .
actor ?
really ? how do you do ?
listen , you little hash slinger , don &apos;t give me any of that &quot; lady &quot; stuff , or I &apos;ll bite you .
- Am I overdoing it ?
- Yes , but not bad .
Hello , Christopher . how are things ?
- How do you think ?
- I think yes .
Miss Lynn , I &apos;d like you to know Larry Evans , the columnist .
- Larry , this is Miss Vicky Lynn .
- How do you do , Mr. Evans ?
- I &apos;ve read much about you .
- Indeed . flattering , I hope .
naturally . most of it appeared in your own column .
- Ouch .
- Keep it up , Vicky . swell . Yeah .
that last line wasn &apos;t in the script . well , sit down , boys .
sit down . Lynn ? Lynn ?
of the Baltimore Lynns , by any chance ?
no , no . my family came from Boston , the home of the bean , you know ?
is that so ?
do tell .
- May I have the next mazurka ?
- Oh , I &apos;d simply love it .
- Oh , no , you don &apos;t . - Wait a minute .
wait a minute .
I didn &apos;t bring Miss Lynn for you two chiselers to cut in . come on , boys . fight over her .
if she dances with anybody , it &apos;s going to be with me .
let us settle this dispute by claiming the ancient privilege of age before beauty .
- Go scuttle yourself . I saw her first .
- You can &apos;t talk to me like that .
- Gentlemen , gentlemen .
- Beg your pardon .
lady Handel presents her compliments ... and would like to have Mr. Christopher and his party have supper with her .
why , we &apos;d be delighted .
well , you &apos;re in , Vicky . just pick up your feet and feel your way .
- &#91; Clears Throat &#93;
- Come on , Vicky .
all right , boys . let &apos;s go .
may I present Miss Lynn and Mr. Christopher ? lady Handel .
- How do you do , Miss Lynn ?
- How do you do ?
- And Mr. Christopher . - How do you do ?
- Won &apos;t you be seated ?
- Thank you .
Robin , you sit here .
you haven &apos;t put a price on yourself yet .
&#91; horns Honking , Distant &#93;
well , I &apos;ll do everything I can : give you a plug in the column every once in a while .
you might do worse than to have your name linked with mine .
I don &apos;t see how .
good evening , Harry . may I please have my key ?
get that key for Miss Lynn , and be quick about it .
well , uh , good night , gentlemen .
it &apos;s been wonderful , and I &apos;m terribly grateful to you all .
- Well , can &apos;t we go up for a moment ?
- Oh , I &apos;m afraid not .
it &apos;s pretty late , and we might disturb my sister .
- Good night .
- Good night .
- Good night .
- Good night .
- I &apos;ll be around for you first thing in the morning .
I &apos;ll be waiting for you .
- &quot; Sister . &quot;
- I hate girls with sisters .
- What are you beefing about ?
have you seen her yet ?
- No . have you ?
- No .
- Then we &apos;re neck and neck .
they day I find you and I are neck and neck , I &apos;ll know I &apos;m running down .
what &apos;s the matter with you , gettin &apos; so sore ?
she ain &apos;t nobody .
she will be , and when she is , you &apos;ll be lucky if you &apos;re in the same neighborhood .
- What made you so sure you could make something of her ?
- That &apos;s my business : Promotion .
she had looks , youth , a good figure . what more do you want ?
- I &apos;m asking the questions .
- Then hurry up . I &apos;ve got an appointment at the Garden .
- Okay , MacDonald .
- Now , listen , Frankie .
there &apos;s been a murder committed , and we &apos;re just trying to get to the bottom of things .
that &apos;s all .
- &#91; Man &#93; What &apos;s your name ?
- &#91; Woman &#93; Jill Lynn .
- &#91; Man &#93; Any initials ? - No .
just plain &quot; Jill . &quot;
- What relation are you to the dead girl ?
- She was my sister .
how long have you been living in New York ?
well , Vicky had been here a couple of years , and after Mom died ...
I came on from Chicago to set up housekeeping with her .
even though we shared the apartment , I saw very little of her the last few weeks .
- Why was that ?
- Well , you see , I have a position as a stenographer downtown ... and Vicky was working on a night shift in a restaurant .
- We just kept different hours .
- What do you know about this man Frankie Christopher ?
nothing , except he was the one who first gave Vicky those grand ideas ... about becoming a celebrity .
when did this start ?
the first time I knew it was serious was the night she came home from a nightclub .
it was very late , and I had fallen asleep on the couch .
&#91; door Unlatching &#93;
Jill . Jill , what do you think ?
I &apos;ve done it . I &apos;m a success .
- What is all this ?
- You know what happened ?
lady Handel invited me over to her table .
I met all the big shots , danced with all the good-looking young men .
I &apos;ve just got dozens and dozens of invitations .
invitations to do what ?
- I &apos;m never going back to that rotten old restaurant job .
- What ?
why should I ?
now I realize I &apos;ve been wasting my time .
- I can be somebody .
- Vicky , you &apos;re not serious about giving up your job ?
of course . why should I go on slinging hash when I can sling other things ?
Vicky Lynn , have you gone right out of your mind ?
no , I haven &apos;t . I &apos;ve just come to my senses . that &apos;s all .
Frankie Christopher thinks I have a great career before me .
- Who &apos;s Frankie Christopher ?
- Oh , Jill , everyone knows Frankie Christopher .
- He &apos;s a famous sports promoter .
- What does he want you to do ?
Roller-skate or go over Niagara Falls in a barrel ?
Jill , I already have an offer to pose for a magazine cover and a cigarette ad ...
Vicky , wait a minute . when Mom died , we promised we &apos;d look out for each other .
don &apos;t you think you &apos;re making a fool of yourself ?
- What do you mean ?
- This Frankie Christopher .
people like that , what have they got to do with people like us ?
- Jill , they &apos;re going to help me .
- In what way ?
they &apos;re gonna glamorize me .
they may have started this thing as a gag , but after taking one look ... at those million-dollar debutantes tonight ...
I realized I can give them cards in spades and still come out on top .
Vicky , you &apos;ll never come out on top by any shortcut .
one week , your face is on the cover of a magazine ; the next , it &apos;s in the ash can .
I know I sound stuffy . gee , I like a good time as well as the next .
Jill , you &apos;re terribly sweet , but , well , we are different .
I know the things I want , and I know how to get them .
so stop worrying about me , huh ?
okay .
what you need now is sleep . if you lose your looks , you &apos;ve lost your bankroll .
good night .
&#91; man &#93; When was the first time you met Frankie Christopher ?
it was the following morning . I was cooking breakfast ...
&#91; knocking &#93;
- Vicky , I think he &apos;s here .
- &#91; Vicky &#93; Okay . I &apos;m putting on a dress .
- Is Miss Lynn in ?
- Which Miss Lynn ?
the glamour girl , or just the plain , ordinary garden variety ?
- Ohh , you &apos;re her sister .
- You &apos;re quick .
- I &apos;m Frankie Christopher .
- That &apos;s what I was afraid of .
- May I come in ?
- Sure .
course , this is just a dump , but if you can find a place to sit down ...
say , why all the cracks ?
you don &apos;t know anything about me yet .
I don &apos;t know anything about art , but I know what I like .
what &apos;s the idea of handing Vicky this line about making her a big shot ?
that &apos;s no line . I believe it sincerely .
after all , that &apos;s my business ... discovering talent and trying to put it across .
here . take a look at that .
Hmm . feeding time at the zoo .
- Where are you ?
- I don &apos;t believe in having my picture taken .
that &apos;s for those I &apos;m trying to put across . I just stay in the background , where I belong .
- Modest , aren &apos;t you ?
- Not particularly .
it &apos;s just a superstition , that &apos;s all .
- &#91; Vicky &#93; Is that Frankie ?
- Yes , dear .
hold him for me , Jill . don &apos;t let him get away .
you come out and do your own holding .
- Good morning , Frankie .
- That &apos;s a nice dress you &apos;ve put on .
from that moment on , life became just one great , dizzy world for her .
she got offers to pose for advertisements ... model clothes , join the ice ballet , every possible form of publicity .
she even remembered the singing lessons Mom had paid for ... and suddenly started to fancy herself as a chanteuse .
Frankie even managed to get her a job singing with a name band .
finally , one morning , things came to a climax .
I wonder what &apos;s keeping him . I left a message hours ago .
why , Jill , what are you getting so excited about ?
nothing . except he &apos;s going to be awfully mad .
- Don &apos;t worry . I can handle him .
- Glad you think so .
- I wouldn &apos;t be in your shoes for all the gold in Kentucky .
- &#91; Knocking &#93;
- Do you think that &apos;s him ?
- Uh-huh . I know his knock . come in .
- What &apos;s up ?
- Well , it &apos;s not exactly going to be a wedding .
I &apos;m sorry . I was up all night .
darling , something terrible has happened . I ...
I don &apos;t quite know how to tell you , it &apos;s so embarrassing , but ...
of course I realize everything you &apos;ve done for me , but , well ... life is so uncertain nowadays , isn &apos;t it ?
- Get to the point .
- Well , I ...
- I &apos;m going away .
- Away ?
where ?
I couldn &apos;t help it , really I couldn &apos;t . I just happened to run into this man , and ...
purely business , you understand .
- Where are you going ?
- To Hollywood .
Hollywood ?
as I said , I just happened to run into this man , and he wanted to make a screen test .
I didn &apos;t see any harm in it , so I said yes .
I didn &apos;t wanna tell you in case it turned out badly . I wanted to surprise you .
but it turned out simply wonderfully , and I &apos;ve signed a long-term contract .
- When are you going ?
- I leave tomorrow night .
- Congratulations .
- Oh , now , Frankie , wait a minute . I ...
look , I &apos;ve always been on the level with you , haven &apos;t I ?
- Why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
- Oh , Frankie , I know what you &apos;re thinking .
after all , you did take me out of the restaurant , introduce me to the right people ... and that sort of thing , but , well , I have some brains too .
it was me they were interested in .
some people think I &apos;m a very attractive girl . you didn &apos;t create that .
- I &apos;m no Frankenstein , you know .
- I wonder .
- &#91; Knocking &#93;
- Come in .
Robin , Larry , how sweet of you both to come .
- What &apos;s the matter ?
what happened ?
- Are you all right ?
- I came as soon as I got your message .
- Dear Robin , dear Larry ...
something terrible has happened .
this whole thing started me thinking I was wrong and Vicky was right .
after all , she had ended up with a Hollywood contract ... and I was still pounding a typewriter and breaking my fingernails .
but that &apos;s the trouble with giving advice nowadays . so much of it turns out wrong .
when Vicky told me she had that Hollywood job set up behind my back , I ...
well , you could &apos;ve knocked me down with a feather .
- So you knocked her down instead .
is that it ? - No , wise guy .
I did exactly what you would do . I got cockeyed .
~ &#91; Popular &#93;
- Do you mind turning that thing down a little ?
- Not at all .
- Women are all alike .
- For Pete &apos;s sake , what difference does that make ?
you &apos;ve got to have them . they &apos;re standard equipment .
can you imagine her walking out on me after all that I &apos;ve done for her ? me !
you &apos;ve done for her ?
what have you done for her ?
well , I took her around to all the bright spots . I let her be seen with me everywhere .
- It made her seem important .
- Why , you parboiled old ham .
you don &apos;t think anybody thought there was anything between you two , do you ?
if it hadn &apos;t been for my column , people would &apos;ve thought she was your trained nurse .
why , you ink-stinking word slinger .
I was famous when they were changing your pants 20 times a day .
what &apos;s the use of bickering ?
we &apos;ve all gotten it . we may as well admit it .
- Surely you got some fun out of it .
- That &apos;s where you &apos;re wrong .
all I got was a handshake , a smile and a promise .
I had to sit around with that sourpuss sister of hers waiting for Vicky to come home .
- You &apos;re kidding .
- On the level . night after night .
didn &apos;t you even get a souvenir ?
well , I ... got this .
she gave it to me once when she had an appointment .
she told me to go up to her apartment and wait .
I waited , and she came in with you .
I &apos;ll be darned . there &apos;s another for the scrapbook .
I wonder if there could &apos;ve been somebody else in her life all the time .
well , if there was , he must &apos;ve been a locksmith .
was there anyone in her life before this Frankie Christopher ?
on your last visit to New York , for instance , about a year ago ?
any little incident that you can remember may be of enormous help .
she was working in the restaurant then and working pretty hard .
she didn &apos;t have much time for running around , and ...
now that you mention it , I ... I do remember a queer thing that happened .
I didn &apos;t think much of it at the time , but , well ...
I was sitting in the place one night , waiting for her to finish so we could go home ... when ...
- I &apos;ll be with you in a minute , sis .
- Okay .
Vicky ?
you seem to have an admirer . there was some guy looking through the window at you ... like the wolf looked at the three little pigs .
I &apos;m used to that .
with that plate-glass window ...
I &apos;ve got about as much privacy as a lingerie mannequin .
it doesn &apos;t mean a thing .
that &apos;s the one .
- Gives me the creeps .
- You &apos;ll have to get used to that .
we &apos;ve got more wolves in New York than they have in Siberia .
I saw him several times after that .
he never said anything , never accosted us or bothered us in any way ... but he frightened me .
there was something strange about him , the way he &apos;d look at her ... the way he &apos;d turn up in the most unexpected places .
perhaps if you could find that man , you &apos;d find the murderer .
mysterious stranger , huh ?
young lady , you &apos;ll have to do better than that . me and my partner weren &apos;t born yesterday .
- Why are you trying to protect Frankie Christopher ?
- I &apos;m not trying to protect him .
I just don &apos;t believe he did it .
was there ever anything between you and this Frankie Christopher ?
- What are you saying ?
- You were in love with him , and he didn &apos;t give you a tumble ... so you put your sister out of the way .
- That &apos;s a lie !
let me out of here !
you have no right to talk to me like that .
- Who do you think you are ?
- I &apos;m a poor , underpaid detective trying to get at the facts .
well , I demand to see somebody in authority !
- I wanna see the head man around here !
- Get Cornell .
- We don &apos;t wanna get tough with you unless we have to .
- I told you I didn &apos;t do it .
&#91; detective &#93; Inspector , you &apos;re wanted inside .
all right , boys . keep him warm . I &apos;ll be right back .
- Here you are .
- Thanks .
all right , young lady . here &apos;s the head man .
that &apos;s him !
that &apos;s the man !
- What &apos;s this ? - She &apos;s crazy .
she said she saw a mysterious stranger ... peeking through the window of the joint where her sister worked .
- Now she says it &apos;s Ed .
- What about it , Ed ?
do you peek through windows ?
sure . when it happens to be my district . that &apos;s my job , Miss Lynn , to look at people .
I admit he looks as if he &apos;d do anything ... but at the time of the murder , he happened to be in Albany with me .
Frankie Christopher took you and your sister out for a ride the evening before the murder .
what happened on that ride ?
there &apos;s nothing important about that . Vicky was just imagining things .
- Like you ?
- I &apos;m not imagining anything ! I did see you !
all right . I &apos;m a Peeping Tom . now , about the ride ...
- Well , it &apos;s really so silly .
I hate to ... - Come on . let &apos;s have it .
Christopher just told me all about it , so you &apos;d better not withhold anything .
well , it was the night before Vicky was to leave for Hollywood .
Frankie came by to pick us up and take us for a ride .
we were driving along , not thinking much of anything , when ... ~ &#91; Humming &#93;
we &apos;ll be sorry to see you go , Vicky .
- No , you won &apos;t . you &apos;ll be glad .
- &#91; Frankie &#93; What ?
you &apos;ll be glad to get rid of me .
- Jill &apos;s in love with you . haven &apos;t you noticed ?
- Vicky , don &apos;t be silly .
I &apos;m not silly . I &apos;ve known it a long time .
she &apos;s tried to cover it up , but I &apos;ve known .
you &apos;re crazy . nothing like that &apos;s ever entered my head .
I know . it &apos;s much deeper than that .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s so dangerous . anything might happen .
let &apos;s go back now , shall we ?
now , she said to Christopher , &quot; You &apos;ll be glad to get rid of me . &quot;
- Is that it , word for word ? - Yes .
but she didn &apos;t mean anything like that !
what she meant we &apos;ll never know . it &apos;s what she said that counts .
now tell us how and when you found the body .
well , it was about 5 : 30 in the afternoon .
I &apos;d gotten away early from the office .
even as I came out of the elevator , I had a feeling something was wrong .
I don &apos;t know quite how to explain it , but there was music coming from the apartment , and ... ~ &#91; Popular &#93;
- Vicky !
- I just came in , just this second .
is she ?
Jill , you don &apos;t think I did it , do you ?
you don &apos;t , do you ?
~ &#91; Radio Switches Off &#93;
I &apos;m not quite clear on what happened after that .
the next thing I knew , the room was filled with police .
thank you very much , Miss Lynn . you &apos;ve been most helpful .
- I give up .
- Say , you fellas give up too easy .
how &apos; bout playing a couple games of gin rummy ?
exactly what did Vicky mean when she said , &quot; You &apos;ll be glad to get rid of me &quot; ?
- Where did you get that ?
- Never mind where I got it . what did she mean ?
- I don &apos;t know .
- I &apos;ll tell you what she meant .
she knew you resented her running out on you .
when you left those two fellas at the bar , you started to get drunk .
you drank all that night and the next day .
your mind became more and more inflamed ... until you were mad with jealousy and hurt pride .
I say you went up there and killed her in cold blood .
- That &apos;s not true !
- It is true !
I got a good mind to kill you myself right now !
- Take it easy , Ed ? take it easy .
- &#91; Panting &#93;
that &apos;s all for today , Frankie . sorry to bother you .
how &apos; bout a couple of tickets for the rodeo ?
you don &apos;t need any seats for the rodeo .
all you need &apos;s a couple more bulls in here , and you can have one of your own .
the assistant D.A. Wants to see Christopher in his office right away .
there you are , Frankie . you see ?
he probably wants to apologize .
&#91; Chuckles &#93;
thanks .
- What &apos;s the idea of riding him so hard ?
- I don &apos;t know .
I &apos;ve had 15 years &apos; experience in this racket .
if that isn &apos;t the look of a guilty man , I &apos;ll take the rap myself .
- Here he comes .
- What &apos;s the dope , Frankie ?
- Give us a break , will ya ?
- What &apos;d he say ?
- Sorry , boys . no statement .
- Allow me .
- What &apos;s the idea ?
- I hear Ed Cornell is taking charge of the investigation .
- That &apos;s right .
- Brother , when that guy says you &apos;re cooked , you &apos;re cooked .
he hasn &apos;t lost a conviction in his entire career .
here . pin the crepe on Cornell . his career is dead .
Mr. Christopher , I &apos;m terribly sorry if you &apos;ve been caused any inconvenience .
- I hope none of our men were too rough with you .
- No , no . not at all .
they &apos;ve been perfect little gentlemen .
the fact is , somebody has made a terrible mistake .
I was just explaining ... to Miss Lynn here that it seemed so logical that you were the guilty one .
- Doesn &apos;t it now ? - No .
I think we know the identity of the killer .
- A boy by the name of Harry Williams ... switchboard operator at the apartment house .
- Do you mind if I go now ?
- Not in the least , Miss Lynn .
sorry to have troubled you .
- Good-bye .
- Good-bye .
what makes you think Williams did it ?
we just got a call from one of our men . Williams has been missing since 5 : 30 last night .
he &apos;s probably hiding out somewhere , scared and shaky .
- But don &apos;t worry . - Well , you &apos;d better be quick about it ... because if I find him first , you &apos;re gonna have another murder on your hands .
Jill !
Jill , can &apos;t we be friends ?
this is a nice time to be thinking about that .
I &apos;m sorry you told that story about the car .
I couldn &apos;t help it . besides , it didn &apos;t mean anything anyway .
Vicky didn &apos;t know what she was saying . you know that , don &apos;t you ?
sure . may I take you home ?
no , thanks . I don &apos;t want any more reminders around than are necessary .
well , it &apos;s the first time I ever had a bad dream with my eyes open .
- What do you want ?
- Someday , you &apos;re gonna talk in your sleep ... and when that day comes , I wanna be around .
it &apos;s no use , Cornell . I &apos;m not the type .
- Have you got a warrant ?
- No . this is strictly my own idea .
- I &apos;m working on my own time .
- Then get out of here . I don &apos;t like rats in my bedroom .
now , wait . you don &apos;t seem to realize I &apos;m doing you a favor .
I &apos;m keeping you posted on the progress of this case .
for instance , I found this cigarette butt crushed out in her clothes closet .
there was also an evening slipper that had been stepped on ... as if somebody had waited there , hiding .
- Do you often smoke in clothes closets ?
- Not since I was a kid .
it happens to be your brand .
according to the latest statistics , 10 million people smoke that brand ... including the army and navy .
- Maybe it was a mass murder .
- I know it doesn &apos;t mean much by itself ... but every little bit counts .
when I get all my evidence together , I &apos;m gonna have you tied up ... like a pig in a slaughterhouse .
perhaps they &apos;re keeping it from you ... but they told me at headquarters that they think Harry Williams did it .
- I think they &apos;re wrong .
- Oh , I see .
they believe Williams did it , but you &apos;re the holdout .
- You &apos;re the bright boy . is that it ?
- Maybe .
you know , you &apos;re like something out of a museum .
you oughta have a magnifying glass and one of those trick hats with earflaps .
why don &apos;t you look in that box ?
- Collar buttons .
- That &apos;s right .
say , you &apos;re wonderful . you know , I think I &apos;ll carry you around just for laughs .
I don &apos;t mind the kidding .
you &apos;re a pretty cocky fellow , Frankie . you &apos;ve had your own way for a long time .
- First with Vicky Lynn and now with her sister .
- Get out of here .
find Harry Williams . and if I ever catch you around here again ... they &apos;ll have to pick you up with a sieve .
Hello , Harry .
- Hello , Miss Lynn .
- I thought you &apos;d gone away .
I just went over to Brooklyn to see my parents .
I didn &apos;t realize it would cause such a fuss . I explained everything to the cops .
- Oh . I thought ...
- Well , you shouldn &apos;t have thought that , Miss Lynn .
you know I wouldn &apos;t do a thing like that , don &apos;t you ?
Yes .
- I &apos;m moving . I &apos;ve come for Vicky &apos;s things .
- Yes . I know .
the superintendent told me you were coming .
I have everything here , all packed and ready to go .
- But who packed them ?
- I did .
well , you shouldn &apos;t have done that . you should &apos;ve gotten permission .
I wanted to help . I thought it might be of some help .
well , as long as you &apos;ve done it , thanks very much . will you help me carry them ?
&#91; switchboard Buzzing &#93;
Hello ?
just a minute . it &apos;s Mr. Christopher . he wants to speak to you .
tell him I &apos;m not in ; I &apos;ve gone away .
- She &apos;s not in . she &apos;s gone away .
- Where has she gone ?
he wants to know where you &apos;ve gone .
just tell him there &apos;s no forwarding address .
sorry . there &apos;s no forwarding address .
- Was the funeral nice ? - It was very quiet .
there wasn &apos;t anybody there except me .
- I wanted to come .
- Why didn &apos;t you ?
I didn &apos;t think it was my place .
&#91; whistles &#93;
- Good-bye , Miss Lynn .
- Thanks , Harry , for helping with the bags .
I don &apos;t want your money .
now , give me those reports on Robin Ray and Larry Evans in the Lynn case .
&#91; man On Speaker &#93; Yes , sir .
- Good morning , Chief .
- What do you want ?
- Nothing much .
- Then get out of here and get to work .
you &apos;re falling down on this case , Cornell . you haven &apos;t got a thing so far .
- I got my suspicions .
- Suspicions ? what good are suspicions without proof ?
now that Harry Williams is out of the running , we &apos;re no further along than we were .
I &apos;ll get something out of him ; just give me time .
- I thought you said Williams didn &apos;t do it .
- I &apos;m not talking about Williams .
- I &apos;m talking about Frankie Christopher .
- Christopher . Christopher !
all you talk about is Christopher . what about some of the others ?
that ham actor Robin Ray or Larry Evans , the newspaper columnist ?
let &apos;s sweat him .
better leave the newspaperman alone till you get something solid .
- He might give you a bad notice . - All right .
call in the actor .
- He couldn &apos;t kill mice .
- Did I ask for your opinion ?
bring in the actor now !
all right . I think you &apos;re wasting your time .
- Do you mind if I bring in Frankie Christopher too ?
- What do you want him for ?
- Have you got anything new ? - No .
I just like to have him around .
- Hello , Robin .
- Oh , hello , Christopher .
- What are you doing down here ?
- They asked me to come along .
I seem to be their favorite customer .
you know , it &apos;s perfectly ridiculous . I had nothing to do with this .
I just came down to be obliging .
how do they go about these things ?
what do they do to you ?
Oh , nothing much . it &apos;s sorta like playing handball , only you &apos;re the ball .
say , you should &apos;ve worn overalls .
- I &apos;m afraid you &apos;re gonna get that suit all messed up .
- Are you serious ?
- What do you think ?
- This way , boys .
&#91; Murmuring &#93;
follow me .
- No lights ?
- You &apos;re lucky .
go ahead . you &apos;re an actor . pretend you &apos;re going to your execution .
sit right over here , fellas .

let me out !
let me out of here !
take him up to my office .
there was something so young , so fresh , so full of life ... about Vicky that the very sight of her gave me new hope .
she made me feel that perhaps I might succeed again ... in both my life and my profession .
but when I told her that , she just laughed at me . she told me I was a has-been .
she said she was going places and didn &apos;t want to hitch her wagon ... to a ... a falling star .
I even arranged for a screen test for both of us .
a director I knew said he would give us a chance .
but when the day came , she went down there alone .
they decided they didn &apos;t need me .
well , I couldn &apos;t stand that . I went down there and started a row .
a few days later , when she sent for Christopher and Evans and me ...
I pretended to them that I knew nothing about it .
I pretended to myself that I didn &apos;t care .
but I ... I didn &apos;t kill her !
- Where were you on the day of the murder ?
- I was in the sanitarium ... on East 77th Street .
I go there occasionally when things get tough , and they take care of me .
- You can verify that if you like by calling the doctor .
- Check up on that .
I &apos;ve already checked . he was there , all right .
so there goes another one of your suspects .
- Is that all for today , gentlemen ?
- For today .
Hello , Frankie . I see they &apos;re still letting &apos; you out of here .
- I come and go as I please . they made me a trustee .
- Cornell must be slipping .
according to my calendar , you should be in the death house by now .
Uh-oh .
- Well , if it isn &apos;t Operator 13 .
- The nails for your coffin .
- Hi , Inspector .
- How about giving me a lift uptown , Frankie ?
sure . always glad to oblige a ghoul . right this way .

- Okay .
I &apos;m sorry to have to ask you to do this , but I &apos;m a little short on cash lately .
you see , I &apos;ve spent so much of my own dough trying to build up this case against you .
well , if there &apos;s anything you need , just let me know .
I imagine they &apos;ll make it right with me when I bring in the material for your trial .
they usually do in these cases . I nick a guy on my own time and send him up to the chair .
- Then I get back pay .
- Must be a great life .
like a garbageman , only with people .
I got practically all the evidence I need now .
I could arrest you today , for that matter , but you might get some smart mouthpiece ... and get off with life instead of the chair .
I won &apos;t be satisfied until I &apos;m sure it &apos;s the chair .
you &apos;re a gay dog , Cornell . you make me feel as if I &apos;m driving a hearse .
I know your type . I &apos;ve seen hundreds of &apos;em .
I don &apos;t scare you enough ... to make you commit suicide , but I worry you just the same .
and when the day comes , they all act different .
some scream . a few faint .
some light a cigarette and try a wisecrack ... but it sticks in their throats , especially when they &apos;re hung .
all right , Dracula . get your rotten corpse out of that seat .
- Thanks .
- Not at all .

good evening , Miss Lynn .
- What do you want ?
- I just wanna ask you a few questions .
you &apos;ve asked enough questions already . now , go away .
now , don &apos;t be like that , Miss Lynn .
you wanna find the man who killed your sister , don &apos;t you ?
- Of course .
- Maybe I can help you .
maybe you can help me . it &apos;s simply a matter of justice .
nice little place you got here .
the garden of hope . do you believe in hope , Miss Lynn ?
naturally . what &apos;s the good of living without hope ?
it can be done .
Miss Lynn , I got a hunch you know more than you &apos;re telling me .
- Especially about Frankie Christopher .
- That &apos;s not true .
I &apos;ve told you everything I know . what more could there be ?
if I knew , I wouldn &apos;t be asking , would I ?
now , listen . I know what you &apos;re going through . but justice is justice .
that guy is a sham , and he played your sister for a sucker .
when she tried to run out on him , he let her have it .
I don &apos;t believe that .
- You &apos;re in love with him , aren &apos;t you ?
- No , I &apos;m not !
Yes , you are .
your sister knew it , and I know it .
you &apos;re in love with him and trying to cover up his tracks , but it won &apos;t work .
I &apos;ll get him , with your help or without it .
I &apos;ve never been wrong yet . that man &apos;s guilty .
if you know what &apos;s good for you , you &apos;ll play along with me .
- Get out of here !
- You keep telling yourself he &apos;s innocent , don &apos;t you ?
but you &apos;re not certain . that &apos;s what &apos;s driving you crazy .
if you were certain , you wouldn &apos;t be holding out on me , would you ?
get out of here !
all right , Miss Lynn .
but think it over .
get me Mr. Frank Christopher . Columbus 46738 .
- Say , you look all right .
- Thanks .
- Where are we going ?
- Well , first of all , we &apos;re going to the fights .
Frankie , do you really think we should ?
why not ?

- I know , but ...

he &apos;s a great little kid . I raised him from a pup .

- Did you ever bring Vicky here ?
Nope . she wasn &apos;t interested .

- Taking it easy on the floor .

well , anyway , he was a great little fighter .
- I thought he was fine .
- It was that clumsy referee .
he &apos;s nearsighted . we only keep him on out of charity .
- Hello , Frankie . how are ya ?
- Hello , Gus . how &apos;s business ?
- Ah , so-so .
- I love this neighborhood .
I was brought up here .
I even miss the &quot; L. &quot; It used to sound like thunder .
- Did you ever bring Vicky down here ?
- No . Vicky liked the nightclubs .
I &apos;ve never been in a New York nightclub .
- What ?
- No .
see , I &apos;ve never known a man who had the cover charge .
lady , we &apos;re going to fix that right now .
- Pegasus Club .
- Yes , sir .
- Hi , Frankie .
- Hello . how &apos;s tricks ?
not so good . I still got that ringing in my head .
that &apos;s too bad . here . get yourself a big dinner and see what happens .
- Thanks , Frankie .
- He used to be a pretty good heavyweight ... but he &apos;s slaphappy now .
- Who &apos;s that ?
he always hears the bell in his head .
he seemed to know you were going to give him that money .
always do . I may be a has-been myself someday .
perhaps this isn &apos;t wise , Frankie . are you sure we oughta be seen together ?
I was never so sure of anything in my life .
~ &#91; Band &#93;
well , what do you know about that ?
pardon me , baby , while I go out and sink a battleship .
- Would you like to dance ?
- No , thanks .
I don &apos;t feel like dancing .
why did you suddenly call me tonight ?
it &apos;s very simple .
I was lonely ... and I thought you might possibly be lonely too .
- Is that all ?
- Of course .
you know , I &apos;m not sure I like being just another member of the Lonely Hearts Club .
you might do better by looking up the advertisements .
&quot; bachelor , $ 75,000 , with two glass eyes . &quot;
the trouble with you is you pretend you don &apos;t care about things , but you do .
you were very upset by Vicky &apos;s death , weren &apos;t you ?
sure . if I could find the guy who did it ...
I might save the state something on its electricity bill .
- She was a good kid .
- Did you love her ?
no . do you think if I had loved her ...
I would &apos;ve tried to exploit her the way I did ?
Vicky was pretty , gay and amusing .
she had lots to offer , and I wanted to put her in the right place on the map .
after all , that &apos;s my business .
but when a man really loves a woman ... he doesn &apos;t wanna plaster her face all over the papers and magazines .
he wants to keep her to himself , right in here .
&#91; Pats Chest &#93;
I never thought of that . I feel like dancing now .

scrap the stuff about the Japanese spy with a Kodak and run this :
&quot; what sister of what recently murdered girl ... is stepping out with the dead girl &apos;s boyfriend ?
dancing on the grave , I call it .
the murderer has yet to be found . &quot;
- You dance well .
- Vicky said I was terrible .
well , dancing ... It sort of depends .
Yes , I ... I know .
how &apos;d you like your first New York nightclub ?
Oh , it was wonderful . especially the dancing .
thanks . where would you like to go now ?
it &apos;s pretty late . where do you usually go ?
if I told you , you &apos;d laugh .
go ahead . I could use a good laugh .
- I go swimming .
- Swimming ?
where ?
the Lido Plunge .
you see , when I was a kid on the East Side ... it used to be the biggest adventure of my life ... whenever I could save up a quarter and go to the Lido .
I never got enough of it . so , now that I &apos;m in the chips ...
I go swimming every chance I get .
&#91; Chuckling &#93; Anyway , it &apos;s healthy .
if you &apos;ve got an extra quarter on you , I &apos;d like to go along .
- Are you kidding ?
- No .
you &apos;re on .
- Hello .
- Ouch . you hurt my eyes .
- Thanks , mister .
- Madame , could I interest you in a nice cold swim ?
funny , I was just going to ask you that .
swell . let &apos;s go .
well , how do you like the old swimming hole ?
- Wet and wonderful .
- This is my idea of real luxury .
you know , if I ever inherit a gold mine ...
I &apos;ll have a swimming pool in every room ... and you can swim in all of &apos;em .
do you tell that to every girl you bring down here ?
so help me , I never brought a girl here in my life !
- Hi , Frankie !
- Hello .
- Well , here we are .
- It &apos;s been a wonderful evening .
thanks . you &apos;ve been swell .
Frankie , will you come upstairs a minute ?
there &apos;s something of Vicky &apos;s I know she &apos;d want you to have .
sure .
it &apos;s a note you wrote to Vicky .
I found it among her things before the police arrived .
&quot; dear Vicky , after what you did last night ... the sooner you &apos;re out of the way &quot; ...
- Did I write that ?
- It &apos;s your signature .
well , it was after that ride together .
what she said , it ... it was so unfair to you .
I know what you meant , but I don &apos;t think anybody else would .
why didn &apos;t you turn this in ?
I didn &apos;t know until tonight .
it was when we were dancing .
I suddenly understood the letter and a lot of other things besides .
&#91; Cornell &#93; I &apos;d like to have a look at that letter , if you don &apos;t mind .
&quot; dear Vicky , after what you did last night ... the sooner you &apos;re out of the way , the better . &quot;
nice of you to put in writin &apos; .
all right , Murphy . you wait in the hall .
I knew you were holdin &apos; somethin &apos; back .
you &apos;re the Mona Lisa type . I can spot &apos; em a mile away .
- Oh !
- Jill !
- &#91; Door Slams &#93;
- Well , here we are , Frankie .
I &apos;ve looked forward to this moment for a long time .
- You &apos;re trying to frame me .
- I don &apos;t have to frame you .
you frame yourself . how about this little note ?
anybody might &apos;ve written a note like that . I was burned up .
well , you &apos;re gonna have plenty of time to cool off before I &apos;m through with you .
I found these in your room .
Exhibit &quot; A , &quot; one pair of brass knuckles .
and Vicky was hit behind the ear with a weapon the size of a fist , only much harder .
it &apos;s a frame . you &apos;re trying to frame me !
you planted those , you ... you ...
&#91; Groans &#93;
&quot; a frame . &quot; that &apos;s what they all say .
Murphy saw me take those knuckles from your bureau drawer .
&#91; Frankie &#93; Jill , you don &apos;t believe all this stuff , do you ?
what does it matter what she believes ? what does it matter what she believes ?
you &apos;re like a rat in a box without any holes .
well , they &apos;re gonna make a hole for you , Mr. Handsome Harry ... 6-by-3 , filled with quicklime ...
you shouldn &apos;t have done that , Jill . it makes you an accomplice .
quick , through the kitchen . there &apos;s a doorway leading to the hall .
go on . leave the cop to me .
quick , Officer !
he &apos;s trying to escape !
he went through the bedroom !
sorry for being so slow , but I don &apos;t do this sort of thing very often .
- You &apos;re going great .
- I hope the man doesn &apos;t mind our using his things .
I &apos;ll leave him a note of apology .
&#91; Sawing Continues &#93;
- You &apos;re a great sport , Jill .
- You &apos;re not so bad yourself .
- Why did you do it ?
- I don &apos;t know .
but when I saw you standing there so helpless and that big fathead bullying you ...
I just had to hit something .
is that the only reason ?
no .
I guess Vicky was right about us , wasn &apos;t she ?
- Glad ?
- &#91; Sawing Stops &#93;
what do you think ?
Frankie , we &apos;ve got to get out of this town as fast as we can .
are you sure you wanna go through with it ?
you know , it isn &apos;t very much fun being married to a hunted man .
I don &apos;t mind .
besides , most married men have a hunted look anyway .
Frank !
first thing we gotta do in the morning is get some money .
I &apos;ve got some laid away in a safe deposit box downtown .
- There &apos;ll be watching there , won &apos;t they ?
- Not this one .
I put it away under my original name .
&#91; mouths Words &#93; Frank , you &apos;re not really a crook , are you ?
of course not . I took the name Christopher because it &apos;s easy to spell .
- What &apos;s your real name ?
- I hate to tell you .
you &apos;ve got to tell me if I &apos;m gonna use it .
okay . Botticelli .
Botticelli . Mrs. Botticelli .
why , that &apos;s not bad at all .
what are we going to do in the meantime ?
I &apos;m going to show you how to play hide-and-seek in the big city .

I don &apos;t blame you . now , listen .
I want you to wait for me in the public library until I get the money .
- Why can &apos;t I come with you ?
- I think it &apos;s better that we separate for the time being .
- You &apos;ll be safer there .
- &#91; Scoffs &#93; What makes you think that &apos;s safe ?
nobody in their right mind is ever in a public library at 9 : 00 .
and if anything does go wrong , you meet me here .
- Now , be careful .
- All right .

- Never mind about that .

- Carrying a gun ?

it may be a gun or it may be a pipe .
then again , it may be just my finger .
but you &apos;re not taking any chances , are you ?
no . I don &apos;t have to .

each minute &apos;s an eternity to a man in your shoes .
you got the wrong steer this time , Cornell .
they told me at headquarters that you &apos;re a pretty sure thing .
but this time you &apos;re trying to convict an innocent man .
that &apos;s what you say , but you can &apos;t sell me on it .
I &apos;ll follow you into your grave . I &apos;ll write my name on your tombstone .
you &apos;re not a cop looking for a murderer .
you &apos;re crazy , Cornell . you ought to be put away .
sure . why don &apos;t you call a policeman ?
all right , Cornell . but I &apos;ll tell you one thing .
you &apos;re never going to convict me . you &apos;ll have to kill me first .
&#91; Scoffs &#93; I wouldn &apos;t kill anybody .
I &apos;m too smart . look . I don &apos;t even carry a gun .

- Hello , Chief .
- Hello .
got a lead on Christopher yet ?
did you ever read The Sex Life of the Butterfly by Faber ?
- Cornell , are you crazy ?
- &#91; Chuckles &#93; That &apos;s funny .
that &apos;s the second time I &apos;ve been asked that question tonight . have a Tootsie Roll .
what in blazes does The Sex Life of the Butterfly got to do with the Lynn case ?
Faber was a naturalist .
he got himself a very rare female butterfly from Africa worth 1,000 bucks .
he kept it in a glass box in his apartment in Paris .
but nobody had ever been able to catch the male of the species .
one day , he let the female out of the box ... and in a few hours , he had 10,000 dollars &apos; worth ... of rare African butterflies flying around the room .
very interesting . very interesting indeed !
but what &apos;s all this got to do with the Lynn case , may I ask ?
I want a release order for the girl .
just let her out of the box . nature will do the rest .
we &apos;ll have Frankie in the net by tomorrow .
Yeah , you may be right at that .
but if you slip up this time , Cornell ... it &apos;s curtains to a brilliant career .
you realize that , of course ?
sure . I realize that more than you do .

Oh , they would , so you could lead them right to me .
I wasn &apos;t a Campfire Girl for nothing . they think I &apos;m still in the apartment .
Yeah ?
well , we &apos;re getting out of town right now .
wait a minute . I found something .
these cards ... They were on the flowers that were sent to Vicky &apos;s funeral .
- Who were they from ?
- I don &apos;t know .
maybe we won &apos;t have to leave town after all .
you wait here .

good evening . I &apos;m sorry to bother you , but I &apos;m from the Evening Ledger .
they sent me out here on an assignment . may I come in ?
sure . sure . come in .
you know , I &apos;m glad to see anybody that &apos;s still moving around .
well , what can I do for you ?
I &apos;ve been assigned to write a human interest story on Vicky Lynn .
I was wondering whether you could help me .
any colorful or unusual ... little incident connected with the funeral , for instance .
Lynn , Lynn . let me see .
that &apos;s the girl was murdered up on 76th Street , isn &apos;t it ?
- That &apos;s right .
- Well , I don &apos;t know much I can tell you .
only thing ... We got our orders and laid her away the same as anybody else .
- Has anybody been out here since ?
- No .
- Were there many flowers at the funeral ?
- No . just the ...
wait a minute .
Lynn , Lynn . 266 .
say , that grave &apos;s been getting flowers every day since she died .
- Who &apos;d they come from ?
- I don &apos;t know .
never was any signature on the card .
just come regular from some florist around Times Square .
name Carting or Keating or something like that .
- Do you have a telephone directory ?
- Sure .
over there . help yourself .
I usually like to oblige newspaper people ... but in this case I &apos;m between two fires .
then the man who &apos;s been sending the flowers is also from a newspaper ?
well , in a way , yes , but he isn &apos;t a reporter .
- Does he write a column ?
- Well , I can &apos;t say that , can I ... or else I &apos;d give it away ?
thanks , Mr. Keating . I think I get your drift .
now , don &apos;t get me in any trouble .
- Who is it ?
- Your columnist friend .
&#91; Snoring &#93;

well , this is a pleasant surprise .
what &apos;s the idea of breaking into my place like this in the middle of the night ?
what do you know about the death of Vicky Lynn ?
you &apos;re a fine one to ask that . I know nothing about it .
then why have you been sending flowers to her grave every day ?
Oh , so you &apos;ve found out about that , have you ?
- I can explain that easily .
- Then go ahead .
- I promised her .
- Promised her ?
- Yes . mind if I smoke ?
- Not at all .
- You won &apos;t need that .
- I just thought I &apos;d try it .
it &apos;d be a great scoop for me if I could bring you in myself .
so you think I &apos;m guilty too ?
Yes , and so does everybody else .
what do you mean you promised to send Vicky flowers ?
well , the day of the murder , I had driven Vicky to the station to get her train reservations .
you mean you were with Vicky the afternoon she was killed ?
- Yes .
- Then why didn &apos;t you tell that to the police ?
because I &apos;m not a fool . you told the police your story .
- What &apos;d it get you ?
- Never mind that . go on .
when we got back to the apartment , she had forgotten her key .
she asked me if I had the one she gave me ... and I told her I had raffled it off .
Oh , dear , the passkey &apos;s gone too .
I guess there &apos;s nothing to do but sit and wait ... for the switchboard boy to get back .
from what I &apos;ve seen of that boy , he may be gone for hours .
I &apos;d better climb up the fire escape and let you in myself .
why , Larry , you &apos;d never do anything so gallant .
you don &apos;t know me .
- There you are , milady .
- Larry , you &apos;re so sweet .
you know , uh , now that I &apos;m leaving , I &apos;m really a little unhappy about it .
Oh , forget it .
if I weren &apos;t sure I &apos;d be a success , I &apos;d ... well , I &apos;d never do a thing like this .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;ll be a success . you &apos;ve got a heart made out of rock candy .
- You won &apos;t forget me , will you ?
- I won &apos;t for at least two weeks .
- Two weeks isn &apos;t very long , is it ?
- It is for a columnist .
I &apos;ll tell you what I &apos;ll do . for the first two weeks , I &apos;ll send you flowers every day .
it &apos;ll make a great impression where you &apos;re going .
Oh , Larry , will you really ?
- Promise ?
- I promise .
a promise is a promise .
I hope it still makes an impression ... wherever she is .
- I think it smells . what did you do after that ?
- I left .
was the boy at the switchboard when you came down ?
no . no , I remember the board was buzzing as I passed by .
did you notice anything unusual about the room when you went in ?
Yeah , now that you mention it . there seemed to be the smell of cigarette smoke in the air .
I thought maybe Jill had just left or ...
Jill was at the office .
good grief . you don &apos;t think he did it , do you ?
now , do you understand what you have to do ?
- Give me a half hour , then telephone him .
- Frankie , I &apos;m scared .
- Don &apos;t do it , please !
- This is the only chance I have .
I &apos;ve gotta take it .
good luck , dear .
hold still . I &apos;d hate to put a hole in you .
put that gun away , Frankie . we &apos;ve got enough against you as it is .
not until you &apos;ve heard me out . I got a lead on the real killer , but I need your help .
sorry , Frankie . I &apos;m on the other side of the fence .
okay , then . I &apos;ll make you a sporting proposition .
you trust me for just a half an hour , and I &apos;ll trust you .
well , I guess a half hour won &apos;t do any harm .
- But I &apos;ll take that just in case .
- Come on .

go away !

you let yourself in with your passkey and waited for her in the apartment .
when Evans came through the window to let her in , you hid in the closet .
after he left , you came out . you tried to grab her , and she screamed .
- You became frightened and killed her .
- I didn &apos;t know what I was doin &apos; .
I swear . she screamed , and I lost my head !
sure . sure , I understand .
- Do ya ? do ya ?
- Sure .
I told a cop how it was when he traced me to Brooklyn .
he said he understood too .
so he told me just to come back here and keep quiet , and he &apos;d forget all about it .
- What cop ?
- Why , the big one .
- Ed Cornell ? - That &apos;s the one .
did you hear that , Mac ?
Cornell knew I was innocent all the time .

Hello , Cornell .
I hope you don &apos;t mind my breaking in on you like this .
have you come to give yourself up ?
I don &apos;t have to . I just had a long talk with Harry Williams .
that must have been very enlightening .
Yes . very enlightening .
I &apos;m a sick man , Frankie .
- At your soul , Cornell .
- Maybe .
you knew Williams was the one that killed Vicky all the time .
- Sure . I &apos;m not dumb .
- You knew it , and yet you wanted to fry me .
- That &apos;s right .
why didn &apos;t you go after Williams ?
he was the one that killed her .
I lost Vicky long before Williams killed her .
you were the one who took her away from me , not him .
don &apos;t make me laugh !
Yeah .
I guess it must seem funny to you ... a worm like me looking up to a woman like that .
I followed her around for months before I got up enough courage to speak to her .
I used to hang around the restaurant at night ... to see that she got home all right .
then finally , I got a chance to help her .
it was New Year &apos;s Eve .
two guys tried to get fresh with her , so I stepped in .
she seemed ... really grateful and ...
we had a cup of coffee together .
I saw her several times after that , and it was always the same .
she took me on my own ground .
then I started to hope that we might get to know each other better ... that I might even get up enough courage to ask her to ... marry me someday .
I ... took this apartment ... started to furnish it .
bought the perfume she liked .
I intended to surprise her with it .
then you came along with your grand plans of makin &apos; somethin &apos; of her !
puttin &apos; ideas into her head that she was a glamour girl and all that kind of stuff !
why didn &apos;t you leave her alone ?
she started gettin &apos; too good for me .
I felt like a fool with this apartment .
I could &apos;ve killed you then , Christopher .
why didn &apos;t you ?
because I had the hook in your mouth , and I wanted to see you suffer .
well , it &apos;s all over now , Cornell . you &apos;re going to be put away .
Yeah , but not where you think .
the guy who sold me this medicine ... told me it would cure everything .
&#91; Jill &#93; Frankie !
Frankie , are you all right ?
Yeah , I &apos;m all right .
come on . let &apos;s get outta here .
~ &#91; Band &#93;
Robin , I ...
why , who on earth is that beautiful girl ?
Mrs. Botticelli .
- I never saw her before in my life .
- I don &apos;t know either .
they &apos;re both strangers to me .
Yes , sweetheart ?
there &apos;s a girl wants to see you .
her name &apos;s Wonderly .
a customer ? I guess so . you &apos;ll want to see her , anyway .
she &apos;s a knockout . shoo her in , Effie , darling .
will you come in , Miss Wonderly ?
won &apos;t you sit down , Miss Wonderly ?
thank you . I inquired at the hotel for the name of a reliable private detective .
they mentioned yours .
suppose you tell me about it from the very beginning .
I &apos;m from New York . I &apos;m trying to find my sister .
I have reason to believe that she &apos;s here in San Francisco with a man by the name of Thursby , Floyd Thursby .
I don &apos;t know where she met him .
we &apos;ve never been as close as sisters ought to be .
if we had , perhaps Corinne would have told me that she was planning on running away with him .
mother and Father are in Honolulu . it would kill them .
I &apos;ve got to find her before they get back home .
they &apos;re coming home the first of the month . you &apos;ve had word of your sister ?
a letter from her about two weeks ago .
it said nothing except that she was all right .
I sent her a telegram , begging her to come home .
I sent it to General Delivery here .
that was the only address she gave me .
I waited a week and no answer came , so I decided to come out here myself .
I wrote her that I was coming . I shouldn &apos;t have done that , should I ?
it &apos;s not always easy to know what to do .
you haven &apos;t found her ? no . I told her in my letter that I &apos;d be at the St. Mark and for her to meet me there .
I waited three whole days .
she didn &apos;t come .
didn &apos;t even send a message . it was horrible , waiting .
I sent her another letter to General Delivery .
yesterday afternoon , I went to the post office .
Corinne didn &apos;t call for her mail , but Floyd Thursby did .
he wouldn &apos;t tell me where Corinne was .
he said she didn &apos;t want to see me .
I can &apos;t believe that .
he promised to bring her to the hotel , if she &apos;d come , this evening .
he said he knew she wouldn &apos;t . he promised to come himself if she didn &apos;t .
excuse me .
it &apos;s all right , Miles .
come in . Miss Wonderly , my partner , Miles Archer .
Miss Wonderly &apos;s sister ran away from New York with a fellow named Floyd Thursby .
they &apos;re here in San Francisco .
Miss Wonderly has seen Thursby and has a date to meet him tonight .
maybe he &apos;ll bring the sister with him .
the chances are he won &apos;t . Miss Wonderly wants us to find the sister , get her away from him and back home .
right ?
now , it &apos;s simply a matter of having a man at the hotel this evening to shadow him when he leads us to your sister .
if , after we &apos;ve found her , she still doesn &apos;t want to leave him , well , we have ways of managing that .
Yeah . but you must be careful .
I &apos;m deathly afraid of him , of what he might do .
she &apos;s so young , and his bringing her here from New York is such a serious ...
Mightn &apos;t he do something to her ?
now , just leave that to us . we &apos;ll know how to handle him .
but I want you to know he &apos;s a dangerous man .
I honestly don &apos;t think he &apos;d stop at anything .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;d hesitate to kill Corinne if he thought it would save him .
could he cover up by marrying her ?
he has a wife and three children in England .
Yes , they usually do , though not always in England .
what &apos;s he look like ? he has dark hair and thick , bushy eyebrows .
he talks in a loud , blustery manner .
he gives the impression of being a violent person .
he was wearing a light gray suit and a gray hat when I saw him this morning .
what does he do for a living ?
I haven &apos;t the faintest idea .
what time &apos;s he coming to see you ?
after 8 : 00 . all right , Miss Wonderly . we &apos;ll have a man there .
I &apos;ll look after it myself .
thank you .
Oh , yes .
will that be enough ?
thank you .
it &apos;ll help some if you meet Thursby in the lobby .
I will . you don &apos;t have to look for me .
I &apos;ll see you all right .
thank you .
thank you so much .
they &apos;re right enough .
they have brothers in her bag .
what do you think of her ?
she &apos;s sweet .
maybe you saw her first , Sam , but I spoke first .
you &apos;ve got brains .
Yes , you have .
Hello ?
Yeah .
miles Archer dead ?
where ?
bush and Stockton ?
Yeah .
in 15 minutes .
thanks .
Hello , Effie ?
it &apos;s me .
now , listen , precious .
miles has been shot .
Yeah , dead .
now , don &apos;t get excited .
Yeah .
now , you &apos;ll have to break the news to Iva .
I &apos;d fry first . and keep her away from me .
that &apos;s a good girl .
now get right over there .
you &apos;re an angel .
Bye .
what do you want here ?
I &apos;m Sam Spade . Tom Polhaus phoned .
I didn &apos;t know you at first . they &apos;re back there .
Hello , Sam .
I figured you &apos;d want to see it before we took him away .
thanks , Tom .
what happened ?
got him right through the pump with this .
it &apos;s a Webley .
English , ain &apos;t it ?
Yeah . a Webley Fosbery .45 automatic , 8 shot .
they don &apos;t make them anymore .
how many gone out of it ?
just one . let &apos;s see . shot up here , huh ?
standing like you are , with his back to the fence .
the man who shot him stood here .
went over backwards , taking the top of the fence with him , and went on down the hill and got caught on that rock .
that it ? that &apos;s it . the blast burnt his coat .
who found him ?
man on the beat .
anybody hear the shot ?
somebody must &apos;ve .
we just got here .
you want to go down and have a look at him before we take him away ?
no , you &apos;ve seen everything I could .
his gun was still tucked away on his hip . hadn &apos;t been fired .
his overcoat was buttoned .
I found a $ 100 bill in his vest pocket and 30 some bucks in his pants .
was he working , Sam ?
well ?
he was tailing a guy named Thursby .
what for ?
he wanted to find out where he lived .
don &apos;t crowd me , Tom .
I &apos;m going on down and break the news to Miles &apos; wife .
it &apos;s tough , him getting it like that , ain &apos;t it ?
miles had his faults , just like any of the rest of us , but I guess he must &apos;ve had some good points , too , huh ?
I guess so .
Miss Wonderly , please .
checked out ?
what time ?
any forwarding address ?
thanks .
Hello , Tom .
Hello , Lieutenant .
sit down .
sit down .
drink ?
did you break the news to Miles &apos; wife , Sam ?
how &apos;d she take it ?
I don &apos;t know anything about women .
since when ? what kind of a gun do you carry ?
none . I don &apos;t like them .
course , there are some at the office .
you don &apos;t happen to have one here ?
you sure about that ?
look around . turn the dump upside down if you want to .
I won &apos;t squawk if you got a search warrant .
we don &apos;t want to make any ...
I don &apos;t like this !
why are you birds sucking around here for ?
tell me or get out . you can &apos;t treat us like that , Sam .
it ain &apos;t right . we got our work to do .
why were you tailing Thursby ?
I wasn &apos;t . miles was and for the simple reason we had a client ...
who &apos;s the client ?
sorry , I can &apos;t tell you that .
be reasonable , Sam .
give us a break , will you ?
how we gonna turn up anything on Miles &apos; killing if you don &apos;t tell us what you got ?
Tom says you were in too much of a hurry to even stop and take a look at your dead partner .
and you didn &apos;t go to Archer &apos;s house to tell his wife .
we called your office and the girl there said you told her to do it .
I &apos;ll give you 10 minutes to get to a phone and do your talking to the girl .
I &apos;ll give you 10 minutes to get to Thursby &apos;s joint ,
Geary and Leavenworth .
you could do it easily in that time .
what &apos;s your boyfriend getting at , Tom ?
just this , Thursby was shot down in front of his hotel about a half an hour after you left Bush Street .
keep your paws off me .
what time did you get home ?
just a few minutes ahead of you .
I was walking around thinking things over .
we know you weren &apos;t here .
we tried to get you on the phone .
where did you walk to ?
up Bush Street .
did you see anybody ...
no . no witnesses .
well , I know where I stand , now .
sorry I got up on my hind legs , boys , but you fellas trying to rope me made me nervous .
miles getting bumped off upset me , and then you birds cracking foxy .
but it &apos;s all right now , now that I know what it &apos;s all about .
forget it , Sam .
Thursby die ? Yeah .
how &apos;d I kill him ?
I forget .
he was shot in the back four times with a .44 or .45 from across the street .
nobody saw it , but that &apos;s how it figures .
hotel people know anything about him ?
nothing , except that he lived there a week .
alone ?
Yeah , alone .
did you find out who he was ?
what his game was ? well , did you ?
we thought you could tell us that .
I &apos;ve never seen Thursby , dead or alive .
well , you know me , Spade .
if you did it , or if you didn &apos;t , you &apos;ll get a square deal from me and most of the breaks .
don &apos;t know as I &apos;d blame you much .
the man that killed your partner ...
but that won &apos;t stop me from nailing you .
fair enough .
but I &apos;d feel better about it if you &apos;d have a drink with me .
success to crime .
she &apos;s in there .
I told you to keep her away from me .
Yes , but you didn &apos;t tell me how .
don &apos;t be cranky with me , Sam .
I &apos;ve had her all night .
sorry , angel .
I didn &apos;t mean ...
Hello , Iva .
Sam .
darling .
Effie take care of everything ?
I think so .
Sam , did you kill him ?
who put that bright idea in your head ?
well , I thought you said if it wasn &apos;t for Miles , you &apos;d ...
be kind to me , Sam .
&quot; you killed my husband , Sam .
be kind to me . &quot;
don &apos;t , Iva . don &apos;t .
you shouldn &apos;t have come here today , darling .
you ought to be home .
you &apos;ll come soon ?
soon as I can .
Goodbye , Iva .
well , how did you and the widow make out ?
she thinks I shot Miles .
so you could marry her ?
the cops think I killed Thursby , the guy Miles was tailing for that Wonderly dame .
who do you think I shot ?
are you going to marry Iva ?
don &apos;t be silly . I wish I &apos;d never laid eyes on her .
do you suppose she could have killed him ?
you &apos;re an angel .
a nice , rattlebrained , little angel .
Oh , am I ?
thanks , honey .
suppose I told you that your Iva hadn &apos;t been home many minutes when I arrived to break the news at 3 : 00 this morning ?
are you telling me ?
she kept me waiting at the door while she undressed .
her clothes were on a chair where she &apos;d dumped them , hat and coat underneath .
her slip , on top , was still warm .
she &apos;d wrinkled up the bed , but the wrinkles weren &apos;t mashed down .
you &apos;re a detective , darling , but she didn &apos;t kill him .
do the police really think you shot this what &apos;s his name ?
do they ? look at me , Sam .
you worry me .
you always think you know what you &apos;re doing , but you &apos;re too slick for your own good .
someday you &apos;re going to find it out . Spade and Archer .
Yes , Miss Wonderly .
Hello ?
Yeah , this is Sam Spade .
where ?
Coronet Apartments , California Avenue , apartment 1001 .
what &apos;s the name ?
Miss LeBlanc .
okay , I &apos;ll be right over .
have Miles &apos; desk moved out of the office and have &quot; Spade and Archer &quot; taken off all the doors and windows and have &quot; Samuel Spade &quot; put on .
come in , Mr. Spade .
everything &apos;s upside down .
I haven &apos;t finished unpacking .
Mr. Spade , I ...
I have a terrible , terrible confession to make .
that story I told you yesterday was just a story .
Oh , that .
well , we didn &apos;t exactly believe your story , Miss ...
what is your name , Wonderly or LeBlanc ?
it &apos;s really O &apos;Shaughnessy . Brigid O &apos;Shaughnessy .
we didn &apos;t exactly believe your story , Miss O &apos;Shaughnessy .
we believed your $ 200 .
you mean that ...
I mean you paid us more than if you &apos;d been telling us the truth and enough more to make it all right .
tell me , Mr. Spade , am I to blame for last night ?
you warned us that Thursby was dangerous .
of course , you lied to us about your sister and all that , but that didn &apos;t count .
we didn &apos;t believe you .
no , I wouldn &apos;t say that you were at fault .
thank you .
Mr. Archer was so alive yesterday , so solid and hearty , and ...
stop it .
he knew what he was doing .
those are the chances we take .
was he married ?
Yeah , with $ 10,000 insurance , no children and a wife that didn &apos;t like him .
please don &apos;t .
that &apos;s the way it was .
anyway , there &apos;s no time for worrying about that now .
out there &apos;s a flock of policemen and assistant district attorneys running around with their noses to the ground .
Mr. Spade , do they know about me ?
not yet .
I &apos;ve been stalling them until I could see you .
do they have to know about me ?
I mean , can &apos;t you shield me so that I won &apos;t have to answer their questions ?
maybe , but I gotta know what it &apos;s all about .
I can &apos;t tell you .
I can &apos;t tell you now .
I will later , when I can .
you &apos;ve got to trust me , Mr. Spade .
I &apos;m so alone and afraid .
I &apos;ve got nobody to help me if you won &apos;t help me .
be generous , Mr. Spade .
you &apos;re brave . you &apos;re strong .
you can spare me some of that courage and strength , surely .
help me , Mr. Spade . I need help so badly .
I have no right to ask you . I know I haven &apos;t , but I do ask you .
help me .
you won &apos;t need much of anybody &apos;s help .
you &apos;re good .
it &apos;s chiefly your eyes , I think , and that throb you get in your voice when you say things like , &quot; Be generous , Mr. Spade . &quot;
I deserve that .
but the lie was in the way I said it , not at all in what I said .
it &apos;s my own fault if you can &apos;t believe me now .
now you are dangerous .
but I &apos;m afraid I &apos;m not going to be able to be of much help to you unless I &apos;ve got some idea what it &apos;s all about .
for instance , I &apos;ve gotta have some sort of a line on your Floyd Thursby .
I met him in the Orient .
we came here from Hong Kong last week . he promised to help me .
he took advantage of my dependence on him to betray me .
betray you ?
how ? why did you want him shadowed ?
I wanted to find out how far he &apos;d gone , whom he was meeting , things like that .
did he kill Archer ? certainly .
he had a Luger in his shoulder holster . Archer wasn &apos;t shot with a Luger .
Mr. Spade , you don &apos;t think I had anything to do with the death of Mr. Archer ?
did you ?
no .
that &apos;s good .
Floyd always carried an extra revolver in his overcoat pocket .
why all the guns ?
he lived by them .
the story in Hong Kong is that he first came to the Orient as bodyguard to a gambler who &apos;d had to leave the States .
the gambler had since disappeared , and Floyd knew about the disappearance .
I don &apos;t know .
I do know he always went heavily armed , and that he never went to sleep without covering the floor around his bed with crumpled newspapers so that nobody could come silently into his room .
you picked a nice sort of a playmate .
only that sort could have helped me , if he &apos;d been loyal .
how bad a spot are you actually in ?
bad as could be .
physical danger ?
I &apos;m not heroic . I don &apos;t think there &apos;s anything worse than death .
then it &apos;s that ?
it &apos;s that , as surely as we &apos;re sitting here .
unless you help me .
who killed Thursby , your enemies or his ?
I don &apos;t know .
his , I suppose .
I &apos;m afraid . I don &apos;t know .
this is hopeless .
I don &apos;t know what you want done .
I don &apos;t even know if you know what you want done .
you won &apos;t go to the police ? go to them ?
all I got to do is stand still , and they &apos;ll be swarming all over me .
all right , I &apos;ll tell them all I know , and you &apos;ll have to take your chances .
you &apos;ve been patient with me . you &apos;ve tried to help me .
it &apos;s useless and hopeless , I suppose .
I do thank you for what you &apos;ve done .
I &apos;ll have to take my chances .
how much money have you got ?
I &apos;ve got about $ 500 left .
give it to me .
there &apos;s only $ 400 here .
I had to keep some to live on .
well , can &apos;t you get some more ?
no . haven &apos;t you got anything you can raise some money on ?
I &apos;ve got some furs and a little jewelry .
you &apos;ll have to hock them .
there you are .
I &apos;ll be back as soon as I can with the best news I can manage .
I &apos;ll ring four times , long , short , long , short .
and no , you needn &apos;t bother to come to the door .
I &apos;ll let myself in .
anything stirring ?
did you send the flowers ?
you &apos;re invaluable , darling .
say , get my lawyer on the phone , will you ?
Hello , Sid ?
I think I &apos;m going to have to tell a coroner to go to blazes , Sid .
Hey , can I hide behind the sanctity of my client &apos;s identity , secrets and what nots all the same , priest or lawyer ?
Yeah , I know , but Dundy &apos;s getting a little rambunctious , and maybe it is a bit thick this time .
Yeah . what &apos;ll it cost to be on the safe side ?
well , maybe it &apos;s worth it .
okay , go ahead .
gardenia .
quick , darling , in with him .
will you come in , Mr. Cairo ?
will you sit down , Mr. Cairo ?
thank you , sir .
now , what can I do for you , Mr. Cairo ?
may a stranger offer condolences for your partner &apos;s unfortunate death ?
thanks .
is there , Mr. Spade , as the newspapers imply , a certain relationship between that unfortunate happening and the death a little later of the man Thursby ?
I beg your pardon . no .
more than idle curiosity prompted my question .
see , Mr. Spade , I &apos;m trying to recover an ornament that , shall we say , has been mislaid .
I thought and hoped you could assist me .
the ornament is a statuette , a black figure of a bird .
I am prepared to pay , on behalf of the figure &apos;s rightful owner , the sum of $ 5,000 for its recovery .
I am prepared to promise that , what is the phrase ?
no questions will be asked .
$ 5,000 is a lot of money .
Yes , Effie ?
no , that &apos;ll be all .
just be sure to lock the door behind you on your way out .
good night .
$ 5,000 is ...
you will clasp your hands together at the back of your neck .
I intend to search your offices , Mr. Spade .
I warn you , if you attempt to prevent me , I shall certainly shoot you .
go ahead and search .
will you please come to the center of the room ?
I have to make certain that you are not armed .
passport Joel Cairo
French REPUBLIC PASSPORT
look what you did to my shirt .
sorry .
but imagine my embarrassment when I found out that $ 5,000 offer was just hooey .
Mr. Spade , my offer is genuine .
I am prepared to pay $ 5,000 for the figure &apos;s return .
do you have it ?
but if it isn &apos;t here , why did you risk serious injury to prevent my searching for it ?
why should I sit around here and let people come in and stick me up ?
but certainly it is only natural that I try to save the owner such a considerable expense , if possible .
who is he ?
Mr. Spade , you &apos;ll forgive my not answering that question .
Yeah , well , I think we &apos;d be better off all around if we &apos;d put our cards on the table .
no , I do not think it would be better .
you see , Mr. Spade , if you know more than I do , then I shall profit by your knowledge .
so will you , to the extent of $ 5,000 .
there &apos;s nothing like $ 5,000 here .
you want some assurance of my sincerity ?
a retainer ?
would that do ?
it might .
you will take , say , $ 100 ?
no .
I will take , say , $ 200 .
now , let &apos;s see , your first guess was that I had the bird .
there &apos;s nothing to that .
what &apos;s your second guess ?
that you know where it is , or at least you know it is where you can get it .
you &apos;re not hiring me to do any murders or burglaries , but simply to get it back if possible , in an honest , lawful way ?
if possible .
but in any case , with discretion .
when you wish to contact me , sir , I &apos;m staying at the Hotel Belvedere , room 635 .
I sincerely expect the greatest mutual benefit from our association , Mr. Spade .
may I please have my gun , now ?
Oh , sure . I &apos;d forgotten all about it .
will you please clasp your hands together at the back of your neck ?
I intend to search your offices .
well , I &apos;ll be ...
why , sure .
go ahead . I won &apos;t stop you .
turn to the right and go up the hill , driver . okay .
Mr. Spade .
do you bring any news ?
I mean , did you manage it so that the police won &apos;t have to know about me ?
well , they won &apos;t for a while , anyway .
you are wonderful . you won &apos;t get into any trouble , will you ?
I don &apos;t mind a reasonable amount of trouble .
do sit down .
you aren &apos;t exactly the sort of a person you pretend to be , are you ?
why , I &apos;m not sure I know exactly what you mean .
the schoolgirl manner . you know , blushing , stammering and all that .
I haven &apos;t lived a good life .
worse than you could know .
Yeah , well , that &apos;s good , because if you actually were as innocent as you pretend to be , we &apos;d never get anywhere .
I won &apos;t be innocent .
by the way , I saw Joel Cairo tonight .
do you know him ?
only slightly .
you &apos;re good . you &apos;re very good .
what did he say ?
about what ?
about me .
nothing . what did you talk about then ?
he offered me $ 5,000 for the black bird .
you &apos;re not going to go around the room straightening things and poking the fire again , are you ?
no , I &apos;m not .
what did you say ?
I said $ 5,000 was a lot of money .
it is .
it &apos;s more than I can ever offer you if I have to bid for your loyalty .
that &apos;s good coming from you .
what have you ever given me beside money ?
you ever given me any of your confidence , any of the truth ?
haven &apos;t you tried to buy my loyalty with money and nothing else ?
what else is there I can buy you with ?
I don &apos;t care what your secrets are , but I can &apos;t go ahead without more confidence in you than I &apos;ve got now .
you &apos;ve got to convince me that you know what this is all about , that you aren &apos;t just fiddling around , hoping it &apos;ll all come out right in the end .
can &apos;t you trust me a little longer ?
how much is a little ?
what are you waiting for ?
I &apos;ve got to talk to Joel Cairo .
you can see him tonight . he &apos;s at the theater .
it &apos;ll be out soon .
I &apos;ll leave a message at his hotel .
he can &apos;t come here .
I can &apos;t let him know where I am . I &apos;m afraid .
my place , then .
Hello ?
I want to leave a message for Joel Cairo .
all right .
you know , I never would &apos;ve placed myself in this position if I didn &apos;t trust you completely .
that again ?
do you know that &apos;s true , though ?
you don &apos;t have to trust me , so long as you can persuade me to trust you .
but don &apos;t worry about that now .
he &apos;ll be along any minute .
you get your business with Cairo over with , then we &apos;ll see how we stand .
and you &apos;ll let me go about it with him in my own way ?
sure .
you are a godsend .
well , now don &apos;t overdo it .
Mr. Spade , there is a boy outside . he seems to be watching the house .
Yeah , I know .
I spotted him .
what ?
what &apos;s that ? what boy ?
I don &apos;t know . a kid . he &apos;s been trailing me all evening .
did he follow you to my apartment ? no .
I shook him long before that .
come in , Mr. Cairo .
I &apos;m delighted to see you again , madam .
I was sure you would be , Joel .
Mr. Spade told me about your offer for the Falcon .
how soon can you have the money ready ?
the money is ready .
in cash ?
Yes .
you &apos;re ready to pay $ 5,000 if we turn over the Falcon to you ?
excuse me , please .
I must have expressed myself badly .
I did not mean to say that I have the money in my pocket , but that I am ready to get it for you on a few minutes &apos; notice , anytime during banking hours .
that &apos;s probably true .
he only had a couple of hundred on him when I searched him late this afternoon at my office .
I shall be able to have the money for you at , say , 10 : 30 in the morning .
but I haven &apos;t got the Falcon .
I &apos;ll have it in another week at the most , though .
then where is it ?
where Floyd hid it .
Floyd hid ...
and you know where he hid it ?
then why do we have to wait a week ?
perhaps not a whole week .
and why , if I may ask another question , are you willing to sell it to me ?
because I &apos;m afraid .
after what happened to Floyd , I &apos;m afraid to touch it , except to turn it over to somebody else .
what exactly did happen to Floyd ?
the fat man .
fat man .
is he here ? I don &apos;t know .
I suppose so .
what difference does it make ?
it might make a world of difference .
but , shall we add , more certainly the boy outside ?
precisely . Yes .
but you might be able to get around him , Joel , as you did the one in Istanbul .
what was his name ?
you mean the one you couldn &apos;t get to come to ...
this is the second time that you have laid hands on me .
when you &apos;re slapped , you &apos;ll take it and like it .
who &apos;s that ?
I don &apos;t know . keep quiet .
Hello .
you guys pick swell hours to do your visiting in . what is it this time ?
we want to talk to you , Spade .
well , go ahead and talk .
we don &apos;t have to do it out here in the hall , do we , Sam ?
you can &apos;t come in .
come off it now , Sam .
you aren &apos;t trying to strong arm me , are you , Tom ?
why don &apos;t you be reasonable ?
it would pay you to play along with us a little , Spade .
you got away with this , and you got away with that , but you can &apos;t keep it up forever .
stop me when you can .
that &apos;s what I intend to do .
there &apos;s talk going around about you and Archer &apos;s wife .
is there anything to it ?
not a thing .
the talk is that she tried to get a divorce from him so she could put in with you , and he wouldn &apos;t give it to her .
anything to that ?
no . there &apos;s even talk that that &apos;s why he was put on the spot .
don &apos;t be a hog , Dundy .
your first idea that I killed Thursby because he killed Miles falls to pieces if you blame me for killing Miles , too .
you haven &apos;t heard me say you killed anybody .
you &apos;re the one that keeps bringing that up .
haven &apos;t you anything better to do than to keep popping in here early every morning , asking a lot of fool questions ?
and getting a lot of lying answers .
take it easy .
if you say there &apos;s nothing between you and Archer &apos;s wife , you &apos;re a liar and I &apos;m telling you so .
is that the hot tip that brought you up here at this ungodly hour of the night ?
that &apos;s one of them .
and the other ?
let us in .
all right , Spade , we &apos;ll go .
maybe you &apos;re right in bucking us . think it over .
help !
I guess we &apos;re going in .
I guess you are .
what &apos;s going on in here ?
look , Officer !
look what she did !
did you do that ?
I had to . I was alone in here with him . he tried to attack me .
I had to keep him off .
I couldn &apos;t bring myself to shoot him .
you dirty , filthy liar !
you ...
it isn &apos;t true !
I came up here in good faith , and then both of them attacked me .
and then when he went out to talk to you , he left her here with a pistol .
and she said as soon as you leave , they are going to kill me , so I called for help because I didn &apos;t want you to leave me and be murdered .
and then she struck me with a pistol !
why don &apos;t you make him tell the truth ?
behave yourself , sister .
that &apos;s no way to act .
well , Tom , I don &apos;t guess we &apos;ll be wrong running the lot of them in .
don &apos;t be in a hurry , boys . everything can be explained .
I &apos;ll bet .
Miss O &apos;Shaughnessy , may I present
Lieutenant Dundy and Detective Sergeant Polhaus ?
Miss O &apos;Shaughnessy is an operative in my employ since yesterday .
that &apos;s a lie , too .
that is Mr. Joel Cairo .
Cairo was an acquaintance of Thursby &apos;s .
he came into my office late this afternoon and hired me to find something that Thursby was supposed to have on him when he was bumped off .
it looked funny to me the way he put it , so I wouldn &apos;t touch it .
then he pulled a gun on me .
well , that &apos;s neither here nor there , unless we start preferring charges against each other .
anyway , Miss O &apos;Shaughnessy and I discussed the matter , and we decided to find out exactly how much he knew about Miles &apos; and Thursby &apos;s killings , so we asked him to come up here .
now , maybe we did put the questions to him a little roughly .
you know how that is , Lieutenant .
but we didn &apos;t hurt him enough to make him cry for help .
well , what have you got to say to that ?
I don &apos;t know what to say .
try telling the facts .
what ? facts ?
quit stalling .
all you have to do is swear out a complaint they took a poke at you , and I &apos;ll throw them in the can .
go ahead , Cairo .
tell him , he &apos;ll do it .
then we &apos;ll swear out a complaint against you , and he &apos;ll have the lot of us .
get your hats .
well , boys and girls , we put it over nicely .
go on , get your hats .
don &apos;t you know when you &apos;re being kidded ?
no , but that can wait till we get down to the hall .
wake up , Dundy , you &apos;re being kidded .
when I heard the buzzer , I said to Miss O &apos;Shaughnessy and Cairo here ,
I said , &quot; There &apos;s the police again .
they &apos;re getting to be a nuisance .
&quot; when you hear them going , one of you scream ,
&quot; and then we &apos;ll see how far along we can string them until they tumble . &quot;
stop it , Sam !
that cut on his head . how did that get there ? ask him .
maybe he cut himself shaving .
the cut ? no .
when we pretended to be struggling for the gun , I fell over the carpet .
I fell .
Horsefeathers .
take him along , anyway , for packing a gun .
don &apos;t be a sap .
that gun was a plant .
it was one of mine .
it &apos;s too bad it was only a .25 , or maybe you could prove that was the gun that Miles and Thursby were shot with .
no , Sam ! no !
well , then get him out of here .
get their names and addresses .
my name is Joel Cairo , Hotel Belvedere .
Miss O &apos;Shaughnessy &apos;s address is my office .
where do you live ?
get him out of here !
I &apos;ve had enough ...
now , now . take it easy , will you , Sam ?
is that all you want , Lieutenant ?
Yeah . I think I &apos;ll be going now .
what &apos;s the hurry , Cairo ?
there is no hurry .
it &apos;s getting quite late , and ...
tell him to leave the gun .
I hope you know what you &apos;re doing , Sam .
you &apos;re absolutely the wildest , most unpredictable person I &apos;ve ever known .
do you always carry on so highhanded ?
well , you &apos;ve had your talk with Cairo .
now you can talk to me .
Yes , of course .
I &apos;m listening .
I &apos;m still listening .
look at the time .
I must be going . no .
not till you &apos;ve told me all about it .
am I a prisoner ?
maybe the boy outside hasn &apos;t gone home yet .
do you suppose he &apos;s still there ?
likely .
you can start now .
you are the most insistent person .
and wild and unpredictable , huh ?
say , what &apos;s this bird , this Falcon that everybody &apos;s all steamed up about ?
supposing I wouldn &apos;t tell you anything about it at all ?
what would you do ?
something wild and unpredictable ?
I might .
it &apos;s a black figure , as you know , smooth and shiny , of a bird , a hawk or falcon , about that high .
here .
what makes it so important ?
I don &apos;t know .
they wouldn &apos;t tell me .
that was in Istanbul ?
Marmara .
go ahead .
but that &apos;s all .
then we found out that Joel Cairo intended to desert us , taking the Falcon with him and leaving Floyd and me nothing .
so we did exactly that to him .
then I wasn &apos;t any better off than I was before , because Floyd hadn &apos;t any intention of keeping his promise to me about sharing equally .
I &apos;d learned that by the time we got here .
what &apos;s the bird made of ?
Porcelain or black stone .
I don &apos;t know . I only saw it once for a few minutes .
Floyd showed it to me when we first got hold of it .
you are a liar .
I am .
I &apos;ve always been a liar .
don &apos;t brag about it .
was there any truth at all in that yarn ?
some .
not very much .
well , we got all night .
coffee &apos;ll be ready soon .
we &apos;ll have a cup and try again .
I &apos;m so tired .
so tired of lying and making up lies .
not knowing what is a lie and what &apos;s the truth .
I wish ...
I want to talk to Mr. Cairo , Joel Cairo .
thanks .
where is he ?
what ?
where is he ?
who ?
Cairo .
what do you think you &apos;re doing , Jack , kidding me ?
I &apos;ll tell you when I am .
new York , aren &apos;t you ?
shove off .
you &apos;re gonna have to talk to me before you &apos;re through , sonny .
some of you will , and you can tell the fat man I said so .
keep asking for it and you &apos;re gonna get it , plenty .
I told you to shove off .
shove off .
people lose teeth talking like that .
you want to hang around , you &apos;ll be polite .
Luke .
Hello , Sam .
Hello , Luke .
say , that was too bad about Miles .
Yeah . it was a tough break .
I want to show you something .
what do you let these cheap gunmen hang around the lobby for , with their heaters bulging in their clothes ?
what do you want here ?
well , if you don &apos;t want anything , beat it and don &apos;t come back .
I won &apos;t forget you guys .
what is it ?
I don &apos;t know . I just spotted him .
say , what about Miles ?
I &apos;ll see you , Luke .
603 .
good morning .
good morning .
there you are , sir . let &apos;s go someplace where we can talk .
no .
our private conversations have not been such that I &apos;m anxious to continue them .
forgive my speaking so bluntly , but it is the truth .
you mean last night ?
what else could I do ? I had to throw in with her .
I don &apos;t know where the bird is , and neither do you .
she does .
how &apos;re we gonna get it if I don &apos;t play along with her ?
you always have a very smooth explanation ready , huh ?
what do you want me to do ?
learn to stutter ? Dundy take you down to the station ?
how long did they work on you ?
till a little while ago .
what &apos;d they shake out of you ?
shake out ?
not one thing .
I adhered to the course you indicated earlier in your rooms , but I certainly wish you would have invented a more reasonable story .
I felt distinctly like an idiot repeating it .
don &apos;t worry about the story &apos;s goofiness .
a sensible one would have had us all in the cooler .
you sure you didn &apos;t tell them anything ?
I did not .
now , you &apos;ll want sleep if you &apos;ve been standing up under a police grilling all night .
see you later .
Yes , I &apos;ll have him call you the minute he comes in .
that &apos;s the third time she &apos;s called this morning .
Miss O &apos;Shaughnessy &apos;s in there .
anything else ?
the district attorney &apos;s office called .
Bryan would like to see you .
and a Mr. Gutman called .
and when I told him you weren &apos;t in , he said , &quot; Would you please tell him that
&quot; the young man gave me his message , and that I phoned and will phone again ? &quot;
Gutman , huh ?
thanks , darling .
darling . somebody &apos;s been in my apartment .
it &apos;s all upside down , every which way .
I changed as fast as I could and came right over here .
you must have let that boy follow you there .
no , angel .
I shook him off long before I ever went to your place .
it might have been Cairo .
he wasn &apos;t at the hotel last night .
he told me he &apos;d been standing up under a police grilling . I wonder .
you saw Joel this morning ?
Yeah .
why ?
because , my own true love , I &apos;ve got to keep in some sort of touch with all the loose ends of this dizzy affair if I &apos;m ever gonna make heads or tails of it .
now we &apos;ve got to find a new home for you .
I won &apos;t go back there .
I got an idea .
wait a minute .
what does your woman &apos;s intuition tell you about her ?
she &apos;s all right .
maybe it &apos;s her own fault for being in whatever the trouble is , but she &apos;s all right , if that &apos;s what you mean .
that &apos;s what I mean .
are you strong enough for her to put her up for a few days ?
you mean at home ?
Yeah .
is she in any danger , Sam ?
I think she is .
gee , that &apos;d scare Mom into a green hemorrhage .
I &apos;d have to say she &apos;s a surprise witness or something you &apos;re keeping undercover until the last minute .
you &apos;re a darling .
Brigid .
Effie here has offered to put you up for a few days .
that &apos;s very kind of you .
you &apos;d better start now .
go out the back entrance .
there &apos;s usually a cab parked there by the alleyway .
you ride partway with her over the bridge and make sure you &apos;re not followed .
you better change cabs a couple of times , just to be on the safe side .
I &apos;ll give Mom a ring .
there &apos;s time enough for that when you get back .
I &apos;ll call you later .
Hello ?
this is Samuel Spade .
say , my secretary tells me Mr. Bryan wants to see me .
Yeah .
ask him what time &apos;s most convenient for him .
Spade . s P A D E .
Hello , honey .
Yeah .
2 : 30 . all right . thanks .
Sam , forgive me . please forgive me .
I sent those policemen to your place last night .
I was mad , crazy with jealousy .
I phoned that if they went there , they &apos;d learn something about Miles &apos; murder .
what made you think of that ?
I was mad , Sam .
I wanted to hurt you .
did you tell them who you were when you phoned ?
no . Sam , dearest , I ...
where &apos;d you phone from ?
the drugstore across from your place .
you better hurry along home and think of something to tell the police .
you &apos;ll be hearing from them , and by the way , where were you the night Miles was murdered ?
home .
I was .
no .
but if that &apos;s your story , it &apos;s all right with me .
now you run along .
Hello ?
Yeah , this is Spade .
Yes , Mr. Gutman , I got it .
Yeah , I &apos;ve been waiting to hear from you .
well , now .
the sooner , the better . say , 15 minutes ?
right .
12C .
12C to your left , sir .
Mr. Spade .
how do you do , Mr. Gutman ?
you begin well , sir .
I distrust a man who says &quot; when . &quot;
he &apos;s got to be careful not to drink too much , because he &apos;s not to be trusted when he does .
well , sir , here &apos;s to plain speaking and clear understanding .
you &apos;re a close mouthed man ?
no , I like to talk .
better and better . I distrust a close mouthed man .
he generally picks the wrong time to talk and says the wrong things .
talking &apos;s something you can &apos;t do judiciously unless you keep in practice .
now , sir .
we &apos;ll talk , if you like .
I &apos;ll tell you right out .
I &apos;m a man who likes talking to a man who likes to talk .
swell .
will we talk about the black bird ?
you &apos;re a man for me , sir .
no beating about the bush .
right to the point .
let &apos;s talk about the black bird , by all means .
but first , sir , answer me a question .
are you here as Miss O &apos;Shaughnessy &apos;s representative ?
well , there &apos;s nothing certain either way .
it depends on ?
maybe it depends on Joel Cairo .
maybe .
the question is then which you represent .
it &apos;ll be one or the other .
I didn &apos;t say so .
who else is there ?
there &apos;s me .
that &apos;s wonderful , sir , wonderful .
I do like a man who tells you right out he &apos;s looking out for himself .
don &apos;t we all ?
I don &apos;t trust a man who says he &apos;s not .
now , let &apos;s talk about the black bird .
let &apos;s .
Mr. Spade , have you any conception of how much money can be got for that black bird ?
no .
well , sir , if I told you , if I told you half , you &apos;d call me a liar .
no , not even if I thought so .
but you tell me what it is , and I &apos;ll figure out the profit .
you mean , you don &apos;t know what the bird is ?
I know what it &apos;s supposed to look like , and I know the value in human life you people put on it .
she didn &apos;t tell you what it is ?
Cairo didn &apos;t , either ?
he offered me $ 10,000 for it .
$ 10,000 .
dollars , mind you , not even pounds .
do they know what that bird is , sir ?
what is your impression ?
there &apos;s not very much to go by .
Cairo didn &apos;t say he did , and he didn &apos;t say he didn &apos;t .
she said she didn &apos;t , but I took it for granted she was lying .
not an injudicious thing to do .
if they don &apos;t know , I &apos;m the only one in the whole wide sweet world who does .
swell . when you &apos;ve told me , that &apos;ll make two of us .
Mathematically correct , sir , but I don &apos;t know for certain that I &apos;m going to tell you .
don &apos;t be foolish .
you know what it is . I know where it is .
that &apos;s why I &apos;m here .
well , sir , where is it ?
you see , I must tell you what I know , but you won &apos;t tell me what you know .
it &apos;s hardly equitable , sir .
no , no .
I don &apos;t think we can do business along those lines .
well , think again , and think fast !
I told that gunsel of yours you &apos;d have to talk to me before you &apos;re through !
I &apos;m telling you now , you &apos;ll talk to me today , or you are through !
what are you wasting my time for ?
I can get along without you !
and another thing , keep that gunsel out of my way while you &apos;re making up your mind .
I &apos;ll kill him if you don &apos;t !
I &apos;ll kill him ! well , sir , I must say you have a most violent temper .
think it over .
you &apos;ve got till 5 : 00 .
then you &apos;re either in or out , for keeps !
who killed Thursby ?
I don &apos;t know .
perhaps you don &apos;t , but you could make an excellent guess .
my guess might be excellent or it might be crummy , but Mrs. Spade didn &apos;t raise any children dippy enough to make guesses in front of a district attorney , an assistant district attorney and a stenographer .
why shouldn &apos;t you , if you &apos;ve nothing to conceal ?
everybody has something to conceal .
I &apos;m a sworn officer of the law , 24 hours a day , and neither formality nor informality justifies you withholding evidence of crime from me except , of course , on constitutional grounds .
now , both you and the police have as much as accused me of being mixed up in the other night &apos;s murders .
well , I &apos;ve had trouble with both of you before , and as far as I can see , my best chance of clearing myself of the trouble you &apos;re trying to make for me is by bringing in the murderers all tied up .
and the only chance I &apos;ve got of catching them and tying them up and bringing them in is by staying as far away as possible from you and the police , because you &apos;d only gum up the works .
you getting this all right , son , or am I going too fast for you ?
no , sir . I &apos;m getting it all right .
good work .
now , if you want to go to the board and tell them I &apos;m obstructing justice and ask them to revoke my license , hop to it .
you tried it before , and it didn &apos;t get you anything but a good laugh all around .
now , look here .
and I don &apos;t want any more informal talks .
I &apos;ve nothing to say to you or the police , and I &apos;m tired of being called things by every crackpot on the city payroll .
so , if you want to see me pinch me or subpoena me or something , and I &apos;ll come down with my lawyer .
I &apos;ll see you at the inquest , maybe .
come on . he wants to see you .
I didn &apos;t expect you till 5 : 25 .
I hope I haven &apos;t kept you waiting .
keep on riding me , they &apos;re gonna be picking iron out of your liver .
the cheaper the crook , the gaudier the patter , huh ?
now , let &apos;s go .
come on .
this &apos;ll put you in solid with your boss .
come in , sir .
thank you for coming . come in .
here .
you shouldn &apos;t let him go around with these on him .
he might get himself hurt .
well , well , what &apos;s this ?
a crippled newsie took them away from him . I made him give them back .
by gad , sir , you &apos;re a chap worth knowing .
an amazing character . give me your hat .
sit down .
I owe you an apology , sir .
now , never mind that .
let &apos;s talk about the black bird .
all right , sir , let &apos;s .
let &apos;s .
this is going to be the most astounding thing you &apos;ve ever heard of , sir .
and I say this knowing that a man of your caliber and your profession must have known some astounding things in his time .
what do you know , sir , about the Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem , later known as the Knights of Rhodes and other things ?
Crusaders or something , weren &apos;t they ? very good .
sit down .
in 1539 , these crusading Knights persuaded Emperor Charles V to give them the island of Malta .
he made but one condition , that they pay him each year the tribute of a falcon in acknowledgement that Malta was still under Spain .
do you follow me ?
have you any conception of the extreme , the immeasurable wealth of the Order of that time ?
I imagine they were pretty well fixed .
&quot; pretty well &quot; is putting it mildly . they were rolling in wealth , sir .
for years they &apos;d taken from the East nobody knows what spoils of gems , precious metals , silks , ivory , sir .
we all know the holy wars to them were largely a matter of loot .
the Knights were profoundly grateful to the Emperor Charles for his generosity toward them .
they hit upon the happy thought of sending him , for his first year &apos;s tribute , not an insignificant live bird but a glorious golden falcon crusted from head to foot with the finest jewels in their coffers .
well , sir , what do you think of that ?
these are facts , historical facts , not schoolbook history , not Mr. Wells &apos; history , but history , nevertheless .
they sent this foot high jeweled bird to Charles , who was then in Spain .
they sent it in a galley commanded by a member of the Order .
it never reached Spain .
a famous admiral of buccaneers took the Knights &apos; galley and the bird .
in 1713 , it turned up in Sicily .
in 1840 , it appeared in Paris .
it had , by that time , acquired a coat of black enamel , so that it looked nothing more than a fairly interesting black statuette .
in that disguise , sir , it was , as you may say , kicked around Paris for over three score years by private owners too stupid to see what it was under the skin .
then , in 1923 , a Greek dealer named Charilaos Konstantinides found it in an obscure shop .
no thickness of enamel could conceal value from his eyes .
you begin to believe me a little ?
I haven &apos;t said I didn &apos;t .
well , sir , to hold it safe while pursuing his researches into its history ,
Charilaos re enameled the bird .
despite this precaution , however , I got wind of his find .
if I &apos;d only known a few days sooner .
I was in London when I heard .
I packed a bag , got on the boat train immediately .
on the train I opened the paper , The Times , and read that Charilaos &apos;s establishment had been burglarized and him murdered .
sure enough , on arriving there , I discovered the bird was gone .
that was 17 years ago .
well , sir , it took me 17 years to locate that bird , but I did .
I wanted it .
I &apos;m a man not easily discouraged when I want something .
I traced it to the home of a Russian general , one Kemidov , in an Istanbul suburb .
he didn &apos;t know a thing about it .
it was nothing but a black enameled figure to him , but his natural contrariness kept him from selling it to me when I made him an offer .
so I sent him some agents to get it .
well , sir , they got it and I haven &apos;t got it .
but I &apos;m going to get it .
your glass .
then the bird doesn &apos;t really belong to any of you , but to a General Kemidov ?
well , sir , you might as well say it belonged to the King of Spain .
I don &apos;t see how you can honestly grant anyone else a clear title to it except by right of possession .
and now , sir , before we start to talk prices , how soon can you or how soon are you willing to produce the Falcon ?
a couple of days .
that is satisfactory .
well , sir , here &apos;s to a fair bargain . profits large enough for both of us .
what &apos;s your idea of a fair bargain ?
I will give you $ 25,000 when you deliver the Falcon to me and another $ 25,000 later on .
or I will give you one quarter of what I realize on the Falcon .
that would amount to a vastly greater sum .
how much greater ?
who knows ?
shall we say $ 100,000 ?
would you believe me if I name a sum that seems the probable minimum ?
why not ?
what would you say to a quarter of a million ?
then you think the dingus is worth a million , huh ?
in your own words , why not ?
that &apos;s a lot of dough .
a lot of dough .
minimum , huh ?
what &apos;s the maximum ?
the maximum , I refuse to guess .
you &apos;d think me crazy .
I don &apos;t know .
there &apos;s no telling how high it could go , sir .
that is the one and only truth about it .
Wilmer !
Hello , Effie . it &apos;s me .
let me talk to Miss O &apos;Shaughnessy .
isn &apos;t there ?
what ?
she didn &apos;t show up ?
listen , you get on back to the office and wait there till I come or you hear from me .
Yeah , let &apos;s do something right for a change .
it started in the hold aft , in the rear basement .
what insurance was she carrying ?
anybody burnt ?
no . only the harbor watch was aboard !
someone I know came ...
huh ?
someone I know came aboard this afternoon , and I haven &apos;t seen her since .
I &apos;m worried . no reason to be , mister .
everybody got off all right .
I wonder if you saw her .
she &apos;s kind of small , about 5 foot ...
I couldn &apos;t tell you , mister . but if she come aboard , she got off all right .
only the harbor watch was aboard when the fire started .
now you know as much about it as I do , precious .
maybe they went down to the ship .
maybe they didn &apos;t . the part about the bird is thrilling .
or ridiculous .
you know .
Falcon .
lock that door .
is ...
is he ...
Yeah .
he couldn &apos;t have come far with those holes in him .
why couldn &apos;t he have stayed alive long enough to tell us something ?
here , here , here , none of that now .
you can &apos;t pass out on me now .
all right , Sam .
do you really think it &apos;s ...
we &apos;ve got it , angel , we &apos;ve got it !
answer the phone .
Hello .
Yes .
Oh , yes .
where ?
Yes , yes .
Hello ?
Hello !
Hello ! that was Miss O &apos;Shaughnessy .
she wants you .
she &apos;s in danger .
where is she ?
Burlingame , 26 Ancho . Sam , her voice , it was awful .
and something happened to her before she could finish .
go help her , Sam !
you &apos;ve got to go to her , don &apos;t you see ? he was helping her , and they killed him ...
you &apos;ve got to go , Sam !
all right , I &apos;ll go .
now , after I &apos;ve gone , you phone the police .
tell them how it happened , but don &apos;t drag any names in .
you don &apos;t know . I got the phone call and told you I had to go , but I didn &apos;t say where .
now forget about this thing .
tell them how it happened , but without the bundle .
now get that straight .
everything happened exactly as it did happen , but without the bundle , and I got the phone call , not you .
Yes , Sam .
shut this door and lock it behind me and don &apos;t open it till the police come .
do you know who he is ?
Yeah , it &apos;s Captain Jacoby , master of the La Paloma .
you &apos;re a good man , sister .
can I borrow your pencil ?
say , Frank ?
Hello , Mr. Spade .
you got plenty of gas ?
sure thing .
do you know where Ancho Street or Avenue is in Burlingame ?
Nope , but if she &apos;s there , we can find her .
well , 26 is the number and the sooner the better .
all right .
keep your motor running .
bum steer , Mr. Spade ?
Yeah .
let &apos;s get to a phone booth .
Hello , Mrs. Perine ?
is Effie there ?
Yes , please .
Hello , precious . what &apos;s the good news ?
no , no . it was a bum steer .
are you sure that was her voice ?
well , it was hooey .
everything go all right ?
nothing said about the bundle , huh ?
that &apos;s swell .
they take you down to the hall ?
all right , precious .
you better hit the hay and get a good night &apos;s rest .
you sound all in .
no , no .
save it till tomorrow .
I &apos;m going on home .
thanks . good night , Frank .
good night , Mr. Spade .
I &apos;ve been hiding in a doorway up the street .
I thought you &apos;d never come .
can you make it all right , or shall I carry you ?
I &apos;ll be all right as soon as I can get some place where I can lie down .
well , sir , we &apos;re all here .
now , let &apos;s come in and sit down and be comfortable and talk .
sure .
you &apos;re not gonna frisk me .
stand still . shut up .
take your paws off me , or I &apos;ll make you use that gun .
ask your boss if he wants me shot up before we talk .
never mind , Wilmer .
you certainly are a most headstrong individual .
well , let &apos;s be seated .
are you ready to make the first payment and take the Falcon off my hands ?
well , sir , as to that ...
as to that ...
$ 10,000 ?
we were talking about a lot more money than this .
Yes , sir , we were .
but this is genuine coin of the realm .
with a dollar of this , you can buy $ 10 of talk .
and there are more of us to be taken care of now .
that may be , but I &apos;ve got the Falcon .
I shouldn &apos;t think it would be necessary to remind you , Mr. Spade , that you may have the Falcon , but we certainly have you .
Yeah , I &apos;m trying not to let that worry me . we &apos;ll get back to the money later on .
there &apos;s something else to be discussed first .
we &apos;ve got to have a fall guy .
the police have got to have a victim , somebody they can pin those three murders on .
three ?
but there &apos;s only two , because Thursby certainly killed your partner .
all right .
only two then .
what difference does it make ?
the point is , we &apos;ve got to give the police ...
come , come , Mr. Spade , you can &apos;t expect us to believe at this late date that you &apos;re the least bit afraid of the police , or that you &apos;re not quite able to handle ...
I &apos;m in this up to my neck , Gutman .
I &apos;ve got to find somebody , a victim , when the time comes . if I don &apos;t , I &apos;ll be it .
let &apos;s give them the gunsel .
he actually did shoot Thursby and Jacoby , didn &apos;t he ?
anyway , he &apos;s made to order for the part . look at him .
let &apos;s give him to them .
by gad , sir , you are a character . that you are .
there &apos;s never any telling what you &apos;ll say or do next , except that it &apos;s bound to be something astonishing .
why , it &apos;s our best bet .
with him in their hands ...
but , my dear man , can &apos;t you see that if I , even for a moment , thought of doing such a thing ...
I feel towards Wilmer here just exactly as if he were my own son .
really , I do .
but if I even for a moment thought of doing what you propose , what in the world would keep Wilmer from telling the police every last detail about the Falcon and all ...
let him talk his head off .
I &apos;ll guarantee you nobody &apos;ll do anything about it .
well , what do you think of this , Wilmer ? mighty funny .
mighty funny .
how do you feel now ? any better , precious ?
much better .
but I &apos;m frightened .
well , don &apos;t be .
nothing very bad &apos;s going to happen here .
you want a drink , angel ?
be careful , Sam .
well ?
if you &apos;re really serious about this , the least we can do in common politeness is to hear you out .
now , how would you be able to fix it so that Wilmer couldn &apos;t do us any harm ?
I can show Bryan , our district attorney , that if he goes around trying to collect everybody , he &apos;s gonna have a tangled case , but if he sticks to Wilmer here , he can get a conviction standing on his head .
get up on your feet .
I &apos;ve taken all the riding from you I &apos;m gonna take .
get up and shoot it out !
young Wild West .
maybe you &apos;d better tell him that shooting me before you get your hands on the Falcon is gonna be bad for business .
now , now , Wilmer . we can &apos;t have any of that .
you shouldn &apos;t let yourself attach so much importance to these things .
then tell him to lay off me then .
now , Wilmer ...
your plan is not at all satisfactory , sir .
let &apos;s not say anything more about it . all right .
I &apos;ve got another suggestion .
it may not be as good as the first one , but it &apos;s better than nothing .
you want to hear it ? most assuredly .
give them Cairo .
well , by gad , sir ...
and suppose we give them you or Miss O &apos;Shaughnessy ? how about that ? you want the Falcon .
I &apos;ve got it .
the fall guy &apos;s part of the price I &apos;m asking .
as for Miss O &apos;Shaughnessy , if you think she can be rigged for the part , I &apos;m perfectly willing to discuss it with you .
you seem to forget that you are not in a position at all to insist upon anything . now , come , gentlemen .
let &apos;s keep our discussion on a friendly basis .
there certainly is something in what Mr. Cairo said .
if you kill me , how are you gonna get the bird ?
and if I know you can &apos;t afford to kill me , how are you going to scare me into giving it to you ?
sir , there are other means of persuasion besides killing and threatening to kill . Yes , that &apos;s ...
that &apos;s true .
but they &apos;re none of them any good unless the threat of death is behind them .
you see what I mean ?
if you start something , I &apos;ll make it a matter of your having to kill me or call it off .
that &apos;s an attitude , sir , that calls for the most delicate judgment on both sides .
because , as you know , sir , in the heat of action , men are likely to forget where their best interests lie and let their emotions carry them away .
then the trick from my angle is to make my play strong enough to tie you up , but not make you mad enough to bump me off against your better judgment .
by gad , sir , you are a character .
six two uneven .
they &apos;re selling you out , sonny .
I hope you &apos;re not letting yourself be influenced by the guns these pocket edition desperadoes are waving around .
because I &apos;ve practiced taking guns away from these boys before , so we &apos;ll have no trouble there .
Wilmer , here is ...
all right . Wilmer .
Wilmer !
Wilmer !
there &apos;s our fall guy .
either you &apos;ll say yes right now , or I &apos;ll turn the Falcon and the whole lot of you in .
don &apos;t like that , sir .
you won &apos;t like it .
you can have him .
I won &apos;t be able to get the Falcon till daylight , or maybe later .
it strikes me it &apos;d be best for all concerned if we did not get out of each other &apos;s sight until our business has been transacted .
you have the envelope ?
Miss O &apos;Shaughnessy has it . that &apos;s all right .
hang on to it .
we don &apos;t have to lose sight of each other . the dingus &apos;ll be brought to us here .
excellent , sir , excellent .
and in exchange for the $ 10,000 and Wilmer , you &apos;ll give us the Falcon and an hour or two of grace .
now , let &apos;s get the details fixed , first .
why did he shoot Thursby and why , where and how did he shoot Captain Jacoby ?
you see , I &apos;ve got to know all that happened , so I can be sure the parts that don &apos;t fit are covered up .
I shall be candid with you , sir .
Thursby was Miss O &apos;Shaughnessy &apos;s ally .
we believed that disposing of him in the manner we did would cause Miss O &apos;Shaughnessy to stop and think that , perhaps , it would be best to patch up her differences with us regarding the Falcon .
then you didn &apos;t try to make a deal with him before giving him the works ?
we did . Yes , sir . we most certainly did .
I talked to him myself that very night , but I could do nothing with him .
he was quite determinedly loyal to Miss O &apos;Shaughnessy .
so Wilmer followed him back to the hotel and did what he did .
that sounds all right .
now , Jacoby .
Captain Jacoby &apos;s death was entirely Miss O &apos;Shaughnessy &apos;s fault .
tell me what happened .
well , Cairo , as you must have surmised , got in touch with me after he left police headquarters yesterday night or morning .
he recognized the mutual advantage of pooling forces .
Mr. Cairo is a man of nice judgment .
the Paloma was his thought .
he saw the notice of its arrival in the papers and remembered he had heard in Hong Kong that Jacoby and Miss O &apos;Shaughnessy were seen together .
well , sir , he saw that notice and , putting two and two together , guessed the truth .
she had given the bird to Jacoby to bring here for her .
and at that juncture , you decided to slip me a Mickey , huh ?
there was no place for you in our plan , sir .
so we decided to spare ourselves any possible embarrassment .
Mr. Cairo and Wilmer and I went to call on Captain Jacoby .
we were lucky enough to arrive while Miss O &apos;Shaughnessy was there .
in many ways , the conference was difficult , but we finally persuaded
Miss O &apos;Shaughnessy to come to terms , or so we thought .
we then left the boat and set out for my hotel , where I was to pay Miss O &apos;Shaughnessy and receive the bird .
well , sir , we mere men should have known better .
En route , she , Captain Jacoby and the Falcon slipped completely through our fingers .
it was neatly done , sir .
indeed , it was .
you touched off the boat before you left ?
no , not intentionally .
though , I daresay , we , or Wilmer at least , were responsible for the fire .
while the rest of us were talking in the cabin , Wilmer went about the boat , trying to find the Falcon .
no doubt , he was careless with matches .
how about the shooting ?
we caught up with Miss O &apos;Shaughnessy and Jacoby at her apartment .
I sent Wilmer downstairs to cover the fire escape before ringing the bell .
and , sure enough , while she was asking us who we were through the door , and we were telling her , we heard a window go up .
Wilmer shot Jacoby as he was coming down the fire escape , shot him more than once , but Jacoby was too tough to fall or drop the Falcon .
he climbed down the rest of the way , knocked Wilmer over and ran off .
we persuaded , that is the word , sir , we persuaded Miss O &apos;Shaughnessy to tell us where she had told Captain Jacoby to take the Falcon .
and we further persuaded her to phone your office in an attempt to draw you away before Jacoby got there , but , unfortunately for us , it had taken us too long to persuade Miss O &apos;Shaughnessy .
and you had the Falcon before we could reach you .
well , Wilmer , I &apos;m sorry indeed to lose you , but I want you to know
I couldn &apos;t be fonder of you if you were my own son .
but , well , if you lose a son , it &apos;s possible to get another .
there &apos;s only one Maltese Falcon .
when you &apos;re young , you simply don &apos;t understand these things .
how about some coffee ?
put the pot on , will you , angel ?
I don &apos;t like to leave our guests .
surely .
just a moment , my dear .
hadn &apos;t you better leave the envelope in here ?
sit on it , if you &apos;re afraid of losing it .
you misunderstand me .
it &apos;s not that at all .
but business should be transacted in a businesslike manner .
for instance , there are only nine bills here now .
there were 10 when I handed them to you , as you very well know .
well ?
I want to know about this .
you palmed it .
I palmed it ?
Yes .
do you want to say so , or do you want to stand for a frisk ?
you &apos;re going to admit it , or I &apos;m gonna search you . there &apos;s no third way .
by gad , I believe you would .
I really do .
you are a character , if you don &apos;t mind my saying so .
you palmed it .
Yes , sir , that I did .
I must have my little joke now and then .
and I was curious to know what you would do in a situation of this sort .
I must say you passed the test with flying colors .
it &apos;s the sort of a thing I &apos;d expect from somebody Wilmer &apos;s age .
this will soon be yours . you might as well take it .
I ought to have more than $ 10,000 .
of course , sir . you understand this is the first payment .
later .
Oh , yes . later you &apos;ll give me millions , but how &apos;s about $ 15,000 now ?
frankly and candidly , upon my word of honor as a gentleman ,
$ 10,000 is all the money I can raise .
but you didn &apos;t say positively .
positively .
I &apos;d like to give you a word of advice .
go ahead .
I daresay you &apos;re going to give her some money , but if you don &apos;t give her as much as she thinks she ought to have , my word of advice is be careful .
dangerous ?
very .
how &apos;s the coffee coming , angel ?
in a few minutes .
it &apos;s almost daylight , Mr. Spade .
can you start getting it now ?
I guess so .
Hello ?
Hello , precious .
I &apos;m sorry to get you up so early .
now , listen carefully .
here &apos;s the plot .
in the holland box at the post office there &apos;s an envelope with my scrawl .
in that envelope , there &apos;s a parcel room check for the bundle we got yesterday .
now , get that bundle and bring it here , PDQ .
that &apos;s a good girl . now hustle . Goodbye .
thanks , lady .
sorry to spoil your day of rest .
not the first one you &apos;ve spoiled . anything else ?
no . no , thanks .
Bye bye , then .
there you are .
now , after 17 years ...
it is it .
but we &apos;ll make sure .
fake .
it &apos;s a phony !
it &apos;s lead !
it &apos;s lead !
it &apos;s a fake !
all right , you &apos;ve had your little joke .
now , tell us about it .
no , Sam ! no !
that &apos;s the one I got from Kemidov . I swear it !
you .
it &apos;s you who bungled it .
you and your stupid attempt to buy it !
Kemidov found out how valuable it was !
no wonder we had such an easy time stealing it !
you imbecile !
you bloated idiot !
you stupid fathead , you !
Yes , it &apos;s the Russian &apos;s hand . there &apos;s no doubt about it .
well , sir , what do you suggest ?
we stand here and shed tears and call each other names , or shall we go to Istanbul ?
are you going ?
seventeen years I &apos;ve wanted that little item and have been trying to get it .
if we must spend another year on the quest , well , sir , it will be an additional expenditure in time of only five and fifteen seventeenths percent .
I &apos;m going with you .
Wilmer .
a swell lot of thieves .
we &apos;ve little enough to boast about , sir , but the world hasn &apos;t come to an end just because we &apos;ve run into a little setback .
I must ask you for that envelope .
I held up my end .
you got your dingus .
it &apos;s your hard luck , not mine , it wasn &apos;t what you wanted .
now , come , sir , we &apos;ve all failed , and there &apos;s no reason for expecting any of us to bear the whole brunt .
in short , sir , I must ask you for my $ 10,000 .
this &apos;ll take care of my time and expenses .
now , sir , we &apos;ll say goodbye to you , unless you care to undertake the Istanbul expedition with us .
you don &apos;t ?
well , frankly , sir , I &apos;d like to have you along .
you &apos;re a man of nice judgment and many resources .
now that there &apos;s no alternative ,
I daresay you &apos;ll manage the police without a fall guy .
I &apos;ll make out all right .
well , sir , the shortest farewells are best .
adieu .
and to you , Miss O &apos;Shaughnessy , I leave the rara avis on the table there as a little memento .
Hello . is Sergeant Polhaus there ?
Yeah . put him on . this is Sam Spade .
Hello . Tom ? now , listen .
here it is . Jacoby and Thursby were killed by a kid named Wilmer Cook .
Yeah . he &apos;s about 20 years old , 5 &apos; 6 &quot; , wearing a gray overcoat .
he &apos;s working for a man named Kasper Gutman .
now , you can &apos;t miss Gutman . he must weigh 300 pounds .
that fellow Cairo &apos;s in with him , too .
they just left here for the Alexandria Hotel .
but you &apos;ll have to move fast .
they &apos;re blowing town .
now , watch yourself when you go up against the kid .
Yes , that &apos;s right .
very . now , good luck , Tom .
they &apos;ll talk , when they &apos;re nailed , about us . we &apos;re sitting on dynamite .
we &apos;ve only got minutes to get set for the police . now , give me all of it , fast .
when you first came to my office , why did you want Thursby shadowed ?
I told you , Sam .
I thought he was betraying me , and I wanted to find out .
that &apos;s a lie !
you had Thursby hooked , and you knew it , and you wanted to get rid of him before Jacoby came with the loot , so you wouldn &apos;t have to split it with him .
what was your scheme ?
I thought if he knew someone was following him , he &apos;d be frightened into going away .
miles wasn &apos;t clumsy enough to be spotted the first night .
you told Thursby he was being followed .
I told him .
I told him .
Yes , but please believe me , Sam .
I wouldn &apos;t have told him if I thought Floyd would kill him .
if you thought he wouldn &apos;t kill Miles , you were right , angel .
miles hadn &apos;t many brains , but he &apos;d had too many years experience as a detective to be caught like that by a man he was shadowing up a blind alley with his gun on his hip and his overcoat buttoned .
but he &apos;d have gone up there with you , angel .
he was just dumb enough for that .
he &apos;d have looked you up and down , and licked his lips and gone , grinning from ear to ear .
and you could have stood as close to him as you liked in the dark and put a hole through him with a gun you got from Thursby that evening .
don &apos;t , Sam .
don &apos;t say that !
stop it !
the police &apos;ll be here any minute !
now talk !
why do you accuse me ...
this isn &apos;t the time for that schoolgirl act !
we &apos;re both of us sitting under the gallows !
now , why did you shoot Miles ?
I didn &apos;t mean to at first , really , I didn &apos;t .
but when I found out that Floyd couldn &apos;t be frightened ...
I can &apos;t look at you and tell you this , Sam !
you thought Thursby would tackle Miles and one or the other would go down .
if Thursby was killed , you were rid of him .
if it was Miles , you &apos;d see that Thursby was caught and set up for it .
isn &apos;t that right ?
something like that .
when you found that Thursby wasn &apos;t going to tackle him , you borrowed his gun and did it yourself , right ?
and when you heard Thursby was shot , you knew Gutman was in town .
and you knew you needed another protector , somebody to fill Thursby &apos;s boots , so you came back to me .
Yes !
sweetheart , it wasn &apos;t only that .
I &apos;d have come back to you , sooner or later .
from the very first instant I saw you , I knew .
well , if you get a good break , you &apos;ll be out of Tehachapi in 20 years , and you can come back to me then .
I hope they don &apos;t hang you , precious , by that sweet neck .
you &apos;re not ...
Yes , angel , I &apos;m gonna send you over .
the chances are you &apos;ll get off with life .
that means , if you &apos;re a good girl , you &apos;ll be out in 20 years .
I &apos;ll be waiting for you .
if they hang you , I &apos;ll always remember you .
don &apos;t , Sam .
don &apos;t say that , even in fun .
I was frightened for a minute .
I really thought ...
you do such wild and unpredictable things .
now , don &apos;t be silly .
you &apos;re taking the fall .
you &apos;ve been playing with me , just pretending you cared to trap me like this .
you didn &apos;t care at all !
you don &apos;t love me !
I won &apos;t play the sap for you .
you know it &apos;s not like that .
you can &apos;t say that .
you never played square with me for half an hour at a stretch since I &apos;ve known you .
you know down deep in your heart that in spite of anything I &apos;ve done , I love you .
I don &apos;t care who loves who !
I won &apos;t play the sap for you !
I won &apos;t walk in Thursby &apos;s and I don &apos;t know how many others &apos; footsteps !
you killed Miles , and you &apos;re going over for it .
how can you do this to me , Sam ?
surely Mr. Archer wasn &apos;t as much to you as ...
listen .
this won &apos;t do any good .
you &apos;ll never understand me , but I &apos;ll try once and then give it up .
when a man &apos;s partner is killed , he &apos;s supposed to do something about it .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference what you thought of him .
he was your partner , and you &apos;re supposed to do something about it , and it happens we &apos;re in the detective business .
well , when one of your organization gets killed , it &apos;s ...
it &apos;s bad business to let the killer get away with it , bad all around , bad for every detective everywhere .
you don &apos;t expect me to think that these things you &apos;re saying are sufficient reason for sending me ...
wait till I &apos;m through .
then you can talk .
I &apos;ve no earthly reason to think I can trust you , and if I do this and get away with it , you &apos;ll have something on me that you can use whenever you want to .
since I &apos;ve got something on you ,
I couldn &apos;t be sure that you wouldn &apos;t put a hole in me someday .
all those are on one side .
maybe some of them are unimportant .
I won &apos;t argue about that .
but look at the number of them .
and what have we got on the other side ?
all we &apos;ve got is that maybe you love me and maybe I love you .
you know whether you love me or not .
maybe I do .
I &apos;ll have some rotten nights after I &apos;ve sent you over , but that &apos;ll pass .
and if all I &apos;ve said doesn &apos;t mean anything to you , then forget it and we &apos;ll make it just this ,
I won &apos;t because all of me wants to regardless of consequences , and because you &apos;ve counted on that with me the same as you counted on that with all the others .
would you &apos;ve done this to me if the Falcon had been real and you &apos;d got your money ?
don &apos;t be too sure I &apos;m as crooked as I &apos;m supposed to be .
that sort of reputation might be good business , bringing high priced jobs and making it easier to deal with the enemy , but a lot more money would have been one more item on your side of the scales .
if you &apos;d loved me , you wouldn &apos;t have needed any more on that side .
come in .
Hello , Tom . got them ?
got them .
swell . here &apos;s another one for you .
she killed Miles .
and I &apos;ve got some exhibits , the boys &apos; guns , one of Cairo &apos;s , and a $ 1,000 bill I was supposed to be bribed with , and this black statuette here that all the fuss was about .
what &apos;s the matter with your little playmate ?
he looks brokenhearted .
and I bet when he heard Gutman &apos;s story , he thought he had me .
cut it out , Sam .
well , shall we be getting down to the hall ?
it &apos;s heavy .
what is it ?
the stuff that dreams are made of .

I didn &apos;t expect too .

I regret now .
sorry .
among these things , the firm Dad had been close to went banrupt .
he &apos;d drawn notes for huge sums for it .
we were surprised .
he didn &apos;t draw them recently .
he had been postponing their due date .
we are morally responsible for their payment .
we can &apos;t pay the entire amount .
but we must pay at least half .
he was very powerful in the economic world .
but his fame caused this disaster .
Dad was a man with a pure heart and clean hands .
he always was .
now , we must be satisfied .
I spoe to Suzui too .
we will sell everything , this house , land ...
to pay his note .

Massage for you ?

I don &apos;t have any too .
what a pity .
I spent the money eating with Toio .
you are nice .

shall I tell Kazuo to stop ?
never mind .
but you are tired .
the maids must get up early .
what will you do ?
I will as her to stop .
don &apos;t bother !
no problem .
do as you lie , but tell her politely .
can you stop playing the piano ?
why , noisy ?
mother can &apos;t sleep .
thans .
I don &apos;t mind .
good night .
Setsuo !
we must be more considerate of each other .
this time I might have been wrong .
sometimes I have to swallow my complaints because ... we live in the same house .
when the guest came this morning , you should have greeted them .
we thought it would disturb them .
why ?
didn &apos;t you tell us to stay out ?
Yes , I did .
then ...
if you had stayed out , it &apos;s all right .
but when you came bac you should have greeted them .
and Tanimoto was one of the guests
mother nows her , doesn &apos;t she ?
no one lies to admit she is wrong .
they soon learn what is wrong with other people .
but they must bear it for each other &apos;s sae .
right ?
do you understand ?
understand ?
good night .
they have trouble ?
neither of them is wrong .
it happens because they must live together in that house .
maybe .
they are in a bad mood sometimes .
moving may be good diversion for mother .
fine , I will let them stay here .
really ?
than you .
I hope Ryoichi studies hard ... even with his Grandmother here , but with her around he might not obey me .
I will warn them about it .
all right .
after staying here , they might move to Ayao &apos;s .
will the maid come , too ?
Yes , they will bring lots of things .
and the bird , too .
want to wor ?
what about a cler ?
what ind of job do you want ?
don &apos;t , your friend may be woring .
but you are different .
don &apos;t thin so casually .
it is not only your concern .
please consider us !
your father would be disgraced .
what will the others thin if you go out to wor ?
Dad died , we may not be well off .
but you have no need to wor .
our situation is not that worse .
don &apos;t thin too much .
your wedding is coming .
give up this stupid idea .
understand ?
don &apos;t thin about it again !
suppose I went shopping and found you as the cler .
I will be ashamed .
are you sure ?
anyone around ?
go clean upstairs . Hey ! where are my clothes ?
please prepare for me .
and a coat .
going out ?
did my son go to school yesterday ?
every day ?
of course .
but his teacher wants to meet me .
he hasn &apos;t been to school .
the teacher said he is often absent .
I wonder what happened .
any ideas ?
come to thin of it .
one day , you were out and he was home .
I ased him why he wasn &apos;t at school .
he said he had fought with a friend of his .
when was it ?
when I was still living with Soichiro .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
I should have . I &apos;m sorry .
this might not have happened .
I suppose so . I should &apos;ve told you .
it &apos;s too late for that .
I am sorry
it &apos;s no use apologizing .
but I made a promise with him then .
promise for what ?
not to tell anybody if he behaves himself .
it is unreasonable .
you ept this secret from me ?
you should tell me everything .
you didn &apos;t scold him ?
Yes , I did .
it didn &apos;t wor . he did it again .
a promise with a little child ?
were you serious ?
you should now about children .
you raised many on your own .
I was thoughtless .
be more careful !
tell me everything about him .
I want to raise him my way .
but you are only spoiling him .
you are right .
I was wrong , I am sorry and I will be careful .
just stay away from my son .
Mrs Toda and Miss Setsuo have arrived .

she has grown into such a lovely girl .
Yes .
she is really nice .
when she was born , I told Mr Toda .
it &apos;s a girl .
and he said , a girl again ?
girl is worthless .
so I said , &quot; Babies can &apos;t be born without women &quot; .
he said that he new and laughed .
did that happen ?
such a long time ago .
time flies , doesn &apos;t it ?
it &apos;s already been a year since Mr Toda passed away .
Yes .
I feel lie many years have passed .
a lot of things has happened , I feel tired .
things change so wuicly , don &apos;t they ?
may be .

they stayed at my house .
and ?
they decided to move out .
I don &apos;t believe it .
I decided to move .
please eep out of this , Mother .
why do you let them live in such place ?
when we wanted to sell it you said that it was worthless .
it is too old to live .
I was surprised Mother and Setsuo moved there .
I thought they were happy to live with you .
we had our reason .
what is it ?
you were not here .
that &apos;s not the reason .
it is the wuestion of your sincerity .
don &apos;t tell me you thin Mother &apos;s only in the way .
don &apos;t ever thin I now nothing .
may be I have trusted you too much .
I should have looed after her myself .
I should have decided it earlier .
children should be ind and warm to their mother .
but you haven &apos;t .
even for just a year .
even when we are together today .
father would not be happy .
why didn &apos;t you as them to move in ?
mother has decided it .

why ?
I &apos;ve thought about it .
then why didn &apos;t you as her ?

what &apos;s this ?
something to go with Sae .
so nice , he will lie it .
I &apos;ll tae it to him .
where is he ?
he went out just now .
with the coming of the Second World War many eyes in imprisoned Europe turned hopefully , or desperately toward the freedom of the Americas .
Lisbon became the great embarkation point .
but not everybody could get to Lisbon directly .
and so a torturous , roundabout refugee trail sprang up .
Paris to Marseilles across the Mediterranean to Oran .
then , by train or auto or foot , across the rim of Africa to Casablanca in French Morocco .
here , the fortunate ones , through money or influence or luck might obtain exit visas and scurry to Lisbon .
and from Lisbon to the New World .
but the others wait in Casablanca .
and wait and wait and wait .
to all officers :
two German couriers carrying official documents murdered on train from Oran .
murderer and possible accomplices headed for Casablanca .
round up all suspicious characters and search them for stolen document .
important .
may we see your papers ?
I don &apos;t think I have them on me .
- In that case , you &apos;ll have to come along .
- Wait . it &apos;s possible that I ... Yes .
these papers expired three weeks ago .
you &apos;ll have to come along . Halt !
Halt !
- What on earth is going on there ?
- I don &apos;t know , my dear . pardon , monsieur .
pardon , madame . have you not heard ?
we hear very little , and we understand even less .
two German couriers were found murdered in the desert .
the unoccupied desert .
this is the customary roundup of refugees , liberals and , of course , a beautiful young girl for Renault , the prefect of police .
along with these unhappy refugees , the scum of Europe has gravitated to Casablanca .
some of them have been waiting years for a visa .
I beg of you , monsieur , watch yourself .
be on guard .
this place is full of vultures .
vultures everywhere . everywhere !
- Thank you .
thank you very much . - Not at all .
what an amusing little fellow .
waiter .
- Oh , how silly of me .
- What , dear ?
I &apos;ve left my wallet in the hotel .
perhaps tomorrow we &apos;ll be on the plane .
it is good to see you again , Major Strasser .
thank you , thank you .
may I present Captain Renault , police prefect of Casablanca .
Major Strasser .
unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca .
thank you , captain .
it &apos;s good to be here .
Major Strasser , my aide , Lieutenant Casselle . Captain Tonnelli .
the Italian service at your command .
that is kind of you .
you may find the climate of Casablanca a trifle warm .
we Germans must get used to all climates , from Russia to the Sahara .
- Perhaps you weren &apos;t referring to weather .
- What else ?
the murder of the couriers .
what has been done ?
my men are rounding up twice the usual number of suspects .
- But we know already who the murderer is . - Good .
is he in custody ? no hurry .
tonight he &apos;ll be at Rick &apos;s . everybody comes to Rick &apos;s .
I &apos;ve already heard about this café .
and also about Mr. Rick himself .
waiting , waiting , waiting .
I &apos;ll never get out of here .
I &apos;ll die in Casablanca .
but can &apos;t you make it just a little more ?
please ?
sorry , but diamonds are a drug on the market .
everybody sells diamonds .
there are diamonds everywhere . 2400 .
all right .
the trucks are waiting . the men are waiting . Everything--
it &apos;s the fishing smack Santiago .
it leaves at 1 tomorrow night , here from the end of La Medina .
third boat . - Thank you .
thank you . - And bring 15,000 francs in cash .
remember , in cash .
- Open up , Abdul . - Yes , professor .
- Waiter ? - Yes , madame ?
will you ask Rick if he &apos;ll have a drink with us ?
Madame , he never drinks with customers .
never . I have never seen it .
what makes saloonkeepers so snobbish ?
perhaps if you told him I ran the second-largest banking house in Amsterdam .
second largest ? that wouldn &apos;t impress Rick .
the leading banker in Amsterdam is now the pastry chef in our kitchen .
we have something to look forward to .
and his father is the bellboy .
excuse me .
I &apos;m sorry , sir . this is a private room .
of all the nerve . who do you think-- ?
I know there is gambling in there . - You dare not keep me out .
- Yes ? what &apos;s the trouble ?
I have been in every gambling room between Honolulu and Berlin .
and if you think I &apos;m going to be kept out of a saloon like this , you &apos;re much mistaken .
excuse me , please . Hello , Rick .
your cash is good at the bar .
what ?
do you know who I am ? I do .
you &apos;re lucky the bar is open to you .
this is outrageous ! I shall report it to The Angriff .
you know , watching you just now , one would think you &apos;ve been doing this all your life .
- What makes you think I haven &apos;t ?
- Nothing . - But when you first came , I thought--
- You thought what ?
what right do I have to think ?
may I ?
too bad about those two German couriers , wasn &apos;t it ?
they got a lucky break .
yesterday they were just clerks today they are the honored dead .
you are a very cynical person , Rick , if you &apos;ll forgive me for saying so .
I forgive you . - Will you have a drink with me ?
- No .
I forgot , you never drink with-- I &apos;ll have another , please .
you despise me , don &apos;t you ?
if I gave you any thought , I probably would .
but why ?
do you object to the kind of business I do ?
but think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didn &apos;t help them .
that &apos;s not so bad .
through ways of my own , I provide them with exit visas .
for a price , Ugarte . for a price .
but think of all the poor devils who can &apos;t meet Renault &apos;s price .
I get it for them for half .
is that so parasitic ?
I don &apos;t mind a parasite . I object to a cut-rate one .
well , after tonight I will be through with the whole business .
and I &apos;m leaving , finally , this Casablanca .
who did you bribe for your visa ?
Renault or yourself ? myself . I found myself much more reasonable .
look , Rick .
know what this is ?
something that even you have never seen .
letters of transit signed by General de Gaulle .
cannot be rescinded . not even questioned .
one moment .
tonight I &apos;ll be selling those for more money than I ever dreamed of .
and then , addio , Casablanca .
I have many a friend in Casablanca , but somehow , just because you despise me you are the only one I trust .
will you keep these for me , please ?
- For how long ? - Perhaps an hour .
perhaps a little longer . - I don &apos;t want them here overnight .
- Don &apos;t be afraid of that . please keep them for me .
thank you . I knew I could trust you .
waiter . I &apos;ll be expecting some people .
if anybody asks for me , I &apos;ll be right here .
Rick I hope you &apos;re more impressed with me now .
if you &apos;ll forgive me , I &apos;ll share my good luck with your roulette wheel .
just a moment .
I heard a rumor those two German couriers were carrying letters of transit .
I &apos;ve heard that rumor too .
poor devils . you &apos;re right , Ugarte .
I am a little more impressed with you .
- Hello , Rick . - Hello , Ferrari .
how &apos;s business at the Blue Parrot ?
- Fine , but I &apos;d like to buy your café .
- It &apos;s not for sale . - You haven &apos;t heard my offer .
- It &apos;s not for sale at any price .
- What do you want for Sam ?
- I don &apos;t buy or sell human beings .
too bad . that &apos;s Casablanca &apos;s leading commodity .
in refugees alone we could make a fortune , if you &apos;d work with me in the black market .
suppose you run your business and let me run mine .
suppose we ask Sam .
maybe he &apos;d like to make a change .
suppose we do .
when will you realize that in this world today isolationism is no longer a practical policy ?
Sam , Ferrari wants you to work for him at the Blue Parrot .
Oh , I like it fine here . - He &apos;ll double what I pay you .
- I ain &apos;t got time to spend what I make here .
sorry .
the boss &apos;s private stock ...
- ... because , Yvonne , I love you .
- Oh , shut up . all right , all right .
for you , I shut up , because , Yvonne , I love you .
some Germans gave this check . is it all right ?
where were you last night ?
that &apos;s so long ago , I don &apos;t remember .
- Will I see you tonight ? - I never make plans that far ahead .
give me another .
- Sascha , she &apos;s had enough .
- Don &apos;t listen to him .
fill it up . Yvonne , I love you , but he pays me .
- Rick , I &apos;m tired of having you--
- Sascha , call a cab . - We &apos;re gonna get your coat .
- Take your hands off me . you &apos;re going home . you &apos;ve had a little too much to drink .
Hey , taxi .
who do you think you are , pushing me around ?
I was a fool to fall for a man like you .
go with her , Sascha .
be sure she gets home .
and come right back . Yes , boss .
- Hello , Rick .
- Hello , Louis . how extravagant you are , throwing away women .
someday they may be scarce .
I think now I shall pay a call on Yvonne .
maybe get her on the rebound .
when it comes to women , you &apos;re a true democrat .
if he gets a word in , it &apos;ll be a major Italian victory .
the plane to Lisbon .
you would like to be on it ?
why ? what &apos;s in Lisbon ?
the clipper to America .
I &apos;ve often speculated on why you don &apos;t return to America .
did you abscond with the church funds ?
did you run off with a senator &apos;s wife ?
I like to think you killed a man .
it &apos;s the romantic in me . it &apos;s a combination of all three .
and what in heaven &apos;s name brought you to Casablanca ?
my health . I came to Casablanca for the waters .
the waters ?
what waters ? we &apos;re in the desert .
I was misinformed .
excuse me , Monsieur Rick .
a gentleman inside has won 20,000 francs and the cashier would like some money .
I &apos;ll get it from the safe .
I &apos;m so upset , Rick .
you know I-- Forget it , Emil .
mistakes like that happen all the time .
I &apos;m awfully sorry .
Rick , there will be some excitement here tonight .
an arrest in your café .
- Again ?
- This is no ordinary arrest .
a murderer , no less .
if you &apos;re thinking of warning him , don &apos;t put yourself out .
he cannot escape . - I stick my neck out for nobody .
- A wise foreign policy .
could have made the arrest earlier , at the Blue Parrot .
out of my regard for you , we &apos;re staging it here .
it will amuse your customers .
our entertainment &apos;s enough .
we &apos;re to have an important guest here tonight .
Major Strasser of the Third Reich , no less .
we want him to be here when we make the arrest .
a demonstration of the efficiency of my administration .
I see . and what &apos;s Strasser doing here ?
he certainly didn &apos;t come here to witness a demonstration of your efficiency .
- Perhaps not . - Here . - It shall not happen again .
- That &apos;s all right .
Louis , you got something on your mind .
why don &apos;t you spill it . how observant you are .
as a matter of fact , I wanted to give you a word of advice .
Yeah ? - Have a brandy ? - Thank you .
there are many exit visas sold in this café , but we know that you &apos;ve never sold one .
that is the reason we permit you to remain open .
I thought it was because I let you win at roulette .
that is another reason .
there is a man arrived in Casablanca on his way to America .
he will offer a fortune to anyone who &apos;ll furnish an exit visa .
- What &apos;s his name ?
- Victor Laszlo .
Victor Laszlo ? Rick , that is the first time I &apos;ve seen you so impressed .
he &apos;s succeeded in impressing half the world .
it &apos;s my duty to see that he doesn &apos;t impress the other half .
Laszlo must never reach America . he stays in Casablanca .
it &apos;ll be interesting to see how he manages .
- Manages what ?
- His escape .
- But I just told you--
- Stop it . he escaped from a concentration camp .
the Nazis have chased him all over Europe .
this is the end of the chase .
Twenty thousand francs says it isn &apos;t .
is that a serious offer ?
I just paid out 20 , and I &apos;d like to get it back .
make it 10 . I &apos;m only a poor corrupt official .
- Okay .
- Done . no matter how clever he is , he still needs an exit visa .
or I should say two .
- Why two ? - He is traveling with a lady .
- He &apos;ll take one .
- I think not . I &apos;ve seen the lady .
and if he did not leave her in Marseilles or Oran he certainly won &apos;t leave her in Casablanca .
maybe he &apos;s not quite as romantic as you are .
it doesn &apos;t matter . there is no exit visa for him .
what ever gave you the impression that I might help Laszlo escape ?
because , my dear Ricky , I suspect that under that cynical shell you are at heart a sentimentalist .
laugh if you will , but I happen to be familiar with your record .
let me point out just two items :
in 1935 , you ran guns to Ethiopia .
in 1936 , you fought in Spain on the Loyalist side .
and got well paid for it on both occasions .
the winning side would have paid you much better .
maybe . it seems you &apos;re determined to keep Laszlo here .
I have my orders .
I see .
Gestapo spank . my dear Ricky , you overestimate the influence of the Gestapo .
I don &apos;t interfere with them , and they don &apos;t interfere with me .
in Casablanca , I am master of my fate .
- I am--
- Major Strasser is here , sir .
- You were saying ? - Excuse me .
Carl , see that Major Strasser gets a good table , close to the ladies .
I have already given him the best , knowing he is German and would take it anyway .
take him quietly .
two guards at every door .
- Everything is ready , sir . - Go ahead .
- Good evening , gentlemen . - Good evening , captain .
- Won &apos;t you join us ?
- Thank you .
- It &apos;s a pleasure to have you here , major .
- Champagne and a tin of caviar .
may I recommend Veuve Clicquot &apos; 26 , a good French wine .
very well , sir .
- A very interesting club .
- Especially so tonight , major .
in a few minutes you &apos;ll see the arrest of the man who murdered your couriers .
I expected no less , captain .
monsieur Ugarte .
- Will you please come with us ?
- Certainly .
may I first please cash my chips ?
very lucky , huh ?
two thousand , please .
Rick ! Rick , help me !
- Don &apos;t be a fool .
you can &apos;t get away .
- But , Rick , hide me . do something !
excellent , captain .
when they come for me , I hope you &apos;ll be more of a help .
I stick my neck out for nobody .
I &apos;m sorry there was a disturbance , folks , but it &apos;s all over now .
just sit down and have a good time .
enjoy yourselves . all right , Sam .
Rick , this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich .
- How do you do , Mr. Rick ?
- How do you do ? you already know Herr Heinze of the Third Reich .
please join us , Mr. Rick .
we are very honored tonight .
Major Strasser is one of the reasons the Third Reich enjoys the reputation it has .
you repeat Third Reich as though you expected there to be others .
well , personally , major , I will take what comes .
do you mind if I ask you a few questions ?
- Unofficially , of course .
- Make it official if you like . - What is your nationality ?
- I &apos;m a drunkard .
and that makes Rick a citizen of the world .
I was born in New York City , if that &apos;ll help you any .
I understand you came here from Paris at the time of the occupation .
there seems to be no secret about that .
are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris ?
it &apos;s not particularly my beloved Paris .
can you imagine us in London ?
when you get there , ask me .
Diplomatist .
how about New York ?
well , there are sections of New York , major , that I wouldn &apos;t advise you to try to invade .
- Who do you think will win the war ?
- I haven &apos;t the slightest idea . Rick is completely neutral about everything .
and that takes in the field of women too .
you were not always so carefully neutral .
we have a complete dossier on you .
&quot; Richard Blaine , American . age : 37 .
cannot return to his country . &quot;
the reason is a little vague .
we also know what you did in Paris . and also we know why you left Paris .
don &apos;t worry , we &apos;re not going to broadcast it .
are my eyes really brown ?
you will forgive my curiosity , Mr. Blaine .
the point is an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us .
my interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one .
in this case you have no sympathy for the fox ?
not particularly .
I understand the point of view of the hound too .
Laszlo published the foulest lies in the Prague newspapers until the day we marched in .
and even after that , he continued to print scandal sheets in his cellar .
of course , one must admit he has great courage .
I admit he &apos;s clever .
three times he slipped through our fingers .
in Paris he continued his activities .
we intend not to let it happen again .
excuse me , gentlemen .
your business is politics , mine is running a saloon .
good evening , Mr. Blaine .
you see , major ?
you have nothing to worry about Rick .
perhaps .
- I reserved a table .
Victor Laszlo .
- Yes , Monsieur Laszlo . right this way .
two Cointreaux , please .
I saw no one of Ugarte &apos;s description .
Victor , I feel somehow we shouldn &apos;t stay here .
if we would walk out so soon it would only call attention to us .
perhaps Ugarte is in some other part of the café .
excuse me , but you look like a couple who are on their way to America .
you &apos;ll find a market there for this ring .
I &apos;m forced to sell it at a great sacrifice .
- Thank you , but I hardly think ... - Perhaps for the lady . the ring is quite unique .
- Yes , I &apos;m very interested .
what is your name ?
Berger , Norwegian . at your service , sir .
I &apos;ll meet you in a few minutes at the bar .
we don &apos;t want the ring , but thanks for showing it to us .
- Such a bargain .
but that is your decision ? - I &apos;m sorry , it is . - Monsieur Laszlo , is it not ?
- Yes ? I am Captain Renault , prefect of police .
Yes , what is it you want ?
merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay .
it isn &apos;t often we have so distinguished a visitor .
thank you .
I hope you &apos;ll forgive me , captain .
the present French administration hasn &apos;t always been so cordial .
may I present Miss Ilsa Lund .
I was told you were the most beautiful woman ever to visit Casablanca .
that was a gross understatement .
you &apos;re very kind .
- Won &apos;t you join us ? - If you will permit me .
Oh , no , Emile , please .
a bottle of your best champagne .
and put it on my bill .
it &apos;s a game we play .
they put it on the bill , I tear up the bill . it is very convenient .
Captain , the boy who &apos;s playing the piano ...
somewhere I &apos;ve seen him .
- Sam ?
- Yes . he came from Paris with Rick .
Rick ? who is he ?
- Mademoiselle , you are in Rick &apos;s .
Rick is ... - Is what ?
mademoiselle , he &apos;s the kind of man that , well , if I were a woman and I were not around , I should be in love with Rick .
but what a fool I am talking to a beautiful woman about another man .
excuse me . Major .
mademoiselle Lund and Monsieur Laszlo , may I present Major Strasser .
how do you do ?
this is a pleasure I have looked forward to .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;ll excuse me if I &apos;m not gracious .
you see , Major Strasser , I am a Czechoslovakian .
you were a Czechoslovakian . now you are a subject of the German Reich .
I have never accepted that privilege .
and I &apos;m now on French soil .
I should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on French soil .
this is hardly the time or place .
then we shall state another time and place .
tomorrow at 10 in the prefect &apos;s office .
with mademoiselle .
Captain , I am under your authority .
is it your order that we come to your office ?
let us say it is my request .
that is a much more pleasant word .
very well .
a very clever tactical retreat , major .
- This time they really mean to stop me .
- Victor , I &apos;m afraid for you .
we &apos;ve been in difficult places before , haven &apos;t we ?
I must find out what Berger knows .
- Be careful . - I will . don &apos;t worry .
monsieur Berger , the ring .
could I see it again ?
champagne cocktail , please .
I recognize you from the news photographs , Monsieur Laszlo .
in a concentration camp , one is apt to lose a little weight .
we read five times that you were killed in five different places .
as you see , it was true every single time .
thank heaven I found you , Berger .
I &apos;m looking for a man by the name of Ugarte .
he &apos;s supposed to help me .
Ugarte cannot even help himself .
he &apos;s under arrest for murder .
he was arrested here tonight .
I see .
but we who are still free will do all we can .
we are organized .
underground , like everywhere else .
tomorrow night there is a meeting at the Caverne du Bois .
if you will come--
will you ask the piano player to come over here ?
very well , mademoiselle .
- How &apos;s the jewelry business , Berger ?
check , please .
too bad you weren &apos;t here earlier .
we had quite a bit of excitement , didn &apos;t we , Berger ?
Yes .
excuse me , gentlemen .
- My bill . - No . two champagne cocktails .
- Hello , Sam . - Hello , Miss Ilsa .
I never expected to see you again .
it &apos;s been a long time .
Yes , ma &apos;am .
a lot of water under the bridge .
- Some of the old songs , Sam .
- Yes , ma &apos;am .
where is Rick ?
I don &apos;t know . I ain &apos;t seen him all night .
- When will he be back ?
- Not tonight no more . he ain &apos;t coming--
- Does he always leave so early ?
- He never-- Well , he &apos;s got a girl up to the Blue Parrot .
goes up there all the time .
you used to be a much better liar , Sam .
leave him alone , Miss Ilsa .
you &apos;re bad luck to him .
play it once , Sam . for old times &apos; sake .
I don &apos;t know what you mean , Miss Ilsa .
play it , Sam .
play &quot; As Time Goes By . &quot;
I can &apos;t remember it , Miss Ilsa .
I &apos;m a little rusty on it .
I &apos;ll hum it for you .
sing it , Sam .
Sam , I thought I told you never to play--
well , you were asking about Rick , and here he is .
may I present-- - Hello , Ilsa . - Hello , Rick .
Oh , you &apos;ve already met Rick , mademoiselle ?
then perhaps you also--
this is Mr. Laszlo .
- How do you do ? - How do you do ?
one hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca .
and about Victor Laszlo everywhere .
- Won &apos;t you join us for a drink ? - Rick never--
- Thanks , I will .
- Well a precedent is being broken . Emile .
- Interesting café .
I congratulate you . - I congratulate you .
- What for ?
- Your work .
thank you . I try .
we all try .
you succeed .
she was asking about you earlier , Rick , in a way that made me extremely jealous .
I wasn &apos;t sure you were the same .
- Let &apos;s see , the last time we met--
- Was La Belle Aurore .
how nice . you remembered .
but , of course , that was the day the Germans marched into Paris .
not an easy day to forget .
I remember every detail .
the Germans wore gray , you wore blue .
Yes . I put that dress away .
when the Germans march out I &apos;ll wear it again .
Ricky , you &apos;re becoming quite human .
I suppose we have to thank you for that .
Ilsa , I don &apos;t wish to be the one to say it , but it &apos;s late .
so it is . we have a curfew in Casablanca .
it would never do for the chief of police to be found drinking after hours .
- I hope we didn &apos;t overstay our welcome .
- Not at all . - Your check , sir .
- It &apos;s my party .
another precedent gone .
this has been a very interesting evening .
I &apos;ll call you a cab . gasoline rationing , time of night .
- We &apos;ll come again . - Anytime .
- Say good night to Sam for me . - I will .
there &apos;s still nobody in the world who can play &quot; As Time Goes By &quot; like Sam .
he hasn &apos;t played it in a long time .
- Good night .
- Good night .
a very puzzling fellow , this Rick .
what sort is he ?
I really can &apos;t say , though I saw him quite often in Paris .
- Tomorrow at 10 , at the prefect office .
- We &apos;ll be there .
- Good night . - Good night .
boss ?
- Boss , ain &apos;t you going to bed ?
- Not right now .
ain &apos;t you planning on going to bed in the near future ?
- You ever going to bed ?
- No .
well , I ain &apos;t sleepy , either .
good , then have a drink .
- Not me , boss .
- Then don &apos;t have a drink . boss , let &apos;s get out of here .
no , sir . I &apos;m waiting for a lady .
please , let &apos;s go .
ain &apos;t nothing but trouble for you here .
she &apos;s coming back . I know she &apos;s coming back .
we &apos;ll take the car and drive all night .
we &apos;ll get drunk .
we &apos;ll go fishing , stay away until she &apos;s gone .
- Shut up and go home , will you ?
- No , sir , I &apos;m staying right here .
they grab Ugarte , then she walks in .
that &apos;s the way it goes . one in , one out .
- Sam . - Yes , boss ?
if it &apos;s December 1941 in Casablanca , what time is it in New York ?
what ?
my watch stopped .
I bet they &apos;re asleep in New York .
I bet they &apos;re asleep all over America .
of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world she walks into mine .
- What &apos;s that you &apos;re playing ?
- A little something of my own . - Well , stop it .
you know what I want to hear .
- No , I don &apos;t . you played it for her .
you can play it for me . - I don &apos;t think I can remember--
- If she can stand it , I can .
play it .
Yes , boss .
who are you really ?
and what were you before ?
what did you do , and what did you think ?
we said no questions .
here &apos;s looking at you , kid .
a franc for your thoughts .
in America they &apos;d bring only a penny .
I guess that &apos;s about all they &apos;re worth .
I &apos;m willing to be overcharged .
tell me .
well , I was wondering ...
why I &apos;m so lucky .
why I should find you waiting for me to come along .
why there is no other man in my life ?
that &apos;s easy . there was .
he &apos;s dead .
I &apos;m sorry for asking .
I forgot we said no questions .
only one answer can take care of all our questions .
nothing can stop them now .
Wednesday , Thursday at the latest , they &apos;ll be in Paris .
Richard , they &apos;ll find out your record .
you won &apos;t be safe here . I &apos;m on their blacklist already .
their roll of honor .
Henri wants us to finish this bottle and then three more .
says he &apos;ll water his garden with champagne before he &apos;ll let the Germans drink it .
this sort of takes the sting out of being occupied , doesn &apos;t it ?
you said it .
here &apos;s looking at you , kid .
my German &apos;s a little rusty .
it &apos;s the Gestapo .
they say they expect to be in Paris tomorrow .
they &apos;re telling us how to act when they come marching in .
with the whole world crumbling , we pick this time to fall in love .
it &apos;s pretty bad timing .
- Where were you , say , 10 years ago ?
- 10 years ago ?
let &apos;s see .
Yes , I was having a brace put on my teeth .
where were you ?
looking for a job .
was that cannon fire ?
or is it my heart pounding ?
it &apos;s the new German 77th , and judging by the sound , only about 35 miles away .
and getting closer every minute .
here , here , drink up .
we &apos;ll never finish the other three .
them Germans will be here pretty soon , and they &apos;ll come looking for you .
and don &apos;t forget , there &apos;s a price on your head .
I left a note in my apartment .
they &apos;ll know where to find me .
it &apos;s strange . - I know so very little about you .
- I know very little about you .
just the fact that you had your teeth straightened .
be serious , darling .
you are in danger .
you must leave Paris . no , we must leave .
Yes , of course .
we . the train for Marseilles leaves at 5 : 00 .
I &apos;ll pick you up at your hotel at 4 : 30 .
not at my hotel .
I ... I have things to do in the city before I leave .
I &apos;ll meet you at the station .
all right , at a quarter to 5 .
why don &apos;t we get married in Marseilles ?
that &apos;s too far ahead to plan .
Yes . I guess it is too far ahead .
let &apos;s see ... What about the engineer ?
why can &apos;t he marry us on the train ?
why not ? the captain on a ship can .
it doesn &apos;t seem fair that--
Hey , what &apos;s wrong , kid ?
I love you so much .
and I hate this war so much .
it &apos;s a crazy world .
anything can happen .
if you shouldn &apos;t get away ...
if something should keep us apart wherever they put you and wherever I &apos;ll be , I want you to know that I ...
kiss me .
kiss me as if it were the last time .
where is she ?
have you seen her ?
I can &apos;t find her .
she checked out of the hotel .
but this note came just after you left .
that &apos;s the last call , Mr. Richard .
do you hear me ?
come on , Mr. Richard .
let &apos;s get out of here . come on .
Rick , I have to talk to you .
I saved my first drink to have with you .
here . - No , Rick . not tonight .
- Especially tonight .
why did you have to come to Casablanca ?
there are other places .
I wouldn &apos;t have come if I &apos;d known you were here .
believe me , Rick , it &apos;s true .
I didn &apos;t know . it &apos;s funny about your voice , how it hasn &apos;t changed .
I can still hear it .
&quot; Richard , dear , I &apos;ll go with you anyplace .
- We &apos;ll get on a train and never stop . &quot;
- Don &apos;t , Rick .
I can understand how you feel .
you understand how I feel .
how long was it we had , honey ?
- I didn &apos;t count the days .
- Well , I did . every one of them .
mostly I remember the last one .
the wild finish .
a guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face because his insides have been kicked out .
can I tell you a story , Rick ?
does it got a wild finish ?
I don &apos;t know the finish yet .
go on , tell it .
maybe one &apos;ll come to you as you go along .
it &apos;s about a girl who had just come to Paris from her home in Oslo .
at the house of some friends she met a man about whom she &apos;d heard her whole life .
a very great and courageous man .
he opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals .
everything she knew or ever became was because of him .
and she looked up to him and worshiped him with a feeling she supposed was love .
Yes , that &apos;s very pretty .
I heard a story once .
in fact , I &apos;ve heard a lot of stories in my time .
they went along with the sound of a tinny piano playing in the parlor downstairs .
&quot; mister , I met a man once when I was a kid , &quot; they &apos;d always begin .
I guess neither one of our stories is very funny .
tell me who was it you left me for ?
was it Laszlo , or were there others in between or aren &apos;t you the kind that tells ?
I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the letters of transit with Mr. Blaine .
I would suggest you search the café immediately .
if Rick has the letters , he &apos;s too smart to let you find them there .
you give him credit for too much cleverness .
my impression was he &apos;s just another blundering American .
we mustn &apos;t underestimate American blundering .
I was with them when they blundered into Berlin in 1918 .
as to Laszlo , we want him watched 24 hours a day .
it may interest you to know that at this very moment he &apos;s on his way here .
there is nothing we can do . I &apos;m delighted to see you .
did you have a good night &apos;s rest ?
I slept very well .
strange . nobody &apos;s supposed to sleep well in Casablanca .
- May we proceed with the business ?
- With pleasure . won &apos;t you sit down ?
Laszlo , we will not mince words .
you &apos;re an escaped prisoner of the Reich .
so far you have been fortunate in eluding us .
you have reached Casablanca .
it is my duty to see that you stay in Casablanca .
whether or not you will succeed is problematic .
not at all . Renault &apos;s signature is necessary on every visa .
Captain , is it possible that Laszlo will receive a visa ?
I &apos;m afraid not . my regrets , monsieur .
well , perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca .
and mademoiselle ?
- You needn &apos;t be concerned about me .
- Is that all you wish to tell us ?
don &apos;t be in such a hurry . you have all the time in the world .
you may be in Casablanca indefinitely .
or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow .
- On one condition .
- And that is ?
you know the leader of the underground movement in Paris , in Prague Brussels , Amsterdam Oslo , Belgrade , Athens ...
- Even Berlin .
- Yes , even in Berlin .
if you will furnish me with their names and whereabouts you &apos;ll have your visa in the morning .
and the honor of having served the Third Reich .
I was in a German concentration camp for a year .
- That &apos;s honor enough for a lifetime .
- You will give us the names ?
if I didn &apos;t give them to you in a concentration camp where you had more persuasive methods at your disposal I certainly won &apos;t give them to you now .
and what if you track down these men and kill them ?
what if you murdered all of us ?
from every corner of Europe , hundreds , thousands would rise to take our places .
even Nazis can &apos;t kill that fast .
Herr Laszlo , you have a reputation for eloquence which I can now understand .
but in one aspect you are mistaken .
you said the enemies of the Reich could all be replaced . but there is one exception .
no one could take your place if anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape .
you won &apos;t dare to interfere with me here .
this is still unoccupied France .
any violation of neutrality would reflect on Captain Renault .
- Monsieur , insofar as it is in my power .
- Thank you . by the way , monsieur , last night you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte .
I believe you have a message for him ?
nothing important . but may I speak to him now ?
you would find the conversation a trifle one-sided .
Signor Ugarte is dead .
I &apos;m making out the report now .
we haven &apos;t quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape .
- Are you quite finished with us ?
- For the time being . good day .
undoubtedly , their next step will be to the black market .
excuse me , captain .
another visa problem has come up .
- Show her in . - Yes , sir .
sorry , monsieur , we were never to handle the police .
- This is a job for Signor Ferrari .
- Ferrari ?
it can be most helpful to know Signor Ferrari .
he pretty near has a monopoly on the black market here .
you will find him at the Blue Parrot .
thanks .
don &apos;t be too downhearted .
perhaps you can come to terms with Renault .
thank you very much , signor . - Hello , Ferrari .
- Good morning , Rick . the bus is in .
I &apos;ll take my shipment with me .
I &apos;ll have it sent over .
have a drink with me . I never drink in the morning .
and every time you send my shipment over it &apos;s a little short .
carrying charges , my boy . carrying charges . here , sit down .
there is something I want to talk over with you , anyhow .
bourbon .
the news about Ugarte upsets me very much .
you &apos;re a fat hypocrite .
you don &apos;t feel any sorrier for Ugarte than I do .
of course not .
what upsets me is that Ugarte is dead and no one knows where those letters are .
practically no one .
if I had those letters , I could make a fortune .
so could I , and I &apos;m a poor businessman .
I have a proposition for whoever has those letters .
I &apos;ll handle the entire transaction .
get rid of the letters , take all the risk , for a small percentage .
and the carrying charges ? naturally there will be a few incidental expenses .
that &apos;s my proposition for whoever has those letters .
I &apos;ll tell him when he comes in .
Rick , I think you know where those letters are .
you &apos;re in good company . Renault and Strasser probably think so too .
that &apos;s why I came here .
to give them a chance to ransack my place .
Rick , don &apos;t be a fool .
take me into your confidence . you need a partner .
excuse me , I &apos;ll be getting back .
- Morning . - Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at the table .
you will not find a treasure like this in all Morocco .
only 700 francs .
- You &apos;re being cheated . - Doesn &apos;t matter , thank you .
for friends of Rick &apos;s we have a small discount .
did I say 700 francs ?
you can have it for 200 .
I &apos;m sorry I was in no condition to receive you when you called on me last night .
doesn &apos;t matter .
for special friends of Rick &apos;s we have a special discount . 100 francs .
your story had me a little confused .
or maybe it was the bourbon .
I have some tablecloths , napkins-- - Thank you . I &apos;m really not interested .
- Please , one minute .
why did you come back ? to tell me why you ran out on me at the railway station ?
Yes .
well , you can tell me now . I &apos;m reasonably sober .
I don &apos;t think I will , Rick .
why not ? after all , I got stuck with a railway ticket .
I think I &apos;m entitled to know .
last night I saw what has happened to you .
the Rick I knew in Paris , I could tell him , he &apos;d understand .
but the one who looked at me with such hatred ...
I &apos;ll be leaving Casablanca soon . we &apos;ll never see each other again .
we knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris .
if we leave it that way , maybe we &apos;ll remember those days and not Casablanca .
did you run out on me because you knew what it would be like ?
hiding from the police , running away all the time ?
you can believe that if you want to .
well , I &apos;m not running away anymore . I &apos;m settled now .
above a saloon , it &apos;s true but walk up a flight I &apos;ll be expecting you .
all the same , someday you &apos;ll lie to Laszlo .
you &apos;ll be there .
no , Rick . no .
you see , Victor Laszlo is my husband .
and was , even when I knew you in Paris .
I was just telling Monsieur Laszlo that unfortunately I &apos;m not able to help him .
you see , my dear , word has gone around .
as leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca , I am influential and respected .
but it would not be worth my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo .
you , however , are a different matter .
Signor Ferrari thinks it might just be possible to get an exit visa for you .
- You mean for me to go on alone ?
- And only alone .
I &apos;ll stay here and keep on trying .
I &apos;m sure in a little while--
might as well be frank , monsieur .
it would take a miracle to get you out .
the Germans have outlawed miracles .
we are only interested in two visas .
- Please , Ilsa , don &apos;t be hasty .
- No , Victor . you two will want to discuss this .
excuse me . I &apos;ll be at the bar .
no , Ilsa .
I won &apos;t let you stay here .
you must get to America . believe me , somehow I will get out and join you .
but if the situation were different if I had to stay and there were only visa for one would you take it ?
Yes , I would .
Yes , I see .
when I had trouble getting out of Lille , why didn &apos;t you leave me there ?
when I was sick in Marseilles for two weeks and you were in danger every minute why didn &apos;t you leave me then ?
I meant to , but something always held me up .
I love you very much , Ilsa .
your secret will be safe with me .
Ferrari is waiting for our answer .
not more than 50 francs .
we &apos;ve decided , Signor Ferrari .
for the present we will go on looking for two visas .
thank you very much . well , good luck , but be careful .
- You know you &apos;re being shadowed ?
- Of course . it becomes an instinct .
I observe that you , in one respect , are a very fortunate man .
I am moved to make one more suggestion .
why , I do not know . because it cannot possibly profit me .
have you heard about Ugarte and the letters of transit ?
Yes , something . those letters were not found on Ugarte when they arrested him .
- You know where they are ?
- Not for sure .
but I &apos;d guess that Ugarte left those letters with Monsieur Rick .
a difficult customer , that Rick .
one never knows what he &apos;ll do or why .
but it is worth a chance .
thank you very much . good day .
Goodbye . thank you for your coffee .
I shall miss that when we leave Casablanca .
gracious of you to share it with me . good day , mademoiselle .
- Monsieur . - Good day .
- Here &apos;s to you , sir . - Good luck .
- I &apos;d better be going . - My check , please .
I have to warn you , sir .
this is a dangerous place .
full of vultures . - Vultures everywhere .
thanks for everything . - Goodbye .
it has been a pleasure to meet you .
I &apos;m sorry .
monsieur Rick , you are getting to be your best customer .
well , drinking .
I &apos;m very pleased with you .
you &apos;re beginning to live like a Frenchman .
that was some going-over your men gave my place .
we barely got cleaned up in time to open .
I told Strasser he wouldn &apos;t find the letters here .
but I told my men to be especially destructive .
you know how that impresses Germans .
Rick , have you got those letters of transit ?
Louis , are you Pro-Vichy or Free French ?
serves me right for asking a direct question .
the subject is closed . it looks like you &apos;re a little late .
so Yvonne &apos;s gone over to the enemy .
who knows ?
in her own way , she may constitute an entire second front .
I think it &apos;s time for me to flatter Strasser a little .
I &apos;ll see you later . Sascha !
French 75s .
put up a whole row of them , Sascha .
starting here and ending here .
we will begin with two .
what did you say ?
would you kindly repeat it ?
- What I said is none of your business .
- I &apos;ll make it my business .
I don &apos;t like disturbances in my place .
either lay off politics or get out .
you see , captain ?
the situation is not as under control as you believe .
we try to cooperate with your government .
but we cannot regulate the feelings of our people .
Captain , are you certain which side you &apos;re on ?
I have no conviction , if that &apos;s what you mean .
I blow with the wind and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy .
and if it should change ?
surely the Reich doesn &apos;t admit that possibility ?
we are concerned about more than Casablanca .
we know that every French province in Africa is honeycombed with traitors .
waiting for their chance . waiting perhaps for a leader .
a leader ?
like Laszlo ? I have been thinking .
it &apos;s too dangerous to let him go , it may be too dangerous to let him stay .
I see what you mean .
thank you , Carl .
thank you , Carl .
sit down . have a brandy with us .
to celebrate our leaving for America tomorrow .
thank you very much .
I thought you would ask me , so I brought the good brandy and a third glass .
at last the day &apos;s came !
frau Leuchtag and I are speaking nothing but English now .
so we should feel at home when we get to America .
a very nice idea .
to America .
to America .
what watch ?
- Ten watch .
- Such much ?
you will get along beautifully in America .
how is lady luck treating you ?
Oh , too bad . you &apos;ll find him over there .
- Monsieur Rick ? - Yes ?
- Could I speak to you , please ?
- How &apos;d you get in here ?
you &apos;re underage .
- I came with Captain Renault .
- I should have known . my husband is with me too .
he is ?
Captain Renault &apos;s getting broad-minded .
sit down . have a drink ?
no , of course not . you mind if I do ?
monsieur Rick ...
- ... what kind of a man is Captain Renault ?
- Like any other man , only more so .
no , I mean is he trustworthy ? is his word-- ?
- Just a minute . who told you to ask me that ?
- He did . Captain Renault did .
I thought so . where &apos;s your husband ?
at the roulette table , trying to win enough for our exit visas .
Oh , of course he &apos;s losing .
- How long have you been married ?
- Eight weeks .
we come from Bulgaria .
things are very bad there .
the devil has the people by the throat .
so Jan and I , we ...
we do not want our children to grow up in such a country .
- So you decided to go to America .
- Yes .
but we haven &apos;t much money and traveling is so expensive and difficult .
it was much more than we thought to get here .
and then Captain Renault sees us ...
- ... and he is so kind , he wants to help us .
- Yes , I &apos;ll bet .
he tells me he can give us an exit visa .
but we have no money .
- Does he know that ?
- Yes .
- And he &apos;s still willing to give you a visa ?
- Yes . - And you want to know ... ?
- Will he keep his word ?
he always has .
you are a man .
if someone loved you very much so that your happiness was the only thing that she wanted in the world and she did a bad thing to make certain of it ...
- ... could you forgive her ?
- Nobody ever loved me that much .
and he never knew , and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart that would be all right , wouldn &apos;t it ?
- You want my advice ?
- Yes , please .
go back to Bulgaria .
Oh , but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe , to get to America ...
Oh , but if Jan should find out . he is such a boy .
in many ways I am so much older than he is .
Yes , well , everybody in Casablanca has problems .
- Yours may work out . you &apos;ll excuse me .
- Thank you , monsieur .
- Good evening .
- Good evening . - You see ? here we are again .
- I take that as a great compliment to Sam .
I suppose he means to you Paris of happier days .
he does . could we have a table close to him ?
and as far away from Major Strasser as possible .
the geography may be a little difficult to arrange .
- Paul , table 30 .
- Yes , sir . right this way , if you please .
I &apos;ll have Sam play &quot; As Time Goes By . &quot; I believe that &apos;s your favorite tune .
thank you .
- Two cognacs , please . - Cognac .
do you wish to place another bet , sir ?
no . no , I guess not . have you tried 22 tonight ?
I said 22 .
leave it there .
cash it in and don &apos;t come back .
are you sure this place is honest ?
honest ?
as honest as the day is long .
how are we doing tonight ?
a couple of thousand less than I thought there would be .
monsieur Rick ...
he &apos;s just a lucky guy .
monsieur Rick , may I get you a cup of coffee ?
- No , thanks , Carl . - Monsieur Rick ...
Captain Renault , may I-- ?
not here . come to my office in the morning .
we &apos;ll do everything businesslike .
- We &apos;ll be there at 6 .
- I &apos;ll be there at 10 . I &apos;m very happy for both of you .
still , it &apos;s very strange that you won .
well , maybe not so strange .
- I &apos;ll see you in the morning . - Thank you , Captain Renault . no !
boss , you &apos;ve done a beautiful thing .
go away , you crazy Russian .
- As I suspected .
you &apos;re a rank sentimentalist .
- Yeah ? why ?
why do you interfere with my little romances ?
put it down as a gesture to love .
well , I &apos;ll forgive you this time .
but I &apos;ll be in tomorrow night with a breathtaking blond .
and it &apos;ll make me very happy if she loses .
- Mr. Blaine , I wonder if I could talk to you .
- Go ahead . well , isn &apos;t there some other place ?
it &apos;s rather confidential , what I have to say .
- In my office . - Right .
you must know it &apos;s very important I get out of Casablanca .
it &apos;s my privilege to be one of the leaders of a great movement .
you know what I &apos;ve been doing .
you know what it means to the work , to the lives of thousands of people that I reach America and continue my work .
I &apos;m not interested in politics .
the problems of the world are not in my department .
I &apos;m a saloonkeeper .
my friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record .
you ran guns to Ethiopia .
- You fought against the fascists in Spain .
- What of it ?
isn &apos;t it strange you &apos;re always fighting on the side of the underdog ?
Yes , I found that a very expensive hobby .
but then I never was much of a businessman .
are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of 100,000 francs ?
- I appreciate it , but I don &apos;t accept it .
- 200,000 . my friend , you could make it a million francs or three .
my answer would still be the same .
there must be some reason why you won &apos;t let me .
there is . I suggest that you ask your wife .
- I beg your pardon ?
- I said , ask your wife . - My wife ?
- Yes .
play &quot; La Marseillaise . &quot; play it !
see what I mean ?
if Laszlo &apos;s presence in a café can inspire this demonstration what more will his presence in Casablanca bring on ?
I advise that this place be shut up at once .
- But everybody &apos;s having a good time .
- Yes , much too good a time . the place is to be closed .
- But I have no excuse to close it . - Find one .
everybody is to leave immediately .
this café is closed until further notice .
clear the room at once .
how can you close me up ?
I &apos;m shocked , shocked to find that gambling is going on in here .
- Your winnings , sir .
- Thank you . everybody out at once .
after this disturbance it is not safe for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca .
this morning you implied it wasn &apos;t safe to leave Casablanca .
that is also true , except for one destination :
occupied France . - Occupied France ?
- Under safe conduct from me .
of what value is that ?
you may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past .
- There are two other alternatives for him .
- What are they ?
the French authorities may find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here .
the other alternative ?
my dear , perhaps you have already observed that in Casablanca human life is cheap .
good night , mademoiselle .
- What happened with Rick ?
- We &apos;ll discuss it later .
our faithful friend is still there .
please don &apos;t go to the underground meeting tonight .
I must .
besides , it isn &apos;t often that a man gets to display heroics before his wife .
don &apos;t joke .
after Major Strasser &apos;s warning tonight , I &apos;m frightened .
tell you the truth , I &apos;m frightened too .
shall I remain here in a hotel room , hiding ?
or shall I carry on the best I can ?
whatever I &apos;d say , you would carry on .
Victor , why don &apos;t you tell me about Rick ?
what did you find out ?
- Apparently he has the letters .
- Yes ?
but no intention of selling them .
you &apos;d think if sentiment wouldn &apos;t persuade him , money would .
did he give any reason ?
- He suggested I ask you .
- Ask me ?
Yes , he said , &quot; Ask your wife . &quot;
I don &apos;t know why he said that .
well , our friend outside will think we &apos;ve retired by now .
I &apos;ll be going in a few minutes . - Ilsa , I ...
- Yes ?
when I was in the concentration camp were you lonely in Paris ?
Yes , Victor , I was .
I know how it is to be lonely .
is there anything you wish to tell me ?
no , Victor , there isn &apos;t .
I love you very much , my dear .
Yes , I know .
Victor , whatever I do , will you believe that I ... ?
you don &apos;t even have to say it .
I &apos;ll believe .
good night , dear . good night .
- Victor . - Yes , dear ?
be careful .
of course I &apos;ll be careful .
well , you are in pretty good shape , Herr Rick .
how long can I afford to stay closed ?
two weeks , maybe three .
maybe I won &apos;t have to . a bribe has worked before .
in the meantime , everybody stays on salary .
thank you , Herr Rick .
Sascha will be happy to hear it . I owe him money .
- You finish locking up , will you , Carl ?
- Then I am going to the meeting-- - Don &apos;t tell me where you &apos;re going . I won &apos;t .
good night .
good night , Mr. Rick .
- How did you get in ?
- The stairs from the street .
I told you this morning you &apos;d come around , but this is ahead of schedule .
well , won &apos;t you sit down ?
- Richard , I had to see you .
- &quot; Richard &quot; again . we &apos;re back in Paris .
your visit isn &apos;t connected by any chance with the letters of transit ?
seems as long as I have those letters I &apos;ll never be lonely .
ask any price you want , but you must give me the letters .
I went all through that with your husband . it &apos;s no deal .
I know how you feel about me but put your feelings aside for something more important .
I have to hear again what a great man your husband is what an important cause he &apos;s fighting for ?
it was your cause too .
in your own way , you were fighting for the same thing .
I &apos;m not fighting for anything anymore except myself .
I &apos;m the only cause I &apos;m interested in .
we loved each other once .
if those days meant anything at all to you--
I wouldn &apos;t bring up Paris if I were you .
it &apos;s poor salesmanship .
listen to me .
if you knew what really happened , if you only knew the truth--
I wouldn &apos;t believe you no matter what you said .
you &apos;d say anything now to get what you want .
you want to feel sorry for yourself , don &apos;t you ?
with so much at stake all you can think of is your feelings .
one woman has hurt you , and you take your revenge on the rest of the world .
you &apos;re a coward and a weakling .
no . Oh , Richard . I &apos;m sorry .
I &apos;m sorry , but you are our last hope .
if you don &apos;t help us , Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca .
what of it ?
I &apos;m going to die in Casablanca . it &apos;s a good spot for it .
now , if you &apos;ll-- All right .
I tried to reason with you .
I tried everything . now , I want those letters . - Get them for me .
- I don &apos;t have to . I got them right here .
put them on the table .
no .
for the last time , put them on the table .
if Laszlo and the cause mean so much to you , you won &apos;t stop at anything .
all right , I &apos;ll make it easier for you .
go ahead and shoot . you &apos;ll be doing me a favor .
Richard I tried to stay away .
I thought I would never see you again .
that you were out of my life .
the day you left Paris if you knew what I went through .
if you knew how much I loved you .
how much I still love you .
and then ?
it wasn &apos;t long after we were married that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia .
they needed him in Prague , but there the Gestapo were waiting for him .
just a two-line item in the paper :
&quot; Victor Laszlo apprehended .
sent to concentration camp . &quot; I was frantic .
for months I tried to get word .
then it came . he was dead .
shot trying to escape . I was lonely .
I had nothing , not even hope .
then I met you .
why weren &apos;t you honest with me ?
why did you keep your marriage a secret ?
it wasn &apos;t my secret , Richard .
Victor wanted it that way .
not even our closest friends knew about our marriage .
that was his way of protecting me .
I knew so much about his work .
if the Gestapo found out I was his wife it would be dangerous for me and for those working with us .
and when did you first find out he was alive ?
just before you and I were to leave Paris together .
a friend came and told me that Victor was alive .
they were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of Paris .
he was sick . he needed me .
I wanted to tell you , but I didn &apos;t dare .
I knew you wouldn &apos;t have left Paris , and the Gestapo would have caught you .
well well , you know the rest .
well , it &apos;s still a story without an ending .
what about now ?
now ?
I don &apos;t know .
I know that I &apos;ll never have the strength to leave you again .
and Laszlo ?
you &apos;ll help him now , Richard , won &apos;t you ?
you &apos;ll see that he gets out . then he &apos;ll have his work .
all that he &apos;s been living for .
all except one . he won &apos;t have you .
I can &apos;t fight it anymore . I ran away from you once .
Oh , I don &apos;t know what &apos;s right any longer .
you have to think for both of us .
for all of us . all right .
I will .
here &apos;s looking at you , kid .
I wish I didn &apos;t love you so much .
- I think we lost them .
- Yes . - I &apos;m afraid they caught some of the others .
- Come inside .
come , Mr. Laszlo , I will help you immediately .
Carl , what happened ?
the police break up our meeting , Herr Rick .
we escaped at the last moment .
- Come up here a minute . - Yes , I come .
turn out the light in the rear entrance .
it might attract the police .
- But Sascha always puts out that light .
- Tonight he forgot .
Yes , I come . I will do it .
- I want you to take Miss Lund home . - Yes , sir .
it &apos;s nothing , just a little cut .
we had to get through a window . this might come in handy . thank you .
- Had a close one , eh ?
- Yes , rather .
don &apos;t you sometimes wonder if it &apos;s worth all this ?
I mean , what you &apos;re fighting for .
we might as well question why we breathe .
if we stop breathing , we &apos;ll die .
if we stop fighting our enemies , the world will die .
what of it ? then it &apos;ll be out of its misery .
you know how you sound , Monsieur Blaine ?
like a man who &apos;s trying to convince himself of something he doesn &apos;t believe in his heart .
each of us has a destiny .
for good , or for evil .
- I get the point . - I wonder if you do .
I wonder if you know that you &apos;re trying to escape from yourself and that you &apos;ll never succeed .
you seem to know all about my destiny .
I know a good deal more about you than you suspect .
I know that you &apos;re in love with a woman .
it &apos;s perhaps a strange circumstance that we both should be in love with the same woman .
the first evening I came into this café I knew there was something between you and Ilsa .
since no one is to blame I demand no explanation .
I ask only one thing . you won &apos;t give me the letters of transit .
all right . but I want my wife to be safe .
I ask you as a favor to use the letters to take her away from Casablanca .
you love her that much ?
apparently you think of me only as the leader of a cause .
well , I am also a human being .
Yes , I love her that much .
- Monsieur Laszlo ?
- Yes ? you &apos;ll come with us . we have a warrant for your arrest .
on what charge ?
Captain Renault will discuss that with you later .
it seems that destiny has taken a hand .
you haven &apos;t any proof , and you know it .
this isn &apos;t Germany or occupied France .
all you can do is fine him and give him 30 days .
you might as well let him go now .
I &apos;d advise you not to be too interested in what happens to Laszlo .
if you were to help him escape--
what makes you think I &apos;d stick my neck out for Laszlo ?
because , one , you bet 10,000 francs he &apos;d escape .
two , you &apos;ve got the letters of transit .
don &apos;t bother to deny it .
and you might do it simply because you don &apos;t like Strasser &apos;s looks .
as a matter of fact , I don &apos;t either .
they &apos;re all excellent reasons .
don &apos;t count too much on my friendship .
in this matter I &apos;m powerless .
besides , I might lose the 10,000 francs .
you &apos;re not very subtle , but you are effective .
I get the point . Yes , I have the letters . but I intend using them myself .
I &apos;m leaving Casablanca on tonight &apos;s plane .
the last plane .
and I &apos;m taking a friend with me . one you &apos;ll appreciate .
- What friend ?
- Ilsa Lund .
that ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape .
the last man I want to see in America .
you didn &apos;t come here to tell me this .
you have the letters of transit .
you can fill in your name and hers and leave anytime you please .
why are you still interested in what happens to Laszlo ?
I &apos;m not . but I am interested in what happens to Ilsa and me .
we have a legal right to go , that &apos;s true but people have been held in Casablanca in spite of their legal rights .
- What makes you think we want to hold you ?
- Ilsa is Laszlo &apos;s wife .
she probably knows things that Strasser would like to know .
Louis , I &apos;ll make a deal with you .
instead of this petty charge against him , you could get something big something that would chuck him in a concentration camp for years ...
- Be quite a feather in your cap , wouldn &apos;t it ? - Certainly .
Germany-- Vichy would be very grateful .
then release him .
you be at my place a half-hour before the plane leaves .
I &apos;ll have Laszlo come there to pick up the letters and that &apos;ll give you grounds to make the arrest .
you get him , and we get away .
to the Germans , that last will be just a minor annoyance .
there &apos;s still something about this I don &apos;t quite understand .
Miss Lund , she is very beautiful , yes but you were never interested in any woman .
- She isn &apos;t just any woman . - I see .
how do I know you &apos;ll keep your end of the bargain ?
I &apos;ll make the arrangements now with Laszlo in the visitor &apos;s pen .
I &apos;m gonna miss you .
you &apos;re the only one in Casablanca who has less scruples than I .
Oh , thanks .
go ahead , Ricky .
call off your watchdogs when you let him go .
I don &apos;t want them around this afternoon .
I &apos;m taking no chances , Louis , not even with you .
should we draw up papers , or is a handshake good enough ?
certainly not good enough .
but since I &apos;m in a hurry , it &apos;ll have to do . to get out of Casablanca and go to America ...
you &apos;re a lucky man .
my agreement with Sam is that he gets 25 percent of the profits .
that still goes . I happen to know he gets 10 percent .
but he &apos;s worth 25 . abdul , Carl and Sascha , they stay with the place or I don &apos;t sell .
of course .
Rick &apos;s wouldn &apos;t be Rick &apos;s without them .
well , so long .
don &apos;t forget you owe Rick &apos;s 100 cartons of American cigarettes .
I shall remember to pay it to myself .
- You &apos;re late .
- I was informed when Laszlo left the hotel so I knew I &apos;d be on time .
- I asked you to tie up your watchdogs .
- He won &apos;t be followed here .
this place will never be the same without you .
I know what you mean .
but I &apos;ve spoken to Ferrari . you &apos;ll still win at roulette .
- Is everything ready ?
- I have the letters right here .
when we searched the place , where were they ?
Sam &apos;s piano .
serves me right for not being musical .
here they are . you better wait in my office .
Victor thinks I &apos;m leaving with him .
haven &apos;t you told him ?
- Not yet .
- But you were able to arrange everything ?
everything is quite all right .
we &apos;ll tell him at the airport .
the less time to think , the easier . please trust me .
Yes , I will .
- I don &apos;t know how to thank you .
- Save it . we &apos;ve still lots of things to do . - I brought the money .
- Keep it , you &apos;ll need it in America .
- But we made a deal . - Never mind that .
- You won &apos;t have any trouble in Lisbon ?
- No . it &apos;s all arranged .
good . I &apos;ve got the letters here , made out in blank .
all you have to do is fill in the signatures .
Victor Laszlo .
Victor Laszlo , you &apos;re under arrest .
the charge of accessory to the murder of the couriers from whom the letters were stolen .
you &apos;re surprised about my friend Ricky ?
the explanation is simple . love , it seems , has triumphed over virtue .
not so fast , Louis .
nobody is going to be arrested . not for a while yet .
- Have you lost your mind ? - I have . sit down .
- Put that gun down .
- I don &apos;t want to shoot you but I will if you take one more step .
under the circumstances , I will sit down .
- Keep your hands on the table .
- I wonder if you realize what this means .
I do . we &apos;ve got time to discuss that later .
call off your watchdogs , you said .
just the same , call the airport and let me hear you tell them .
and remember , this gun is pointed right at your heart .
that is my least vulnerable spot .
Hello ? is that the airport ?
this is Captain Renault speaking .
there &apos;ll be two letters of transit for the Lisbon plane .
there &apos;s to be no trouble about them . good . Hello ?
my car , quickly ! this is Major Strasser .
have a squad of police meet me at the airport at once .
at once , do you hear ?
Hello , radio tower ?
Lisbon plane taking off in 10 minutes , east runway .
Visibility , 1 1 / 2 miles .
light ground fog . depth of fog approximately 500 .
ceiling unlimited . thank you .
have your man go with Laszlo and take care of his luggage .
certainly , Rick , anything you say .
- Find Laszlo &apos;s luggage . put it on the plane .
- Yes , sir . this way , please .
if you don &apos;t mind , fill in the names . that &apos;ll make it more official .
you think of everything , don &apos;t you ?
and the names are Mr. and Mrs. Victor Laszlo .
- But why my name , Richard ?
- Because you &apos;re getting on that plane .
I don &apos;t understand .
what about you ? I &apos;m staying with him till the plane gets away . no .
what has happened ?
last night you said--
last night we said a great many things .
you said I was to do the thinking for us .
I &apos;ve done a lot of it since then . it adds up to one thing :
you &apos;re getting on that plane with Victor where you belong .
now , you &apos;ve got to listen to me .
any idea what you &apos;d have to look forward to if you stayed here ?
chances are we &apos;d both wind up in a concentration camp . true , Louis ?
I &apos;m afraid Major Strasser would insist .
- You &apos;re saying this only to make me go .
- I &apos;m saying it because it &apos;s true .
inside of us we both know you belong with Victor .
you &apos;re part of his work , the thing that keeps him going .
if that plane leaves and you &apos;re not with him , you &apos;ll regret it .
maybe not today , maybe not tomorrow , but soon , and for the rest of your life .
but what about us ?
we &apos;ll always have Paris . we didn &apos;t have-
- We &apos;d lost it until you came to Casablanca .
we got it back last night .
- When I said I would never leave you .
- And you never will . but I &apos;ve got a job to do too .
where I &apos;m going , you can &apos;t follow . what I &apos;ve got to do you can &apos;t be any part of .
Ilsa , I &apos;m no good at being noble .
but it doesn &apos;t take much to see that the problems of three little people don &apos;t amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world .
someday you &apos;ll understand that .
now , now .
here &apos;s looking at you , kid .
- Everything is in order . - All except one thing .
there &apos;s something you should know .
I don &apos;t ask you to explain anything .
I &apos;m going to anyway . it may make a difference to you later on .
you said you knew about Ilsa and me .
you didn &apos;t know she was at my place last night when you were .
she came there for the letters of transit . isn &apos;t that true , Ilsa ?
Yes .
she tried everything to get them . nothing worked .
she did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me . but that was all over long ago .
for your sake , she pretended it wasn &apos;t , and I let her pretend .
I understand .
- Here it is . - Thanks . I appreciate it .
welcome back to the fight .
this time I know our side will win .
are you ready , Ilsa ?
Yes , I &apos;m ready . Goodbye , Rick .
God bless you .
you better hurry . you &apos;ll miss that plane .
I was right . you are a sentimentalist .
stay where you are . I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
what you just did for Laszlo .
that fairy tale you invented to send Ilsa away with him .
I know a little about women , my friend .
she went . but she knew you were lying .
anyway , thanks for helping me out .
I suppose you know this isn &apos;t going to be pleasant for either of us .
especially for you . - I &apos;ll have to arrest you , of course .
- As soon as the plane goes , Louis .
- What was the meaning of that phone call ?
- Victor Laszlo is on that plane .
why do you stand here ?
why don &apos;t you stop him ?
ask Monsieur Rick .
- Get away from that phone . - I advise you not to interfere .
I was willing to shoot Captain Renault , and I &apos;m willing to shoot you .
- Hello ! - Put that phone down . - Get me the radio tower .
- Put it down !
Major Strasser has been shot .
round up the usual suspects .
well , Rick , you &apos;re not only a sentimentalist , but you &apos;ve become a patriot .
maybe , but it seemed like a good time to start .
I think perhaps you &apos;re right .
it might be a good idea for you to disappear from Casablanca for a while .
there &apos;s a Free French garrison over at Brazzaville .
- I could be induced to arrange a passage .
- My letter of transit ? I could use a trip .
but it doesn &apos;t change our bet . you still owe me 10,000 francs .
that 10,000 francs should pay our expenses .
&quot; our &quot; expenses ?
Louis , I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship .
and may this be the fate of all the witches , warlocks , and sorcerers ... who attempt to work their evil magic within the township limits of Roxford .
the book of exorcism , please .
Mayest thou and thy kind be condemned forever to eternal flames ... never to return to the neighborhood of Roxford .
and now , while we prepare for the extinction of the father of this witch ... the old sorcerer who attempted to come to her aid ... there will be a short intermission .
popped maize .
get your fresh Indian popped maize , tuppence a poke .
it &apos;s buttered , it &apos;s hot , it &apos;s fresh .
an anti-witch charm in every poke .
tuppence , please .
popped maize . here we are .
it &apos;s buttered , it &apos;s fresh .
popped maize , Master Wooley ?
what has got into thee , Jonathan ?
- What ?
- Dost doubt she was a witch ?
I should never have accused her if I were not sure .
and her father .
Unquestionably a sorcerer .
mother , if thou hadst seen what I saw .
we both saw our cows turn pink , then blue and our sheep dancing a minuet .
- But thou didst not see Jennifer .
- Jennifer ?
she told me her name when she chased me into the hayloft .
she was young and beautifully fair fairer than all women that ever were .
how didst not tell that to the judges ?
because I could never describe her beauty .
what happened in the hayloft , Jonathan ?
she brought her golden tresses close to my face and whispered ...
&quot; Jonathan Wooley , thou hast denounced me as a witch .
for that thou shalt be accursed .
thou and thy children and thy children &apos;s children ... all will be under the same curse . &quot;
what was the curse ?
&quot; I and all my descendants will be unhappy in love .
the marriages we make will be disastrous until ... &quot;
Yes ?
- &apos; Tis too wicked to tell thee , Mother .
- Rubbish !
thou art in love with Purity Sykes and even betrothed to her .
- Aye , Mother .
- And Purity is a woman among thousands .
Aye , Mother , she is that .
Jonathan , wouldst leave thy future wife sit there all alone ?
- What ails him , Mistress Wooley ?
- Ah , Purity .
- You will find he is a dreamer .
- He needs only a firm hand .
Jonathan , I must ask thee to be more attentive .
- In the future ...
- Look !
the oak tree . &apos; Twill be planted over their ashes .
- Why ?
- To hold the evil spirits ... shh !
... prisoner in its roots ... thus keeping their wicked powers from surviving .
I hope .
and this is the tree which was planted over their ashes .
the witches &apos; spirits , of course ... are imprisoned in its roots .
imprisoned forever .
Martha ...
I have the honor to ...
- to ...
- Are you proposing to me ?
Yes , Martha .
Oh , Nathaniel !
what was that ?
fort Sumter fired upon !
war declared between the states !
Nancy ... Nancy , control yourself .
control yourself .
drop your hand .
I wish to throw this vase !
master Wooley , did you hear ?
war ! - Where is the nearest recruiting &apos; office ?
- Running off to war like a coward !
I &apos;m not talking about the whole house at the moment .
it &apos;s that living room !
Estelle !
now ... Now , listen to me !
Estelle !
Estelle .
Estelle , please .
- What ?
- Miss Masterson ?
please .
hold it .
one more .
Papa , I &apos;m leaving .
smile .
will you try to be more pleasant ?
at least until after the wedding .
fellow members of the Roxford Country Club ...
Dr. White &apos;s proposing another toast .
I realize that lovebirds ... would like to be out on the veranda whispering sweet nothings .
after a certain ceremony tomorrow ... they will have all the rest of their lives for billing and cooing .
mostly billing .
but if the voters have any sense at all , they will insist ... that the first four years of the honeymoon be spent in the governor &apos;s mansion !
go ahead .
you might pick up a few more votes .
- We want Wooley !
- We want Wooley !
we want Wooley !
we want Wooley !
I see getting married ... as well as trying to get elected , calls for speeches .
I can truly say ... that a new life is beginning for me .
all right ! ladies and gentlemen , it &apos;s just a storm .
ladies and gentlemen ... while at the moment , the future seems a little dark ...
well , you see ?
one never knows what the next moment will bring .
where am I ?
what &apos;s happened ?
a miracle !
an infernal miracle !
we &apos;re free again .
free at last !
- Who speaketh ?
- &apos; Tis I , thy father , Daniel .
but thou hast no substance .
nor hast thou , Jennifer .
we are smoke ... witches &apos; smoke .
but our evil spirits have survived .
&apos;Twill be sweet to plague the human race again .
first we &apos;ll visit the cornfield and ruin the crop .
&apos;Tis always a good way to limber up .
look , Father .
the cornfield is no longer there .
well , we must expect a few changes in 270 years .
- Were our spirits in the wood that long ?
- Aye . I counted the tree rings .
see ?
they &apos;ve built a new house .
- It seems all ablaze .
is it on fire ?
- Not yet !
what &apos;s knittin &apos; , kitten ?
you like to cut a rug ?
let &apos;s ditch these ickies .
how about goin &apos; to heaven in your jalopy ?
that &apos;s solid , Jackson .
now you &apos;re cookin &apos; on the front burner .
what language is that , Father ?
I don &apos;t know , but we &apos;ll learn it .
see how they dance today .
they stand so close .
well , well , well .
things have changed .
I never thought I &apos;d see clothes like that in New England .
these cannot be the descendants of the Puritans we knew .
there &apos;s something that hasn &apos;t changed in 270 years .
keep thy mind on our business !
&apos;Twould be nice to have lips ... lips to whisper lies ... lips to kiss a man and make him suffer .
father , why cannot I have lips and eyes and hair ?
careful .
someone &apos;s coming .
quick !
do as I do !
these bottles ... we &apos;ll hide in them .
quick ! quick , quick , quick , quick , quick !
Whee !
are you all right , Jennifer ?
&apos;Tis full of bubbles in here .
they tickle !
my bottle has the tang of maple rum !
look , Father !
come closer , man , so I can see thee better .
Riddle-dee-dee , riddle-dee-doe ... get thee hence and stub thy toe .
there was something familiar about that face .
- What &apos;ll it be , Mr. Wooley ?
- The same ... bourbon .
Yes , sir , Mr. Wooley .
Wooley !
I knew I recognized those features .
well , well , well .
a descendant of the man who had us burned .
no wonder he looks so unhappy .
I put a curse upon his family .
well , I thought lovebirds always flew around in pairs .
Estelle &apos;s talking politics .
- What &apos;s the matter ?
election jitters ?
- No . how can I lose , with Masterson and all his papers in back of me ?
my future father-in-law has never backed a loser .
you know that . if he spoils his record this time , I &apos;ll have to hock my stethoscope . I know that .
you &apos;re betting on a sure thing , Dudley .
he isn &apos;t missing a trick .
look at that .
posters at a private party .
the whole marriage is just another campaign stunt to him ... insisting we hold it the day before the election ... so I &apos;ll get a good publicity break on election day .
Wallace , I think you &apos;ve had enough to drink .
- Now , Estelle ...
- I &apos;d like to go home .
- Yes , dear .
can we drop you , Dudley ?
- Yes , thanks .
the curse is working .
she has the look of a shrew !
here , Tom .
Jennifer , what &apos;s that curse thou wast chattering about ?
each Wooley must marry the wrong woman .
ha !
what a curse !
every man who marries , marries the wrong woman .
true suffering cometh , when a man is in love with the woman he cannot marry .
father , suppose a man were in love with a witch .
- With me .
I would not marry him .
- Ha ! Ooh , pardon me .
I need air .
# For tonight I &apos;ll merry , merry be #
# Tomorrow I &apos;ll be sober # Let &apos;s get out of here .
let &apos;s go for a little ride .
broom !
- Father , give me a body .
- Oh , no .
thou didst get into enough trouble with thy last one .
thou canst not give me a body .
thou wouldst not even know how to begin .
no ?
I &apos;d merely make a little fire .
as thy last body was destroyed by flame thy new one would be born in flame !
prove it .
start that great house on fire .
a hotel for pilgrims .
&apos;Twould be a pleasure burning that .
all right , I will .
worra , worra , fizzle , dizzle ... let the flame begin to sizzle !
P-I-L-G-R-I-M ...
H-O-T-E-L !
Good-bye , Father .
Good-bye , Jennifer .
be a bad girl .
- That &apos;s the Pilgrim Hotel !
- It would have to be on our way home .
we &apos;ll have to stop .
you wouldn &apos;t go through fire for your future wife ?
boy , look at those flames .
I never saw such a fire .
- Is there any way we can get through ?
- Sorry , Mr. Wooley .
it &apos;s all blocked off .
- Some firebug must &apos;ve touched this off .
- He did a good job !
this is the craziest fire I &apos;ve ever seen !
laps up water like a cat !
- You &apos;re sure everybody got out , alright ?
- Yes , sir . we &apos;ve checked every room .
Yeah , they &apos;re all accounted for .
it &apos;s all right , men .
everybody &apos;s safe .
get these people back .
we &apos;re stuck here for a while .
tell them who you are .
they &apos;ll have to make way .
- I &apos;m sorry , Estelle .
- Wallace , where are you going ?
there &apos;s Mr. Wooley !
- Make way for Wooley .
- Make way for the next governor .
- Would you like to go through ?
- Yes , thank you .
folks , let him get by .
- I &apos;m voting for you .
- There goes a great guy .
- Hello , Mr. Wooley .
- Hello .
don &apos;t get too close .
I got a bet riding on you .
- How did it happen ?
- Nobody seems to know .
there was an explosion on the roof .
the top floor went like that .
then the fifth , then the fourth .
now it &apos;s on the third .
soon it &apos;ll be on the second , and then the first ... then it &apos;ll all cave in on the basement .
- What &apos;s so funny ?
- Oh , it &apos;s fully insured ... and I love building new things .
I want to build it in a classic gothic design .
- Don &apos;t you love gothic ? huh ?
- Quiet .
what was that ?
did you hear that voice ?
somebody &apos;s inside .
listen !
I didn &apos;t hear anything .
it was so clear !
a woman &apos;s voice .
Aw , there &apos;s nobody in there .
they &apos;ve looked everywhere .
no , wait .
wait .
there it is again !
here I am , Mr. Wooley .
- Over here .
- Where ?
I ...
I can &apos;t see !
just walk .
you &apos;ll find me .
keep walking .
this way .
this way .
- Are you all right ?
- I think so .
two legs , two arms , a face , hair .
- Yes , I seem to be complete .
- Why don &apos;t you come out ?
I &apos;ve been waiting for you , Mr. Wooley .
- Where are you ?
- You &apos;re getting warmer .
here &apos;s my hand .
how can I get you out ?
I can &apos;t see a thing .
I can see you .
how do you do ?
never mind .
let &apos;s get out of here !
- Just a moment , h ave you a gazing glass ?
- A what ? a mirror .
I want to see what I look like .
- At a time like this ?
- Oh , I &apos;m cold .
- Cold ?
in this furnace ?
- But I have no clothes .
no clothes ?
here , put this on .
how did you get here ?
from the top floor .
why do you look away ?
am I not pretty ?
who cares ?
come on .
get up , get up !
I can &apos;t !
here , I &apos;ll carry you .
legs are funny when you &apos;re not used to them , aren &apos;t they ?
- Huh ?
- Why are you in such a hurry ?
why ?
the whole building was on the third floor , and now it &apos;s fallen to the second .
when this ceiling gives way , we &apos;ll be buried alive .
nothing will happen to us .
- You don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
- Yes , I do .
Ah !
here &apos;s a door !
here !
this way &apos;s blocked .
the bars on the window .
quick ...
- Where are you ?
- I &apos;ve found a better coat .
and a mirror !
Mm , not bad .
Oh , I &apos;m a blond .
would you rather I be a brunette ?
if you don &apos;t get out of this fire , you &apos;ll be a redhead !
don &apos;t you realize ...
that was the second floor .
well , there &apos;s no way out .
we &apos;re goners , little girl .
perhaps I should be little .
I &apos;m just as high as your heart .
did you hear what I said ?
we &apos;re trapped .
just we two .
look , before I got here ... what ... what hit you on the head ?
I felt nothing until your hand touched mine .
Oh , I see .
well , it was nice meeting you .
Oh , would you like to leave now ?
it would be a pleasure ... but that door is now a wall .
Oh .
then we can use the one behind the screen .
- Quick !
it &apos;s our only chance !
- I want to fix my hair .
come on , while you still have a head !
do you like blonds ?
may I get a picture ?
hold it right there .
he saved somebody !
all right , stand back , people .
- Are you all right ?
- I guess so .
- You certainly gave me a scare .
- Wally ...
- take me away from these people .
- Here , Dudley .
she &apos;s suffering from shock .
well , uh guess I &apos;d better take you to a hospital .
Oh , well , I hope she &apos;s all right .
it &apos;s only natural for you to be concerned .
Estelle , I &apos;ve told you a dozen times .
there &apos;s no point in ...
well ? it &apos;s amazing .
not a scratch on her .
not a burn .
- You must be relieved .
- You &apos;ve known me all my life .
she never met Wally .
the girl &apos;s suffering from delusions .
you see ?
she has delusions .
- Well , I haven &apos;t !
- Estelle , you must believe me !
- Listen to me .
- I &apos;ve never seen her before ... and I ...
I &apos;ll never see her again !
- Dear , you ought ...
- It &apos;s silly to drive me home and then back here .
- You need rest .
- Darling ...
I know best .
you have to get used to pleasing me sometimes .
- All right , dear .
- Ooh , you still smell of smoke .
- Good night , darling .
- Good night .
Susie , you know you can &apos;t come in until breakfast time .
Scat !
Scat !
Susie !
Susie !
Susie ?
Susie , where are you ?
Hello , darling .
- I thought you &apos;d never get rid of that girl .
- What are you doing here ?
waiting for you .
- But the hospital , the ...
- I didn &apos;t like it there .
how did you get here ?
you wouldn &apos;t believe me if I told you .
what am I to do with you ?
just look on me as an old friend of the family .
- But I never laid eyes on you before .
- Come here , Wally .
am I not an attractive female ?
- What &apos;s that got to do with your being here ?
- Am I ?
Yes , yes , you &apos;re very pretty .
- Take my hand again .
- Now , come .
I know you &apos;ve had a terrible experience .
and now a pleasant one .
you ... have a very nice hand .
and now it can shake mine good night .
- Your hand is cold .
- Well , so is yours .
Yes , good-good night .
let mine rest in yours a moment .
see ?
it &apos;s growing warmer .
well , that &apos;s fine .
that &apos;s fi ...
- Amusing-looking chap , isn &apos;t he ?
- Yes .
- Ancestor of mine .
- I &apos;m aware he is .
Jonathan Wooley .
he would have been more hospitable .
Oh , I don &apos;t think so .
well , I have a busy day tomorrow .
it &apos;s time for beddy-bye .
- Mm , take my hand again .
- You &apos;re becoming a problem .
- Am I ?
- Yes , and that is not the solution .
see , it isn &apos;t respectable for you to be sitting in a stranger &apos;s house .
- I like your resisting me .
- Oh , you do ?
- You know what I &apos;m going to do with you now ?
- Yes .
just , uh , get up , please .
- Where are you taking me , Wally ?
- We &apos;re going out .
night , Jonathan !
I &apos;m going to give you money , and you can go back wherever you came from .
- No , not yet .
- Yes , right now !
Ooh , this is a lovely sensation .
even nicer than flying .
- What &apos;s going on , Governor ?
- Not &quot; Governor &quot; yet , Fred .
she was in a fire and lost her clothes .
no , I didn &apos;t .
I didn &apos;t have any .
- Evening , Mr. Wooley .
- Have you any money , Joe ?
- About eight bucks .
- Well , I only have ten , but here .
give it all to her and take her anyplace she wants to go .
I &apos;ll pay you tomorrow .
for heaven &apos;s sake , be good .
what &apos;ll I do with the coat ?
when you &apos;re through with it , send it to the police .
it ...
it didn &apos;t belong to her .
I hope that cab is heated .
where to , lady ?
where to ?
- Oh .
- Hope I didn &apos;t butt in on a pleasant dream .
just wanted to make sure you &apos;re all right .
- You &apos;ve certainly earned a drink .
- I &apos;ll say I have .
upstairs you go .
get a good night &apos;s sleep .
I &apos;ll take this .
- Dudley , she was here !
- Who was here ?
the girl I saved in the fire . that &apos;s impossible .
when I left her in the hospital , she was sleeping like an angel .
well , that &apos;s some hospital .
she got away .
and some angel .
now , wait a minute , hmm ?
tell me this again slowly .
no , tomorrow .
I &apos;ve had enough for one day .
well , how about me ?
I &apos;ve got $ 10,000 tied up in this election .
if this gets out , you &apos;re a dead goose .
think of the scandal ... the night before your wedding .
nothing . that &apos;s it ... the election !
that girl was sent here by the opposition .
- They &apos;re trying to frame me .
- You &apos;re right .
Rainfogle and that bunch wouldn &apos;t stop at anything . did anybody see her ?
- Nobody who &apos;ll do any talking .
I &apos;ll put her down as an amnesia case .
give the police a description .
was she wearing that fur coat ?
maybe you &apos;d better not say anything to the police .
- Everything &apos;s all right now .
I got rid of her .
- Well , try and forget her , then .
you want a pill to make you sleep ?
no . no , thanks .
I &apos;m much calmer now .
- Oh , make sure the door locks .
- Okay .
relax , now .
good night , Wally .
now close this door , Wally .
I said close this door , Wally .
now come here .
I &apos;m coming .
my pajamas .
I don &apos;t want to call the police , but I know your whole scheme .
- You do ?
- And I know who &apos;s behind it all .
- You don &apos;t .
- Want me to mention names ?
- What names ?
- County Chairman Martin J. Rainfogle .
- That &apos;s a nice name .
- Want another ?
- Mm-hmm .
- State Senator Conrad O &apos;Hara Jr .
sheriff Peter L. Glasshauser and all his ward heelers .
- How much are they paying you ?
- Nothing .
Hmm ?
- You &apos;re just doing it for love , hmm ?
- Yes .
father thought it &apos;d be a good idea .
- Who is your father ?
- You &apos;ve never met him .
but he doesn &apos;t want this state to have a good administration .
father doesn &apos;t want any state to have a good administration .
- But he &apos;s out to get me particularly .
I am a pretty good judge of character ... and I don &apos;t think you &apos;re really a bad girl .
- Don &apos;t you ?
- You &apos;re very young .
I &apos;m older than you &apos;d guess .
I don &apos;t think you ought to go back to that father .
I &apos;d rather stay with you .
you would ?
you really would , wouldn &apos;t you ?
now I understand .
just because I was of some slight help in getting you out of that blazing inferno ... perhaps you are , momentarily , infatuated with me .
but it isn &apos;t love .
and I &apos;m not in love with you .
I guess this &apos;ll take longer than I planned .
I &apos;m afraid you have rather a romantic mind .
you see , love isn &apos;t just a matter of ... two people meeting under romantic circumstances .
love ... that is , love that is really worthwhile grows slowly .
real love is ...
like a painting .
Ah , yes .
Yes , there have been thousands and thousands of couples just like us ... going their separate ways , never realizing the other was waiting somewhere .
why , Romeo and Juliet knew right away .
that &apos;s what Shakespeare &apos;s trying to tell us .
of course , the case of Dante and Beatrice is a trifle different .
he saw her only once .
but in that moment , the whole world was bathed in a new light .
it wasn &apos;t just a humdrum world anymore , where you had to ... get up in the morning and meet a lot of stupid people .
who &apos;s that ?
- 8 : 00 , Mr. Wooley .
- What ?
- 8 : 00 .
- That &apos;s impossible .
but ... it &apos;s true !
- Good morning , Wally .
- Good morning , Jennifer .
it &apos;s fantastic .
it just seems like a few minutes since I came in .
don &apos;t you want your breakfast ?
you &apos;re as bad as when you were a little boy .
even on a day like this , I have to call you half a dozen times .
Oh , and what a ... what a beautiful day it is too .
happy is the bride that the sun ... shines on .
good morning .
Mmm !
that smells good !
you don &apos;t know how long it &apos;s been since I &apos;ve eaten .
- Mr. Wooley ...
- I &apos;ll explain later , Margaret .
- What can you possibly say ?
- Well , you ...
no , no , dear .
not like that .
first you butter them , hmm ?
and then a little syrup .
Mr. Wooley , I &apos;ve worked for your family for 30 years ... been almost a mother to you ... and to think that on this day , of all days ...
Oh , yes , and send up some evening gowns too , please .
you see , everything the young lady had was burned .
send them up right away , please . thank you .
you know , I think you &apos;ve broken my record for waffles .
well , Margaret likes nothing better than to make them .
those people are still downstairs waiting .
Margaret , these have made a great hit with her .
- What did you say ?
- Those people .
I told you they were here three batches of waffles ago .
you did ?
I don &apos;t remember .
uh , people waiting ? who ?
who are they ?
- You &apos;ll find out .
- Excuse me .
Mm , more waffles ?
there &apos;s no more batter .
Oh !
I &apos;m sorry , Margaret .
- Better be sorry for yourself .
- Huh ?
it &apos;s Miss Masterson downstairs , with her father .
who ?
Miss Masterson , the lady you &apos;re getting married to .
Oh !
- Good morning .
- Good morning .
I &apos;d forgotten you were going to drop in .
we didn &apos;t say we were .
what &apos;s the matter with you ?
have you seen the papers ?
I &apos;ve got you all over the front page . that &apos;s great .
dear , hadn &apos;t you better go ?
- It &apos;s bad luck for the groom to see the bride before the wedding .
- Don &apos;t be ridiculous .
saving that girl was the luckiest break .
you don &apos;t know what that can do for you .
I have a rough idea .
I &apos;ve arranged a special broadcast about the fire .
you &apos;re to be interviewed .
- I &apos;ll have you back by 11 : 00 .
- That &apos;s fine .
that gives me plenty of time .
shall we go ?
no , I &apos;m going to stay here .
I want to see about brightening up this antique shop .
- The photographers will be here .
- There &apos;s no time for that .
- Run along .
- I &apos;m a little on edge , with the wedding at noon .
I &apos;d feel much better if you came along . there .
that &apos;s a good girl .
excuse me .
I &apos;ll get my hat .
- How did that happen ?
- It just slammed shut .
I &apos;m terribly sorry .
there &apos;s rather a heavy draft ... blowing through the house today .
what &apos;s he going out with her for ?
why shouldn &apos;t he ?
he &apos;s going to marry her in less than two hours .
- As for you , young woman ...
- Oh , go to sleep .
after all my work !
no , I don &apos;t want to go .
two hours .
that doesn &apos;t give me much time .
I wish Father were here .
what seems to be the trouble ?
Oh , good morning , Father .
I need some advice .
he &apos;s tougher than I thought .
- I can &apos;t seem to make him love me .
- Thou art the veriest bungler .
I must have been drunk to give thee a body .
Oh , don &apos;t smoke so much , Father .
- Did something go wrong with thy philter ?
- My what ?
thy love philter .
thou gavest him one , I presume .
no .
I thought I could do it barehanded .
art thou a witch or a woman ?
prepare a love philter at once .
Dost thou recall the incantation ?
listen .
# Kettle , kettle on the hob #
# Hurry up and do thy job #
# Steam and hiss and while you do #
# Cook an all-compelling brew #
# So that he who sips will be #
# Slave to love &apos;s captivity #
now put in a cool place until ready .
- What will it taste like , Father ?
- Like cool water ...
- but &apos; twill set Master Wooley &apos;s blood on fire .
- Then I &apos;ll treat him like a slave .
I &apos;ll make him suffer , body and soul .
speaking of bodies , I have a notion to make a personal appearance myself .
of course , I &apos;ll have to burn a house down to do it .
not this one , Father .
I &apos;ve a better idea : the building he &apos;s in now .
- &apos; Twill force him back to me .
- Excellent !
good hunting , Jennifer .
&apos;Tis growing cool .
now we shall see if thou canst resist me .
get ready , Master Wooley .
- Not dressed yet ?
- I &apos;m lucky to be alive .
what &apos;s happened now ?
I was making a broadcast about the fire , and suddenly I was in another one .
- Mysterious explosion on the roof .
- Anybody hurt ?
no , we all got out all right .
what &apos;s wrong with this door ?
Margaret !
what are you two doing in my bedroom ?
what happened ?
Oh , I ... I must have dozed off .
go upstairs and get dressed .
where &apos;s the brandy ?
- Did you get rid of that girl ?
- &quot; That girl &quot; ?
Oh !
she must still be here .
well , she won &apos;t be here for long .
Ah , you listen to me , young lady .
come on , come on .
get up .
I &apos;m listening , Mr. Wooley .
why do you look at me that way ?
Oh ... my dress .
do you like it ?
I ... I don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s such a shock to see you dressed .
I mean ...
- you &apos;re beautiful .
- Enough to make a man fall in love ?
- Mere physical beauty isn &apos;t everything .
- That &apos;s what I thought .
- Now , look , Jennifer ...
- I don &apos;t like the tone of your voice .
I swallowed some smoke last night , and I just swallowed more now .
- But that &apos;s not going to stop me ...
- Wally wants a drink of water .
nice , cool water .
- Thank you .
now , all I have to say ...
- Drink it , Wally ... and then I &apos;ll be glad to hear anything you have to say .
you &apos;ll find out that no one named Wooley is able to stay away from me .
Oh , I &apos;m awfully sorry .
this is terrible .
Jennifer ! Jennifer !
can you hear me ?
Dudley !
come here !
Oh , you ... Here , here .
drink this .
there .
there , that &apos;s better .
now , how do you feel ?
I ... I feel strange .
- Hmm ?
- What happened ?
well , the picture fell .
does your head hurt ?
- My head ?
- Mm .
no .
it &apos;s my heart .
- It feels so light .
- Try not to talk .
Oh , but I must .
I must tell you how I feel .
Oh , Wally , you &apos;re so beautiful .
Dudley !
- Take my hand .
- Don &apos;t start that again .
Oh , my darling .
let that man alone !
Dudley , something really happened to her this time .
- She got a sock on the head .
that picture ...
- You did it in self-defense .
aren &apos;t you glad you drank it , Wally ?
- I didn &apos;t drink anything .
- What &apos;s she talking about ?
a drink of water .
I gave it to her when she was coming to .
you gave it to me ?
you should never force liquids on a person who &apos;s unconscious .
it may have serious consequences .
nervous reactions .
- Come on .
we &apos;re late .
- What are we going to do ?
- Lock her in this room .
- But , Dudley ...
come on , before she marries you .
stop worrying .
she can &apos;t get out .
I &apos;ll drive .
you &apos;re too nervous .
you &apos;ll have to get rid of her after the wedding .
poor little girl .
all alone in the world except for a no-good father .
don &apos;t ever jam your brakes on like that !
I didn &apos;t jam them .
it just stopped .
- I can &apos;t figure it out .
- What &apos;s that smoke ?
- What happened to him ?
- Who ?
the fellow we pulled out of the fire .
he &apos;s gone !
how do you like my body , Jennifer ?
not too old , not too young .
I &apos;m sorry I &apos;ve forgotten the formula for clothing .
I had to borrow this sheet from the ambulance .
by the by , has the potion been administered ?
Yes .
father , something went wrong with our plan .
- What ?
but that love philter never fails .
- It didn &apos;t . but ...
I drank it .
Nicodemus !
then you love him !
Yes , Father .
but he &apos;s about to marry someone else because of my ancient curse on the Wooleys .
do you think if I explained it all to him ...
by all means do .
telling a mortal you &apos;re a witch will only mean the end of you .
then what shall I do ?
he must not marry her .
you won &apos;t let him , will you ?
- Let me think .
- You could make him love me .
you can do anything you want .
Yes .
this problem should be fairly simple .
- Just leave it all to me .
- Oh , thank you , Father !
- Will you leave it to me ?
- I promise .
splendid .
I &apos;m still a little bit warm from the fire .
Jennifer , fetch me a pair of Master Wooley &apos;s breeches .
we &apos;re going to his wedding .
# I love you truly #
# Truly #
# Dear #
# Life with its sorrows #
# Life with #
# Its tears #
here , drink this . - What is it ?
- Novocain . 120 proof .
- Down fast , brother .
- If that girl ever gets out of my house ...
drink that . suppose she comes here ?
it &apos;ll be terrible for Estelle .
Oh , you &apos;ll be all right , and I &apos;ll be sitting pretty .
- # # &#91; Instrumental Interlude &#93;
- There &apos;s your cue .
just play &quot; I &apos;m a seeing-eye dog &quot; now .
- Can &apos;t you smile ?
- You know I wanted a church wedding .
you &apos;ve had everything else your own way .
the reception and ... I should never have given in to Wallace .
it &apos;s the last time .
she &apos;s not here .
stop worrying .
smile .
close that door !
it &apos;s a hurricane !
- My veil is ruined !
- Go back and wait .
I &apos;m terribly sorry .
there &apos;ll be a short delay till we get everything straightened out .
music , music !
sing something .
# I love you truly #
that &apos;s all I needed :
a hurricane on my wedding day .
never mind about that .
she just blew in !
- What ?
- I saw her in the doorway .
- What &apos;ll I do ?
- I &apos;ll think of something .
beloved , this is my father .
delighted , Master Wooley .
you &apos;ve made a mistake .
this is a private room .
it &apos;s rather crowded downstairs , and a bit windy .
be seated , Master Wooley .
I should like to have a talk with you .
look here .
I &apos;m being married in two minutes .
- I understand those were your plans .
- &quot; Were ? &quot; he is .
nothing you can do ...
- Would you excuse us ?
- Maybe you &apos;d better .
hurry up .
I &apos;ll stand guard .
let me fix your pretty tie .
you see , Father ?
he &apos;s just like a Greek god .
my little one tells me she was your overnight guest .
- Not at my invitation .
- Oh , no , Father .
the poor sweet didn &apos;t want me to stay .
were I an ordinary man , Master Wooley ... a horsewhipping would no doubt be in order .
but I am not an ordinary man .
while examining your dwelling ...
- I came upon ... this .
- My revolver !
you can &apos;t force me to marry her .
what a banal mind you have .
you may hold the weapon .
- What is this ?
- It &apos;s very simple .
here is a bruised flower .
I am her father .
that is your revolver .
you are going to shoot me .
I ... am going to shoot you ?
will that be of help ?
now , now .
father knows best .
warm , Master Wooley ?
you don &apos;t know what warmth is .
I am told one of your forebears made a hobby of bonfires .
what a pity he cannot be here ... to see his descendant burn .
Yes , Master Wooley .
burn .
in the modern way .
Strapped in a chair heated by electricity .
I anticipated that .
pistol , pistol , let there be ... murder in the first degree .
thank you so much .
amusing invention , the electric chair .
what will they think of ... next ?
- What &apos;s happened ?
- Uh ...
- It was an accident !
- &apos; Twas no accident .
he killed me in cold blood .
kindly notify the authorities .
Oh , he &apos;s frightened you .
he told me he &apos;d help me .
- How is he ?
- He &apos;s dead .
Oh , it doesn &apos;t matter .
&quot; doesn &apos;t matter &quot; ?
her own father !
Oh , but that &apos;s not my father .
that &apos;s just a body he picked up .
I didn &apos;t do it , Dudley !
you &apos;ll be my witness !
all right .
well , I wasn &apos;t here !
he &apos;s as nervous as a bride .
one might think they were going to hang him .
it &apos;s up to you .
now , tell them .
what have I got to do with it ?
you &apos;re handling the ... details of the wedding .
# I love you truly #
# Truly #
empty !
I thought I saw smoke come out .
I know you &apos;re here somewhere .
how could you , Father ?
you know I love him !
that &apos;s exactly why I &apos;ve disposed of him .
where are you ?
# For tonight I &apos;ll merry , merry be For tonight I &apos;ll merry , merry be #
# For tonight I &apos;ll merry , merry be #
# Tomorrow I &apos;ll be sober #
come out of that bottle .
- Come out !
- Oh , no .
I could float here forever .
well , you &apos;re not going to .
Wally !
don &apos;t go upstairs !
- But maybe she killed herself .
- Now , Wally ... Wally ...
- What &apos;s wrong with him ?
- I think we &apos;d better call the police .
- What &apos;s he done ?
- It &apos;s the other fellow .
- What other fellow ?
- The one in the chair .
keep calm .
I &apos;ll be right back .
Estelle !
Estelle !
# Ah , love , &apos; tis something #
# To feel #
now , you get back in that body .
no . I didn &apos;t like it .
it &apos;s an old , fat body .
then I &apos;ll tell Wally what we are .
knowing what would then happen to you ?
- Yes .
- Heh .
you wouldn &apos;t dare .
wouldn &apos;t I ?
you &apos;re all right ?
Wally , darling , there &apos;s something I must tell you .
look !
- I thought you said he was dead !
- Well , he is !
a fine way to take advantage of a father &apos;s affection .
now hearken to a father &apos;s curse .
I &apos;m going to turn you into a frog .
frog , frog , sitting on a log ...
what &apos;s the next line ?
you wait till I sober up .
you &apos;ll be sorry .
# For tonight I &apos;ll merry , merry be For tonight I &apos;ll merry , merry be #
# Tomorrow I &apos;ll be sober #
- What did you want the police for ?
- It &apos;s all right now . he fell out the window .
- He what ?
- Not Wally .
the other fellow .
- Unhand me , foul minions of the law !
- Take it easy , Pop .
I &apos;m going to cast a spell upon you .
from now on , you &apos;re a rat !
rat , rat , fatter than the cat ...
- How does the rest of it go ?
- So I &apos;m a rat , huh ?
- Call the wagon .
- Come on .
if I could only remember the words , I could turn you into kangaroos .
they &apos;re taking him away .
why didn &apos;t I have them take you too ?
perhaps because you &apos;re beginning to love me .
- Please don &apos;t start that again .
- Wally !
I thought Father would be friendly .
I wouldn &apos;t let him or anyone else harm you .
- Oh , I know you wouldn &apos;t .
- But it &apos;s true !
last night I was your enemy , but now I &apos;ve changed .
I love you .
I &apos;ll always love you .
- If I could die , I would do that for you .
- Will you just be a sweet girl ?
- Hey , they &apos;re ready .
- Good-bye .
- Where are you going ?
- I told you before ...
but I thought that now , after all I &apos;ve done for you ...
you &apos;ve been very obliging , but now I &apos;m going downstairs to be married .
that &apos;s what you think .
Ahhh ! Wally !
you gotta go through with it this time .
I &apos;ll take care of her .
# # &#91; &quot; Bridal March &quot; &#93; - Hurry up , hurry up .
let &apos;s get this over with .
- He &apos;ll pay for this .
- Do I look all right ?
- Who cares ?
go on .
well , what are you standing there for ?
Dudley has the ring .
I &apos;ll see what &apos;s keeping him .
- Wallace .
- You come back here !
what &apos;s the matter with you ?
did you ever have one of those days when nothing seems to go right ?
Wallace !
# I love you truly #
- Got here too late .
- Dudley .
she really did love me .
she said she &apos;d die for me .
- Oh , my darling .
- At last !
I &apos;ve had enough of this !
Estelle , wait a minute !
listen to me !
you &apos;ve got to listen to me !
uh ... It &apos;s a big misunderstanding .
if you &apos;ll give me a few minutes , I ...
I &apos;ll give you just ten seconds to get out of this house , all of you !
we won &apos;t be here that long .
- You &apos;d better get out of the state .
- I &apos;m terribly ...
- Get out !
- I can explain everything .
uh , after the fire , you see , she spent the ni-night ...
On-On second thought ...
- maybe we &apos;d better just go , darling .
- Mr. Masterson ...
I &apos;ll expose you in every paper I own !
this &apos;ll not only cost you the election , but I &apos;ll encourage the voters of this state to tear you limb from limb !
I &apos;ll head the tar-and-feather party personally !
when I &apos;m through with you , you &apos;ll wish you &apos;d never been born .
# I love you truly #
- Will you shut up ?
- # Tru ... #
extra ! big Wooley scandal !
read all about it !
extra ! paper !
big Wooley scandal !
extra ! read all about it !
Wallace Wooley exposed !
extra !
paper !
- Big Wooley scandal !
- What does it say ?
it &apos;s just as I thought .
he &apos;s finished .
and I &apos;m bankrupt .
go and get her , I say .
bring my daughter to me .
bring her here or , by Jezebel ...
- Shut up !
- Quiet !
- I wanna get some sleep !
- Hey , toss this stub bug out of here !
for the last time , will you pipe down ?
I tell you , my daughter ran off with a bumpkin ... named Wooley , Wallace Wooley .
sure , she did . you take it easy .
you &apos;ll be out of here tomorrow .
tomorrow may be too late !
there &apos;s no telling what she &apos;ll do .
I know a couple of ways to make you shut up .
and I know a hundred ways ... to silence you forever .
Oh , but I don &apos;t remember them now .
this is terrible !
she &apos;ll marry him .
Wallace Wooley &apos;s gonna marry his daughter .
Yeah ?
and then you &apos;ll see what &apos;ll happen to Master Wooley .
I &apos;ll wreak my vengeance on them both .
she thinks she can run away from me ... that I cannot see her because of the fog .
but I can see you , Jennifer .
she smiles .
she presses closer to him .
darling ?
Yes , Wally ?
you &apos;re guessing about those mileposts , aren &apos;t you ?
no , I can see them .
I have rather unusual eyes .
if we &apos;re really over the state line , I can relax .
Wally , what color would those feathers be ?
&quot; feathers &quot; ?
Oh , I don &apos;t know .
but the tar would be black .
let &apos;s stop , Wally .
I guess we &apos;ll have to .
I can &apos;t even see the front of the car .
mighty nice scenery they have around here .
- Lovely , isn &apos;t it ?
- We &apos;d better walk to the next town .
no , I thought we &apos;d stay here .
here ?
we &apos;re in the middle of nowhere .
how do you know , Mr. Wooley ?
good evening .
if you &apos;re looking for a place to stay , I have a lovely room .
thank you .
- Do you have two rooms ?
- No , I &apos;m sorry .
aren &apos;t you married ?
you &apos;re dressed for a wedding .
where &apos;s the nearest justice of the peace ?
he &apos;ll be down in a minute .
Henry ?
customers .
uh , let &apos;s see .
one dollar for waking up the county clerk and helping you get your license .
two dollars for the ceremony .
One-fifty for lodgings .
rent of my pajamas , 25 cents .
rent of nightgown ...
I &apos;ll have to charge you 50 cents for that .
- It &apos;s sort of an heirloom .
- Yeah .
there .
almost a perfect fit .
my grandmother was just a little bit of a thing like you .
Oh , shall I light the fire ?
Oh , no .
I &apos;d like to try .
I must start learning to be a good housewife .
let &apos;s see .
you ... just go like that , don &apos;t you ?
of course .
they &apos;re like any other matches .
well , good night , my dear .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;re going to be very happy .
he &apos;s a fine young man ... and I hope your boys take after him .
and I hope your girls take after you .
by Rhadamanthus , on , fire !
- Wally ?
- Yes , dear ?
- Did you see the way that fire came on ?
- What fire ?
all I can see in this room is you .
- Darling ?
- Mm-hmm ?
- Do you want to have children ?
- Why , of course .
I &apos;d like three little girls exactly like you .
- Ohh !
- Huh ?
I think I &apos;d better tell you .
you &apos;d never forgive me if you found out later .
- Aha !
a confession !
- Yes , Wally .
I haven &apos;t exactly been a saint myself .
we &apos;ll compare notes in the morning .
no , I must tell you now .
I don &apos;t know how to begin .
then don &apos;t .
- Wally ?
- Hmm ?
doesn &apos;t it seem strange to you , the way we met ?
it &apos;s all been like a dream .
- It was witchcraft .
- That &apos;s it .
of course .
- You see , Wally ...
- Shh , dear .
it &apos;s getting late .
but I want you to know what I am .
all right .
all right , what are you ?
I &apos;m a witch .
a witch ?
I knew it all the time .
- You did ?
- Of course .
I &apos;ve been under your spell since the moment I met you .
then ... it doesn &apos;t matter ?
you don &apos;t mind being married to a witch ?
I love it .
I &apos;ll try so hard to be a good wife , and I &apos;ll only use witchcraft to help you .
what could you do , for instance ?
I could make you win the election tomorrow .
Oh , it would take witchcraft to do that .
- I think I can manage it .
- Fine , fine .
after all , I &apos;m not just an ordinary witch .
my family dates back to the days of Pompeii .
- Were you mixed up in that ?
- My father was .
ever hear of the decline and fall of the Roman Empire ?
that was our crowd .
you &apos;re marvelous .
seriously , dear ... do you like to sleep on the left or the right ?
you don &apos;t believe me .
Wally , try to understand .
270 years ago ...
that &apos;s too long a story , dear .
can &apos;t it keep till tomorrow ?
Wally , 270 years ago ...
- You &apos;re not listening to me .
- Yes , dear .
Yes , I am .
270 years ago ...
I &apos;ll tell you tomorrow .
let me out !
let me out !
Oh , why can &apos;t I remember ... the formula for dissolving iron ?
- Let me out !
- Quiet !
- Pipe down !
- I couldn &apos;t get any shut-eye all night .
- Ah , throw him into solitary !
- Yeah .
that &apos;s Wallace Wooley .
don &apos;t tell me they &apos;re tossing him in the clink .
it looks that way .
pay up , brother .
they ain &apos;t electing no con for governor .
Bensinger &apos;s a cinch .
why couldn &apos;t you keep straight until after you was elected , like everybody else does ?
I &apos;d like to talk to you about Jennifer .
we were married last night .
Yes , I know .
congratulations , Master Wooley .
thank you .
she &apos;s been saying the oddest things ... last night and again this morning .
what ?
silly things ... about living in Roxford 270 years ago , and , uh ... and being a witch .
Beelzebub !
don &apos;t you think I know ?
Oh , then she &apos;s acted that way before ?
well , maybe I can help her .
silence !
I must concentrate .
iron , iron , melt away ...
Oh !
I can &apos;t remember a thing .
what is the matter with me ?
I &apos;m afraid you &apos;ve got a hangover .
don &apos;t tell me what I &apos;ve got !
I invented the hangover !
it was in 1892 BC .
did you believe her ?
that &apos;s the important thing .
&quot; believe her &quot; ?
why , the things she said didn &apos;t make any sense .
then there &apos;s still hope .
at first I thought she was joking , but she keeps talking about the election ... saying she &apos;ll make me win by witchcraft ... and that that &apos;ll prove she &apos;s a witch .
master Wooley , see if you can get me out of here .
I know how to handle her .
thanks .
I &apos;ll do my best ... but I &apos;m afraid I haven &apos;t much influence in this town anymore .
- It &apos;ll be a Bensinger landslide !
- Quiet !
three cheers for Wallace Wooley !
Hurray !
Hurray !
Hurray !
- We want Wooley !
- We want Wooley !
- We want Wooley !
we want Wooley !
- Quiet !
we want Wooley !
Hey , hey .
I thought you wanted Bensinger .
- I changed my mind .
- Yeah , but you &apos;re bettin &apos; on Bensinger .
all right , so I &apos;ll lose .
- We want Wooley !
- We want Wooley !
quiet !
quiet !
we want Wooley !
Wallace Wooley is a fraud !
an impostor !
a hypocritical demagogue !
that &apos;s why I &apos;m asking you to vote for ...
Wallace Wooley .
- Mr. Masterson ...
- One moment , please .
Yes ?
you said , &quot; Vote for Wooley . &quot;
did I ?
correction , ladies and gentlemen .
the man I am backing is Bensinger .
W-O-O-L-E-Y !
we want Wooley !
we want Wooley !
we want Wooley !
we want Wooley !
we want Wooley !
we want Wooley .
- We want Wooley !
- We want Wooley !
we want Wooley !
we want Wooley !
we want Wooley !
that includes every precinct in Kearsarge County , folks .
it looks as if the whole state &apos;s gonna make it a Wooley landslide .
more in a minute .
- I can &apos;t believe it .
- That &apos;s just what she &apos;d said she &apos;d do .
- There &apos;s no other explanation .
- You mean she &apos;s a ...
you see why I couldn &apos;t go down to campaign headquarters tonight ?
- If this gets out ...
- Let &apos;s look at these Wappasocket figures .
they &apos;re not complete .
you can &apos;t be carrying Wappasocket County .
that &apos;s Bensinger &apos;s home .
another bulletin , folks :
complete returns from Wappasocket ... show the entire county has climbed on the Wooley bandwagon .
- Well ?
are you convinced ?
- He must mean another county .
hold everything .
here &apos;s a flash , folks .
at 10 : 45 tonight , with only three precincts yet to be heard from ... election returns were as follows :
Wallace Wooley ... 2,684,922 .
Elwood Bensinger ... none .
he didn &apos;t even vote for himself .
Dudley , I &apos;ve married a witch .
what am I going to do ?
let me look at you .
did you say she &apos;s 800,000 years old ?
no , no , no , no , no .
that &apos;s her father .
she &apos;s only 290 .
- I see .
- But you &apos;d never think it .
well , marriage does a lot for people .
well , Wally , this clears everything up .
all except one little point :
how did she get out of the hospital that night ?
- She used a broom .
- Oh , of course !
I must be getting stupid .
a child would know that .
Dudley , what ... what am I going to do ?
- How many people have you told ?
- No one but you .
how can I tell anybody ?
I see your point .
people are so skeptical .
might be hard to grasp that the first lady is a witch .
- I don &apos;t care about them .
what about me ?
- Look out !
are you satisfied , darling ?
you &apos;re the new governor .
- What are you going to do now ?
- Help you with your slippers .
- No , not just yet .
- Then I &apos;ll warm them by the fire .
you know , I lighted it with a match , Wally .
from now on , I &apos;m going to be just a simple , helpful wife .
Dudley , I can &apos;t take it . &quot; a helpful wife . &quot; what if she runs me for president ?
we want Wooley !
what &apos;s that ?
people gathering in the street .
they want you to make a speech .
- Real people ?
- Naturally .
they all voted for Wally .
- What am I gonna say to them ?
- I don &apos;t know .
there are one or two things I wouldn &apos;t tell them .
good night .
- Where are you going ?
- I &apos;ve gotta be getting home ... into my straightjacket !
- Would you like me to drive you ?
- No , thanks .
I &apos;ll call a broom ...
I mean , a taxi .
- Wally , darling .
- Yes , dear ?
you don &apos;t mind my being a witch , do you ?
well , you &apos;ll admit it &apos;s a little unusual .
- No one need ever know .
- We &apos;ll talk about that later , dear .
it &apos;ll be our little secret .
our little secret ?
now go out and make your speech to them , dear .
good evening , my dear .
three cheers for Wallace Wooley !
Hurray !
I must compliment you on the public confidence ... you have inspired for Master Wooley .
- You &apos;re not going to hurt him again ?
- I will attend to him later .
I am concerned now with an erring daughter .
I &apos;ve done nothing except love him .
you have informed him that you are a witch .
need I remind you of the punishment that I must perforce administer ?
at midnight , back to the tree !
there to stay until the present race of men is extinguished .
a rather light sentence , considering the offense .
but if I don &apos;t wish to go ...
- There is nothing you can do about it .
- I &apos;m still a witch .
no , my dear .
your heart is so full of human love ... that I can no longer trust you .
until you have resumed a more spirit-like existence ... you shall be a mere mortal !
I &apos;ve remembered all the spells you &apos;ve taught me .
out , fire , by Rhadamanthus !
out !
you see ?
your power is dead .
mine remains .
out , fire .
better get ready .
soonest done , soonest mended ... and midnight approaches .
may I ... say good-bye ?
certainly , my dear .
I &apos;ll be around .
... endeavor to give this fair state an honest administration .
as a former governor so aptly put it ...
Wally !
Wally !
uh , and in conclusion , thank you very much .
what is it ?
- You must help me !
- You want me to help you ?
- Come on , darling .
hurry !
- No , no .
but where ?
anywhere .
out the back door .
hurry up .
anyplace , Joe .
just drive around .
Hey !
that &apos;s my cab !
- What is all this ?
- I had to get you away .
something might have happened to you .
- What ?
- I don &apos;t know , but something awful .
- Can &apos;t you tell me about it now ?
- Wally , I &apos;m afraid !
you are afraid .
what trouble can you be in that you can &apos;t get out of by witchcraft ?
- I &apos;ve lost my power .
- What ?
I &apos;m not a witch any longer .
I &apos;m like any other girl .
I wish we could go so fast that no power on earth could overtake us !
- Faster !
- Nothing &apos;s going to happen to you while I &apos;m around .
you are like any other girl ... afraid of lightning .
that isn &apos;t ordinary lightning .
- Can &apos;t he go any faster ?
- Step on it , Joe .
faster .
nobody could possibly catch us .
Joe &apos;s a wonderful driver .
there &apos;s nothing he can &apos;t do with the car .
they &apos;ve certainly improved this road .
is it midnight yet ?
no .
five minutes to 12 : 00 .
don &apos;t look !
back to the tree !
don &apos;t worry about me , Master Wooley .
I am accustomed to fire .
come , Jennifer .
I have decided to return with thee to the tree .
I am weary of mortals .
there &apos;s no use fighting .
it has to be like this .
- Jennifer , what are you saying ?
- Go , Wally .
midnight .
Good-bye , my darling .
I want you to remember me as I was :
just an ordinary girl .
he &apos;ll remember .
that will be his torture .
and I &apos;ll remember that I loved you .
through all eternity I &apos;ll remember .
thou wilt remember nothing of this tender feeling .
that will be the essence of thy punishment .
I &apos;ll never forget .
with all my strength I &apos;ll fight .
love is stronger than witchcraft .
I &apos;ll remember everything ... the sound of your voice ... your worried looks ... the warmth of your arms around me ... the touch of your lips .
Good-bye , Wally .
Good-bye , my darling .
I &apos;ll remember .
I &apos;ll always remember .
always .
always .
always .
look at him .
is it not good to see him suffer ?
Yes , Father .
is this not a perfect revenge on the Wooleys ?
Yes , Father .
could we follow him ?
and why ?
to watch him suffer , of course .
well said , Jennifer !
thou art a witch again !
she &apos;s dead , Master Wooley .
thy marriage is a mournful memory .
let &apos;s be gone , Jennifer .
let me tarry but a moment at this window .
I wish to see it all .
thou art enjoying it , eh ?
Oh , yes .
and thou ?
I cannot remember when I &apos;ve had a better time .
it &apos;s great in here .
I &apos;ve called a doctor , Mr. Wooley .
Jennifer ?
the sound of his voice ... it no longer thrills thee ?
- No , Father .
- Good .
and his worried looks ?
and the warmth of his arms around thee ?
these are things that have no meaning for me now .
and the touch of his lips ?
Wally ... love is stronger than witchcraft .
# For tonight I &apos;ll merry , merry be #
# For tonight I &apos;ll merry , merry be #
- # Tomorrow I &apos;ll be sober #
- Oh , no , you won &apos;t .
Wally , darling , all our troubles are over .
at least for the present .
Mr. Wooley ...
I &apos;ve been with your family for 37 years , but this is the end .
- What is it , Margaret ?
- I simply cannot handle your daughter !
Jennifer !
I told you never to play with that broom .
why ?
I &apos;m afraid we &apos;re going to have trouble with her someday .
Oh , that &apos;s impossible .
I hope .
# Good night , ladies #
# We &apos;re going to leave you now #
- In case we miss the train , we have the place in Yonkers . - Of course .
- What &apos;d he say ?
- He said &quot; Of course . &quot;
- We &apos;re from Texas originally . - Of course .
- What &apos;d he say ?
- He said &quot; Of course . &quot;
- Why does he keep sayin &apos; the same thing all the time ?
- My husband &apos;s a little deaf .
- Of course . Yes . - What &apos;d he say ?
he said it &apos;s as quiet as a tomb here – just what we &apos;re lookin &apos; for .
- I don &apos;t mind a little life . we &apos;ll be dead soon enough . - Come in .
concrete .
- I said , &quot; Come in . &quot; - I &apos;m fine , thanks . how are you ?
I hope all the tenants aren &apos;t as disagreeable .
I can assure you they &apos;re not . the building is very friendly , efficient and quiet .
♪ ♪ She got in by mistake , but she &apos;s leaving in the morning .
- What ?
- I said she &apos;s leaving first thing in the morning .
who ? my wife ?
you going home to see your mother ?
what &apos;s that ?
canary ?
I love birds .
I said she is leaving the first thing in the morning .
you don &apos;t have to shout . and your best friend oughta tell you a little secret .
just speak in a low , clear voice .
I said she &apos;s leaving first thing in the morning . she got in by mistake .
but tomorrow she flies away .
I understand it &apos;s a bird .
what about it ?
it &apos;s right here .
- Duplex . - What &apos;s the ceiling so high up for ?
that &apos;s what duplex means . the one floor up over the –
- You don &apos;t keep the apartment very clean . - What &apos;s on the balcony ?
you see , the former tenants aren &apos;t getting the service .
a little delinquency in the rent .
what &apos;s he say ?
I don &apos;t like him to talk to me .
he says the former tenants haven &apos;t been getting any service .
that &apos;s why the place is so dirty . they didn &apos;t pay the rent .
I don &apos;t mind a little dirt .
that &apos;s the trouble with women – always fussing &apos; around , lookin &apos; for something to pick on .
- You can tell me later , Arthur . - Never satisfied with things the way the Lord made &apos; em .
why , dirt &apos;s as natural in this world as sin , disease ... storms , twisters , floods and cyclones .
is there anything else you &apos;d like to try ?
what you doin &apos; in the bathtub with your wrapper on ?
I might ask you what you &apos;re doing in my bathroom .
I don &apos;t suppose you go with the flat .
- Nah . that &apos;s too much to hope for . - Thank you .
- I &apos;m glad you like my perfume too .
I said I &apos;m glad you like my perfume too .
you have a lovely , clear voice – like a bell .
if I was married to you , I &apos;d hear everything you said almost ... but you wouldn &apos;t enjoy it .
- Besides , I &apos;m already married . - So am I .
me too .
anyway , I &apos;d be too old for ya .
&quot; cold are the hands of time that creep along relentlessly ... destroying slowly but without pity that which yesterday was young .
alone , our memories resist this disintegration ... and grow more lovely with the passing years . &quot;
heh . that &apos;s hard to say with false teeth .
you &apos;re a funny old man .
I didn &apos;t get it , but you looked very pretty when you said it .
- I love birds . - You do ?
if they &apos;re showing the apartment and you &apos;re still in it , you must be broke , huh ?
- Ah , it doesn &apos;t matter . - What did you say ?
uh , yes .
- That varmint renting &apos; it out from under ya ?
- Yes . I know how you feel .
I was broke , too , when I was about your age .
but I didn &apos;t have a figure like you got . I had to use my brains .
you &apos;ll get over it . you &apos;ll get over being young too .
someday you &apos;ll wake up and find everything behind ya . gives ya quite a turn .
makes ya sorry for a few of the things ya didn &apos;t do while ya still could .
- Are you sorry ?
- How much rent do you owe ?
well , that isn &apos;t really your business .
I can &apos;t hear you . you &apos;re mumbling .
I said it isn &apos;t really your business .
I &apos;m in the sausage business . don &apos;t worry about me .
this &apos;ll be a hot one on the wife .
she &apos;s down there poking her snoot in everybody &apos;s business ... egged on by that varmint .
how much do you need ?
- Don &apos;t be silly . - Will 500 cover it ?
please don &apos;t talk nonsense .
I can &apos;t hear you . you &apos;re mumbling again .
you shouldn &apos;t mumble with such a lovely voice .
I wouldn &apos;t do this for everybody .
- This joke has gone far enough . - You say that ain &apos;t enough ?
well , how much do you need ?
Y-You &apos;re just embarrassing me .
that &apos;s all right . don &apos;t mention it .
it &apos;s a privilege to do a favor for such a beautiful lady .
it makes me feel young again .
- There . - Oh . how do you suppose it makes me feel ?
I haven &apos;t seen anything like this for so long .
you talkin &apos; about the money ?
forget it . I &apos;m cheesy with money .
I &apos;m the Wienie King – invented the Texas Wienie .
lay off of &apos; em . you &apos;ll live longer . here .
buy yourself a new dress , too , and a new hat .
you &apos;re a fine girl . so long .
whoopee ! hot diggity !
Hello ? give me Longacre 5-6599 , please .
you see , it &apos;s strong and safe . it &apos;s simple and practical .
it lets the light and air through , and it &apos;s practically invisible from below .
and it &apos;s built right in the middle of the city ... instead of way out in the sticks somewhere .
excuse me a moment . be right back .
- Yes ? - Darling , the most exciting thing has happened .
look , honey , I &apos;m right in the middle of a talk with a very important gentleman .
- Could you tell me later ?
- Oh , all right , dear .
of course , this is the big one ... but to build a working model in some field or village somewhere ... that small planes could actually land on – to prove that it was practical – would only cost about $ 99,000 .
after that , we &apos;d be on velvet .
you see , it &apos;s a steel mesh made of stretched cables .
every municipality , every town , every city needs one .
- My patent is basic . - $ 99,000 is a lot of money .
Oh , but it isn &apos;t what it costs . it &apos;s what it brings you back .
I &apos;ve got $ 99,000 now ... but if I was to build this thing , I might –
let &apos;s start all over again from the beginning .
go ahead . my time ain &apos;t worth anything . I &apos;m retired .
Hey , Mike , come here a minute .
take a gander inside and see if the manager &apos;s gone to dinner .
- I don &apos;t wanna see him face-to-face .
- Sure .
but if it &apos;s the rent you &apos;re thinking about ... you can go in and whistle up his nose – it &apos;s paid .
- It &apos;s paid ?
what do you mean it &apos;s paid ?
- It &apos;s paid .
- Who paid it ?
- Your wife .
- My wife ?
- Well , I &apos;m sure it wasn &apos;t mine .
- An old man give her the money . - What do you mean an old man gave her the money ?
I said I &apos;m taking you to dinner and then the theater and then supper .
so hurry up and put on your dinner jacket .
just a minute .
what &apos;s all this malarkey about some old man paying the rent for you ... that the whole building is buzzing with ?
it &apos;s not malarkey , darling . here &apos;s the receipted bill . you see ?
it says &quot; Paid . &quot; and I paid the butcher and the grocer and the drugstore .
and I got this dress and had my hair done ... and six pairs of stockings and some new shoes .
and here &apos;s $ 14 in change . that &apos;s for you .
- Isn &apos;t it wonderful ?
- Sensational . but you haven &apos;t quite answered my question yet .
- What question , dear ?
- Why this alleged old man gave you – How much is it ?
- $ 700 . - $ 700 .
- Why ?
- No reason .
- Oh , is that so ? he just – $ 700 , just like that ?
- Just like that .
sex didn &apos;t even enter into it ?
Oh , but of course it did , darling .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;d have given it to me if I had hair like excelsior ... and little short legs like an alligator .
- Sex always has something to do with it , dear .
- I see .
from the time you &apos;re about so big ... and wondering why your girlfriends &apos; fathers are getting so arch all of a sudden .
nothing wrong . just an overture to the opera that &apos;s coming .
- I see . - You don &apos;t really .
but from then on , you get it from cops , taxi drivers ... bellboys , delicatessen dealers .
- Got what ?
- The look . you know .
&quot; how &apos;s about this evening , babe ? &quot;
- So this gent gave you the look . - The Wienie King ?
Oh , no .
Oh , at his age , darling , it was really more of a blink .
really ?
this is very illuminating .
you don &apos;t have to get rigid about it .
it was perfectly innocent , I assure you .
where &apos;d you meet this Wienie King ?
- You &apos;ll die laughing when you hear . - All right . Convulse me .
- In the bathtub . - In the bathtub ?
- Yes . isn &apos;t that charming ?
- Delicious . what were you doing in the bathtub ?
- I was hiding from him . - Hiding ?
what kind of games do you play around here while I &apos;m out ?
- I wish you could &apos;ve seen the expression on his face . - I &apos;m glad I didn &apos;t .
- How much water was there in the tub ?
- I was standing in the bathtub .
- You were standing in the bathtub ?
- In my pink wrapper .
Oh , darling , he was just a funny little old man in a funny hat .
- We sat on the edge of the bed and talked for a while . - He &apos;s on the bed now , is he ?
there aren &apos;t any chairs in the bedroom , darling .
what was he doing in the bedroom ?
he wanted to rent the apartment .
but when he found out we were broke , he gave me $ 700 and he left .
- Just like that ?
- Well , I did kiss him good-bye .
- Now the truth is coming out .
- The – Oh . &quot; the truth . &quot;
you just tell me where this Wienie King lives ... and I &apos;ll take his money back to him and tell him what I think of him .
I don &apos;t know where he lives , darling .
I don &apos;t even know his name , and I don &apos;t think they &apos;d give the money back –
I mean the grocer and the drugstore and all .
- You really couldn &apos;t blame them after they waited so long . - That &apos;s right .
rub it in .
- Tom ?
- Yes ?
it &apos;s wonderful to have the rent paid , isn &apos;t it , and the bills settled up ?
you feel free and clean , and I like that feeling . I wish it were always like that .
don &apos;t you think I do ?
I &apos;d almost forgotten what it was like .
I don &apos;t look forward to being in debt again , slinking past everybody .
- I dread it . - It isn &apos;t gonna be for always .
everybody &apos;s a flop until he &apos;s a success .
something &apos;s bound to come through . I got too many good ideas .
say , there &apos;s a $ 2.00 overcharge here .
now that everything &apos;s paid up , you could move .
well , where &apos;d we go ?
I wasn &apos;t thinking about me . I just meant you .
Oh . you mean the bust-up ?
Mm-hmm . when &apos;d you get that idea ?
this afternoon ?
I &apos;ve had it for some time , but something always said , &quot; Wait till he crashes through .
wait till he &apos;s made one success . &quot;
you &apos;ll never make a success with me around .
- I &apos;m just a milestone around your neck . - Millstone .
I &apos;m no good for you , darling .
I don &apos;t mean I &apos;m not good for somebody ... but I can &apos;t cook or sew or whip up a little dress ... out of last year &apos;s window curtains .
what difference does that make ?
I &apos;m like a car that only gives seven miles to the tankful .
only you haven &apos;t got the tankful .
are you sure you haven &apos;t got a tankful ?
you see , by yourself , you could live so simply . just a little room anywhere .
or maybe move in with your brother or even use the couch in your office .
and you wouldn &apos;t keep slipping back all the time .
you could balance what you earned and look the world in the eye ... maybe even get ahead a little .
- Thanks . and what would you be doing ?
- Oh , that &apos;s no problem .
you can always find a good provider if you really want one .
he may not look like a movie star , but –
- We &apos;ll get ahead someday . - But I don &apos;t want it someday .
I want it now while I can still enjoy it .
anyway , men don &apos;t get smarter as they grow older . they just lose their hair .
- Gerry – - But I would !
I &apos;m very tired of being broke , darling ... and feeling so helpless about having my hands tied .
I could &apos;ve helped you so many times .
but every time I tried to , you tried to punch the man in the nose .
don &apos;t talk rot .
- How about that president of the smelting company ?
- That wolf . well , he &apos;s still the president of a smelting company .
we might &apos;ve been in the smelting business now and paying our rent .
- Lovely . - He liked you very much , he said .
the less I hear about that hyena , the better I like it .
but that &apos;s what &apos;s so irritating – to know that I could get you someplace without doing any harm either .
you have no idea what a long-legged gal can do without doing anything .
and instead of that , I have to watch you stamping around proudly ... like Sitting Bull in a new blanket ... breathing through your nose while we both starve to death .
- Thanks . - You don &apos;t have to keep saying thanks all the time .
- I &apos;m not being nice . - That &apos;s the first time I &apos;ve said it .
if you want a divorce , you &apos;re certainly entitled to it .
I don &apos;t know where the money &apos;s coming from .
the next husband always pays for that .
- You have him all picked out , have you ?
- Oh , you &apos;re such a child !
he doesn &apos;t happen to be in the sausage business , by any chance , does he ?
I may not even get married again . I might become an adventuress .
I can just see you starting for China on a 26-foot sailboat .
you &apos;re thinking of an adventurer , dear .
an adventuress never goes on anything under 300 feet with a crew of 80 .
you just let me catch you on a 300-foot yacht or even a 200-foot yacht .
at least I wouldn &apos;t have to worry about the rent .
Oh , I &apos;m sorry . let &apos;s go and have some dinner , hmm ?
how can you think of food at a moment like this ?
because I &apos;m a woman , maybe , and a little more practical than you .
are you going to put on your dinner jacket , or shall I take off my new dress ?
Mmm . is that a new dress ?
- You &apos;ll always be a sister to me ?
- I know it sounds stupid , but I &apos;m a rotten wife .
- I can &apos;t sew . I can &apos;t cook . - You certainly can &apos;t .
just because I &apos;m a useless wife doesn &apos;t mean I couldn &apos;t be very valuable to you as a sister .
but very valuable .
I remember that pot roast you tried .
and all the boys who wanted to go out with me ...
- would naturally have to be in your good graces . - Naturally .
- Or I wouldn &apos;t go out with them . - I &apos;ll say you wouldn &apos;t .
- They &apos;d probably offer you partnerships . - In the smelting business .
in the smelt – No .
you could have your choice .
I don &apos;t begin and end with a smelter , you know .
I refuse to understand what you &apos;re talking about , Geraldine .
they &apos;d work you in on deals ... and let you in on all the good things happening in the market and that kind of business .
monkey business .
very few pretty girls &apos; brothers have ever failed , you know ... if they knew enough to come in out of a hailstorm .
in the first place , I don &apos;t happen to be your brother .
in the second place , who are all these men who are gonna faint at your feet ?
- You think there aren &apos;t any ?
- I didn &apos;t say there weren &apos;t any . I just said , &quot; Where are they ? &quot;
they &apos;re around . they &apos;re always there .
and they make new ones every year .
- I don &apos;t wanna be rude , but I – - You &apos;re not being rude , dear . you &apos;re just being yourself .
you &apos;re married to me . that &apos;s like saying you &apos;re blind to me .
for a long time , I &apos;ve been a part of you ... just something to snuggle up to and keep you warm at night , like a blanket .
but you can &apos;t see me any more than you can see the back of your neck .
I &apos;ve put on new dresses . I changed my hair .
would you mind not looking quite so gorgeous while you say all these things ?
- You &apos;re just plastered . - Yes .
well , better get you home before you fall apart .
or do you object to spending the night under the same roof with me ?
I wasn &apos;t thinking about the roof .
come on .
just a minute . I gotta pay the check .
I &apos;ll sleep on the thing here .
well , you know we don &apos;t love each other anymore . we &apos;re just habits – bad habits .
uh – They don &apos;t make these zippers as well as they used to .
and when love &apos;s gone , there &apos;s nothing left but admiration and respect .
I think it &apos;s stuck . will you see if you can get it ?
come around here in the light .
keep still , will you ?
you don &apos;t think this is a little intimate , do you ?
Oh , go .
doesn &apos;t mean anything to you anymore to sit on my lap , hmm ?
no .
or if I ... kiss you there ?
stop it . no .
or here .
it &apos;s nothing .
- Or here . - You know I &apos;m ticklish .
- Then why is your breath coming faster ?
- Because you &apos;re squeezing me .
that doesn &apos;t mean anything to you anymore , huh ?
almost nothing .
almost nothing – nothing but a habit , a bad habit .
it is , huh ?
very , very bad and wicked ... and stupid and useless ... and young and impractical and –
- Yow ! - Oh ! Oh , darling !
- What &apos;s the big idea ?
- Darling , read this note .
- Huh ? - Good-bye .
God bless you . take care of yourself .
- Will you wait a minute ?
- No , I won &apos;t . I &apos;ve made up my mind .
it &apos;s best for both of us , while we &apos;re still young enough to make other connections .
but you &apos;re forgetting a little thing called love . I love you , and you love me .
that &apos;s all that matters . that &apos;s all you can take with you . everything else is –
I &apos;m so sorry . please accept all my apologies .
Gerry !
Hey , Officer !
hold that woman ! she stole my suitcase !
why , you lying –
you mean this one ?
that &apos;s right . I &apos;ll be right down .
do I look like a suitcase stealer to you ?
it isn &apos;t how you look . it &apos;s how you behave that counts in this world .
- Now , I mind the time , and –
- Oh , wise guy .
thanks for holding her , Officer .
you wanna prepare charges or something disagreeable like that ?
no , I &apos;d prefer not to . this is my wife , Mrs. Jeffers . Mr. Mulligan .
the name happens to be O &apos;Donnell , if it &apos;s all the same to you ... and I have a good mind to charge you with false arrest ... only I don &apos;t know if I could make it stick .
- Why don &apos;t you try ? - Oh , it &apos;s too nice a mornin &apos; . to heck with it .
why don &apos;t you two learn to get along together ? I had to .
- Now what ?
- Now , will you come back upstairs and be sensible ?
no , I won &apos;t . give me back my suitcase .
it was hard enough to make up my mind to do what I know is right .
if I don &apos;t do it now , I &apos;ll never be strong enough again . now give me my suitcase .
stop talking like a fool , Gerry .
where are you going – to visit your sister in Long Island ?
taxi ! no . I &apos;m going to get a divorce .
how can you get a divorce without money ?
how can you go anyplace ?
why don &apos;t you be sensible ?
you &apos;ve just got a hangover .
I don &apos;t need any money . I &apos;ve already told you .
taxi !
- Yes , ma &apos;am ? - Where &apos;s the best place to get a divorce ?
Gerry , for heaven &apos;s sake .

- To where ?
Palm Beach ?
- No , no . just to the station . - Oh , sure .

- Listen what ?
- Give me my suitcase !
give the lady her suitcase .
- Listen , you ! - Oh ! now , look what you &apos;ve done !
- Look what I &apos;ve done ?
- Yeah . look what you &apos;ve done .
Hey ! - What &apos;s the trouble now ?
- Taxi !

Hey , you have to –
Gerry !
Gerry , stop behaving like a chicken with its head cut off .
you haven &apos;t got any money . where can you go ?
- I got this far , didn &apos;t I ?
- But , Gerry –
- Where &apos;s my suitcase ?
- But listen , honey –
Good-bye .
- Gerry , listen to me . you &apos;re making a fool out of yourself . - This man is trying to molest me .
- Will you stop him ?
- Where you goin &apos; in such a hurry , laddie ?

Pennsylvania Station will leave you alone and vice versa .

- Who are you ?
- I &apos;m fine , thanks . how are you ?
you must be her husband . where is she ?
- What &apos;s that your business ?
- I &apos;m in the sausage business .
just wanted to tell her we moved in after all .
took the green apartment down the hall that the opera singer moved out of .
she &apos;s gone .
I say she &apos;s gone ! she &apos;s gone to Florida ! she &apos;s going to divorce me !
- You say she &apos;s gone ?
- That &apos;s right .
good for her . a pretty girl like that can get anybody .
why hang around with a man that can &apos;t pay the rent ?
look here , you &apos;ve made trouble enough around here without getting insulting about it !
don &apos;t threaten me ! I &apos;m twice your age and only half as big ...
- but I &apos;m mighty handy with a shillelagh – - All right , I &apos;m sorry .
I &apos;m sorry . I guess you didn &apos;t mean any harm !
you &apos;re probably very kind at that .
- You say she &apos;s gone and left you ?
- That &apos;s right .
- How did she go ? by train ?
- That &apos;s right .
that &apos;s right !
why don &apos;t you fly down there in an aerioplane with a bunch of roses in your hand ... and meet her when she gets off and bring her home ?
- Because I &apos;m not in the sausage business ! - So am I .
and it &apos;s a good business if you know where to get the meat cheap .
that &apos;s my secret , and I ain &apos;t telling &apos; no one .
- Have you got money for an aerioplane ticket ?
- No !
why don &apos;t you say so instead of standing &apos; there like a big stinkweed !

♪ A-hunting we will go ♪ Hey ! what &apos;s goin &apos; on here ?
- No , ma &apos;am . - What do you mean my clothes aren &apos;t there ?
they &apos;re in stateroom &quot; B , &quot; in the private car behind the diner – the club car –
- with my ticket , my handbag , my lipstick and everything . - No , ma &apos;am .
- &quot; No , ma &apos;am . &quot; you just didn &apos;t look . - Oh , yes , ma &apos;am , I looked .
but I didn &apos;t see it &apos; cause it weren &apos;t there . that &apos;s why I didn &apos;t see it .
- I suppose it just blew up . - No , ma &apos;am . we set it out .
- You set it out ?
the conductor kinda got riled up with &apos; em ... so he set it out on a siding at Rockingham Hamlet for &apos; em to cool off .
- A very pretty little city . - Never mind the geography . where &apos;s the conductor ?
- He got off at Rawley . that &apos;s where he lives . - Last call for breakfast .
- Dining car in the rear . - Very pretty countryside there .
- You don &apos;t seem to understand . my clothes are lost . - Last call for breakfast .
- Shut up . - Yes , ma &apos;am .
no , ma &apos;am . they ain &apos;t lost . nothin &apos; ever gets lost on a Pullman .
they safe , all right . I recollect one time a lady left a whole pile –
- I just want to get into my clothes . - You can &apos;t do that .
- What do I go around in – a blanket like an Indian ?
- I got a brown overcoat .
- Well , that &apos;s very kind of you . - Hello .
- Hello . - What are you doing for breakfast ?
well , if you don &apos;t ask me , I won &apos;t be doing much .
and if you do ask me , it might make quite a scandal .
- Huh ? - Lady lose her clothes .
you lost your clothes ?
why , that &apos;s terrible .
and my ticket and my bag and my shoes and my makeup .
my toothbrush – only I don &apos;t think I had one .
this is disgraceful . I &apos;ll certainly write to the president of the company .
- How could such a thing happen ?
- I don &apos;t know .
my things seem to have gotten into a car back there somewhere somehow ... and now the car just doesn &apos;t seem to be there .
not that car full of drunks , I hope , that they had to disconnect .
Oh , perish the thought .
as soon as we come to a town , I could jump over to a store and jump back .
with a Mother Hubbard . well , that &apos;s very kind of you .
in the meantime , I suppose I &apos;ll have to lie here in this hat rack .
anyway , I haven &apos;t any money for you to jump over to a store and back with .
- Oh , I have money . - Oh , you have ?
Oh , yes . now , if you could just get over to the store to pick out what you need –
we got a stretcher in the baggage car up ahead .
wouldn &apos;t that be stretching it a little ?
wait a minute .
maybe we could borrow some odd pieces here and there among the lady passengers .
- Oh , murder . - That &apos;s a wonderful idea .
- You take that side , and I &apos;ll take this side . - Yes , sir .
and I &apos;ll take the neck .
here , we &apos;ve got some more . or are you satisfied ?
satisfied ?
I could lend you my earrings .
- Good morning . - Good morning .
Oh ! why , that &apos;s lovely . now you won &apos;t need anything else .
that &apos;s what you think .
Yes , ma &apos;am .
if there &apos;s one thing I admire ... it &apos;s a woman who can whip up something out of nothing .
- You should taste my popovers . - I &apos;d love to .
the homely virtues are so hard to find these days – a woman who can sew and cook and bake , even if she doesn &apos;t have to .
- And knit and – - And weave .
you &apos;re joking , but I mean , seriously , that is a woman .
were you going to buy me some breakfast ... or would you like me to bake you something here at the table ?
I like a witty woman too . now , what will you have ?
the 35-cent breakfast seems the best at first glance ... but if you analyze it for solid value , the 55-center is the one .
- I wouldn &apos;t want to impose . - No . feel free to choose anything you like .
there &apos;s even a 75-cent breakfast if it appeals to you .
- We might share one . - Wait a minute .
with two eggs , toast and choice of fruit thrown in ...
I &apos;m not sure the 75-cent breakfast isn &apos;t the best value after all .
- Do we dare ?
- I &apos;m not really the way you think I am .
it &apos;s just my upbringing . Oh , waiter .
- Yes , sir . - Two 75-cent breakfasts , please .
- I &apos;ll start with a prairie oyster . - Yes , ma &apos;am .
it &apos;s a very tempting choice in the $ 1.10 breakfast .
two 75-cent breakfasts .
I &apos;ll start with a prairie oyster , also , whatever it is .
- Make mine on the half shell . - Yes , sir .
- Prairie oysters is à la carte . - All right , all right .
they always get the best of you somehow .
- Now , you say you have no ticket ?
- That &apos;s right .
naturally , I can &apos;t buy you a ticket – a perfectly strange young woman .
- Naturally . - In the first place , you wouldn &apos;t accept it .
- In the second place – - There &apos;s the expense .
I wasn &apos;t actually thinking of that . now , I get off at Jacksonville .
I guess I do , too , unless they throw me off sooner .
suppose we go to a store in Jacksonville and buy you the few little things you need ... and then you come the rest of the way with me by boat ?
you won &apos;t have had to accept a ticket from somebody you don &apos;t know ... but you &apos;ll still get to where you &apos;re going .
- How &apos;s that ?
- I don &apos;t have to row , do I ?
two prairie oysters .
Oh , very nice . let &apos;s have that one too .
- How much is it ?
- That is 212.50 , monsieur .
- We &apos;ll take it . - We &apos;ll take it .
I – I didn &apos;t expect you to buy me all this stuff .
I really don &apos;t think I can accept it .
if you &apos;d just get me a dress and some shoes and a hat .
really more in the nature of a loan .
nonsense .
it &apos;s cheaper in the end to buy good quality ... and enough of them so that you don &apos;t wear them out .
they last longer , they look better ... and there &apos;s a certain pleasure to having a change .
well , that &apos;s awfully kind of you .
are you sure you can afford all this ?
I think so . we haven &apos;t done anything very extravagant yet .
well , I &apos;d hate to have you end up on a chain gang .
- I think we &apos;re still perfectly safe .
- You &apos;re really sure it &apos;s all right ?
- Oh , certainly .
- You &apos;re not a burglar or something ?
- Oh , no . that was my grandfather .
at least , that &apos;s what they called him .
Oh . Yes .
do you like this one ?
Oh , it &apos;s lovely .
but aren &apos;t the sleeves a little short ?
Oh , that is for the bracelet , monsieur .
that is what we call the bracelet length .
Oh . would you like a bracelet ?
what kind of a bracelet do you mean ?
- Any kind you like . - You mean with stones ?
certainly with stones !
they are all the rage .
why not ?
what kind of stones do you like ?
- Well –
- Red !
- That is all the rage . - You mean like garnets ?
don &apos;t you think garnets are a little lifeless ?
Oh .
why , certainly .
this is great fun .
I &apos;ve never bought things for a girl before – I mean , in any such quantities .
you &apos;ve been denying yourself , monsieur ... one of the basic pleasures in life .
I guess I have .
- All right . - Plus tax .
Yes , it &apos;s these taxes that get you down .
I keep feeling that two men with butterfly nets ... are going to creep up behind you and lead you away .
you &apos;re thinking of my uncle . I &apos;m not the crazy one in the family .
- I &apos;m perfectly normal . - Why do you travel around in a lower berth ?
I find it a little stuffy in an upper .
- Oh , you mean why don &apos;t I take a stateroom ?
- Yes . Staterooms are un-American .
- Well , thank you . - Don &apos;t mention it .
now , if you can &apos;t think of anything else , we &apos;d better get started .
just charge everything , please , and have it put in the taxi . good day .
- Excuse me . - Oh , I &apos;m so sorry . forgive me .
I &apos;m so used to buying in stores where I &apos;m known that it totally slipped my mind .
- Mr. Ha-Ha-Ha –
- That &apos;s all right .
don &apos;t mention it .
- Excuse me , please . I didn &apos;t – - Good day .
well , what are you standing there for ?
where are the packages ?
how about some service !
why do I got to do everything myself ?
is this yours ?
Oh , yes . actually , it was my grandfather &apos;s , but he didn &apos;t like it .
he only used it once . this was his hat .
do you happen to remember how much tip I gave the taxi driver ?
well , I didn &apos;t see the coin ... but from his face , I think it was 10 cents .
tipping is un-American .
- What &apos;s your name ?
- Hackensacker .
not John D. Hackensacker ?
Oh , I &apos;m not my grandfather , of course .
he &apos;s dead anyway . I &apos;m John D. , III .
then you &apos;re one of the richest men in the world .
- Yes , I suppose so . - I would step on your face .
that &apos;s quite all right . I rather enjoyed it .
- Twice !
- You made quite an impression .
- May I get you a rug , madam ?
- Oh , no , thank you .
will you dine on deck , Mr. Hackensacker , or in the saloon ?
we can have it on deck , if you like , but it blows everything all over the place .
there are a lot of inconveniences to yachting ... that most people don &apos;t know anything about .
- Give me the peaceful train . - In the saloon , please .
very good , madam .
see what I mean ?
I just happen to own this thing , or I &apos;d never go near it .
- Did you say you were John D. , III or IV ?
- The Third .
the Fourth will be my son , when I marry .
Oh . then it really didn &apos;t mean anything to you ... to buy me all those things , did it ?
I can &apos;t pretend that it was a great sacrifice ... but it did give me a great deal of pleasure .
you like to write in your little book .
it used to please my grandfather .
it &apos;s just a habit . it &apos;s nonsense really .
I write things down , but I never add them up .
- Where are you staying in Palm Beach ?
- Oh , no place yet .
where are you staying ?
- At my sister &apos;s . - Oh , yes , the princess . or is it the duchess ?
- The Princess Centimillia . - Of course .
what are you going to Palm Beach for ?
- A divorce . - Oh .
well , you needn &apos;t look so sour about it .
your sister &apos;s been divorced five times , hasn &apos;t she ?
no , no . three . she was annulled twice .
Oh . well , I &apos;ve never been divorced before .
good . by the way , what is your name ?
Oh , Jeffers . Geraldine Jeffers .
- Was he brutal to you ?
- Huh ? Oh , not particularly .
a drunkard , huh ?
no , not congenital or anything like that .
women always protect the man they &apos;ve been married to .
Yes , I suppose it &apos;s human nature .
did he beat you ?
- Not often . - The hound .
Oh , a man &apos;s a man , I suppose . they &apos;re all tarred with the same brush .
how brave you are . when I marry , there &apos;ll be no divorce .
that &apos;s why I &apos;ve been a little cautious .
- You &apos;re afraid somebody will marry you for your money . - Oh , I expect that .
when money reaches certain proportions ...
- you can &apos;t ignore it any more than you can a-a –
- A horse in a bedroom .
I wasn &apos;t thinking exactly of that , but it &apos;ll serve .
I see marriage as a sort of permanent welding ... a growing together of two trees – in spite of anything my sister can demonstrate to the contrary – into a sort of permanent mess – mass .
like a permanent grafting of two trees into a permanent graft .
Oh , that one &apos;s too easy .
Oh , you mean a permanent graft .
I get it . but it doesn &apos;t have to be .
- It can be very nice , I &apos;m sure . - Oh , it can be .
and after the divorce , you have plans ?
- Oh , yes . - Anybody I know ?
I know almost everybody in Palm Beach .
Oh , no . I haven &apos;t picked him out yet . just some very rich man .
some very rich man ?
Oh , I wasn &apos;t thinking of anyone as rich as you .
- That might get to be annoying . - It is .
is it ?
no , I just meant somebody who &apos;s well fixed ... and who could spare the $ 99,000 without missing it too much .
I &apos;m not quite sure I understand about the $ 99,000 .
well , you see , he just happens to need $ 99,000 .
and , after all , I don &apos;t see any reason why he shouldn &apos;t get it ... if I &apos;m throwing it out the windows .
- This is your last husband you &apos;re talking about ?
- Yes . - He wants to sell you for $ 99,000 ?
- Oh , no .
- I don &apos;t think he had any such idea at all . - What do you call it ?
well , I mean , after all , I – He &apos;s entitled to something .
I mean , he did protect me and give me food , such as it was ... and clothes , such as they were , for a few years .
- And now , if I can repay – - But the man is a vermin . no court of law –
- Don &apos;t you think I &apos;m worth $ 99,000 ?
- That has nothing to do with it .
you &apos;re probably worth that , twice that , three times .
but even so , the days of serfdom – I mean bondage –
I mean , the days you bought a wife for a cow are over . I never heard of such a thing .
chivalry is not only dead , it &apos;s decomposed .
well , how much did this yacht cost you ?
that is entirely beside the point . a woman is not a vessel .
of all the filthy things I &apos;ve heard in my life , I still –
- How does he want it ?
- In cash maybe .
in cash , so I won &apos;t stop the check . the scoundrel .
I don &apos;t mean me . I mean whoever &apos;s –
Oh , well , I don &apos;t think he &apos;ll ever get it . it was just an idea .
there is a name for such reptiles ... but I won &apos;t sully this sweet ocean breeze by mentioning it .
I may not be exactly in the best of shape ... but if ever I meet this Mr. Jeffers ...
I &apos;ll thrash him within an inch of his life .
Oh , then I hope you never meet him .
- I suppose he &apos;s large . - Well , he &apos;s not small .
that &apos;s one of the tragedies of this life – that the men who are most in need of a beating up are always enormous .
she &apos;s a tall , dark-haired girl with big eyes .
Yes , sir . I know who you talkin &apos; about .
- You mean the young lady that lose all her clothes . - Lost all her clothes ?
Yes , sir . but we fix her up with a blanket when she got off at Jacksonville .
- She got off at Jacksonville ?
- Yes , sir .
- Alone ?
- Well , you might practically say she &apos;s alone .
the gentleman that got off with her ... give me 10 cents from New York to Jacksonville .
watch your step , lady . she &apos;s alone , but she don &apos;t know it .
never mind the philosophy . then she &apos;s at Jacksonville !
Yes , sir . no , sir .
Oh , she said that he said ... he was gonna take her down there on his boat .
I suppose she means &quot; yachet . &quot;
but I don &apos;t see how no gentleman can give me a dime ... from New York to Jacksonville can have a yachet .
maybe a canoe or a bicycle . Yes , sir .
- Hey , let me use these a minute , will you ?
- Thanks . - Anytime .
I think you &apos;ll like Palm Beach very much .
Yoo-hoo !
- Who &apos;s that ?
- Oh , that &apos;s my sister , the princess . Hello , Maude .
Hello , Snoodles . where &apos;d you get the pretty girl ?
- Greetings . - She calls me Snoodles .
- Is that the prince ?
- No , the prince is all washed up .
- This is something new . - It might be a duke .
it might be her tailor too . she goes out with anything .
Hello , darling . what a perfectly beautiful day .
were you seasick on the way down ?
wherever did you find her ?
- This is Toto . say &quot; How do you do ? &quot; Toto . - Greetings .
Toto &apos;s a refugee – from his creditors , I think .
Greetings .
- Glad to be aboard , sir . how are you , darling ?
- Hello , Maude .
Hello . glad to see you aboard . you get prettier as one gets nearer .
- Thank you . - How did you manage it ?
he &apos;s stiffer than a plank .
- This must have done him a power of good . - This is my sister . Maude , Mrs. –
don &apos;t tell me he doesn &apos;t even know your name ! this is perfectly marvelous .
tell me he picked you up on the train and you &apos;ll make me a happy woman .
- Greetings . - All right , Toto , you &apos;ve said &quot; How do you do ? &quot;
wait till I tell the papers .
Maude , somebody meeting you for the first time , not knowing you were cracked ...
- might get the wrong impression . - Did he really pick you up on the train ?
I was in awful trouble until he nobly came to my rescue .
now you &apos;ve spoiled everything .
I hoped for once he hadn &apos;t done anything noble ... that he was really cooking with gas .
- What a lovely suit . - He bought me this .
why , Snoodles , you rat .
we &apos;ll work this into something yet .
this is perfectly electrifying . you must come and stay with us , and we &apos;ll warm this up .
- You &apos;re divorced , of course . - No , no . not quite .
that &apos;s marvelous . I don &apos;t think I &apos;m quite through with the prince yet either .
we can look for new husbands together .
I &apos;m thinking of an American at the moment . it seems more patriotic .
- Greetings . - No , no , Toto . his English is a little elementary .
- Nitz . what language does he speak ?
I don &apos;t know . I think it &apos;s Baluchistan , but it &apos;s impossible to tell .
- Hello . - Let &apos;s go ashore .
I &apos;ll put you in the blue suite . we &apos;ll have a wonderful time .
you &apos;re perfectly respectable .
as long as we don &apos;t roll on the floor ... and give the butler hysterics , we &apos;ll be cooking on the front burner .
- I talk a lot , don &apos;t I ?
- Yes .
Ah , Snoodles , you snake in the grass !
did you get him drunk , or how did you do it ?
- You &apos;ll have to tell me all about it later . - Maude .
look at that very handsome man . I wonder who he is .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ve seen him around before .
I thought I knew all the handsome men in this village .
- We could use some new faces . - It isn &apos;t possible .
what isn &apos;t possible ?
I think I know that man . in fact , I &apos;m sure of it .
what did you follow me down here for anyway ?
what do you mean what did I follow you down here for ?
you &apos;re my wife , aren &apos;t you ?
you &apos;re making an ass of yourself , exposing yourself to all sorts of dangers ...
- that I promised to love , honor and protect you from . - But that isn &apos;t fair !
- Will you realize that I &apos;m doing this for you too ?
- I don &apos;t want you to do any more .
but I &apos;ve left you . I &apos;m not your wife any longer .
- You &apos;re not my husband . - Gerry , darling .
- No , no . stop it . - Well , I must say you do know him !
this is the Princess Centimillia .
my brother , Captain Mc – McGlue .
- What ?
- Captain . we should have met sooner .
if I &apos;d seen you around , we would have .
this is my brother , Captain Hackensacker . Captain McGlue – that &apos;s an odd name .
- Yes , isn &apos;t it ?
how do you do , Captain ?
- I &apos;m not a captain .
that &apos;s my sister &apos;s joke because I own a yacht .
that &apos;s my sister &apos;s joke because I don &apos;t own one .
very glad to meet you . your sister didn &apos;t tell me she had a brother here .
- No , I just dropped over . - You &apos;re staying with us , of course .
no , we wouldn &apos;t want to inconvenience you . we &apos;ll go to a hotel .
- Inconvenience us ?
Bumble puppy . - But , Mac –
we practically run a hotel . this will give the servants some exercise .
I won &apos;t take no for an answer . your brother &apos;s a very fine-looking man .
you look exactly alike . I suppose he &apos;s married .
- No , no . he &apos;s entirely free . - You don &apos;t tell me .
- Now , look – - Don &apos;t pay any attention to her , Captain .
- Her bark is worse than her bite . - That &apos;s what you think .
I wish I hadn &apos;t brought Toto along today .
somebody think of an errand to send him on .
- Hello . - Toto , this is Captain McGlue .
I &apos;m going to see more of him and less of you from now on .
- Hello . - Listen carefully , dear . I left my handkerchief –
on the yacht . you go fetch it , see ?
- Nitz . - Yitz , Toto .
- Nitz . - It &apos;ll be nitz to you , Toto .
and now , Captain , you may take my arm .
- Uh – - What did you say you were captain of ?
I didn &apos;t say a word about it .
how wonderful it is meeting a silent American again .
all my husbands were foreigners . and such chatterboxes .
I could hardly get a word in edgeways .
- They make a handsome couple , don &apos;t they ?
- Pardon ? my sister and your brother . it &apos;d be nice if something came of it .
Oh – Oh !
Oh , yes , wouldn &apos;t it ?
it would be wonderful for him .
of course , she &apos;s no bargain , but it might happen very easily .
she &apos;s a woman of iron determination .
once her mind is made up , you might as well yield .
I can see what you mean .
- I &apos;m glad you &apos;re gonna stay with us , and your brother too . - Are you ?
I don &apos;t know why I didn &apos;t think of it , or maybe I did think of it .
but it took someone of my sister &apos;s courage to make it come true .
- You &apos;re very sweet . - Thank you very much .
the captain &apos;s a big fellow , isn &apos;t he ?
- Yes , isn &apos;t he ?
- You look exactly alike .
Yes , don &apos;t we ?
you know , people always remark on it .
why don &apos;t you marry her ?
she &apos;s lovely .
in the first place , she isn &apos;t free yet .
in the second place , you don &apos;t marry somebody you just met the day before .
- At least , I don &apos;t . - But that &apos;s the only way , dear .
if you get to know too much about them , you &apos;d never marry them .
I &apos;d marry Captain McGlue tomorrow .
- Even with that name . - And divorce him next month .
nothing is permanent in this world except Roosevelt , dear .
as a matter of fact , Maude , I &apos;m becoming very attracted to this young woman ...
- more so than anyone I &apos;ve known the same length of time . - Aha .
but I want to know how she is early in the morning , late at night , rain or shine ... under trying circumstances – as when the servants leave in a body –
- how she is with children –
- What are you gonna do – rent some ?
why not ?
perhaps we could borrow some .
- You mean a mock marriage ?
- I certainly do not .
I revere marriage , unlike some people I could mention .
Oh , here .
but why &quot; Captain McGlue &quot; ?
of all the idiotic names .
because I want him to build your airport for you , darling .
he seems to have something against my husband .
I don &apos;t know why . but as my brother –
apart from the fact that I wouldn &apos;t let him build a chicken coop for me ...
I &apos;d still like to know why I &apos;m to be called Captain McGlue .
- Of all the nincompoopish – - Wasn &apos;t that your mother &apos;s name ?
what – Captain McGlue ?
really , Geraldine .
her name was McGrew . M-C-G-R-E-W .
Oh , well , I &apos;m sorry , darling . I remembered it as McGlue .
Yes , well , I guess I &apos;m stuck with it now . Captain McGlue .
what am I supposed to be captain of – a garbage scow ?
I put that in to make it more dignified .
- Couldn &apos;t you have been a captain in the last war ?
- Sure .
I was 11 years old at the finish , a captain in knee britches .
- What about the Boy Scouts ?
- Wonderful .
I could go around building bonfires on the drawing room carpet .
I &apos;m sorry , darling . I really meant it for the best .
I know you did . that &apos;s what &apos;s so irritating about it .
where &apos;d you get the brother idea ?
because you had your arms around me .
I suppose no one &apos;s ever had his arms around you except your brother ... only you haven &apos;t got one .
I don &apos;t suppose Captain Hackensacker ever put his arms around you .
- Of course not . - Of course not .
yachts must have changed since the last time I was on one .
that &apos;s what they build yachts for .
naturally , he will put his arms around me when and if we &apos;re engaged .
- Oh , we &apos;re engaged now , are we ?
- Is there anything wrong with being engaged ?
you oughta know . where &apos;d you get that suit ?
that &apos;s what I was telling you about .
- What &apos;s that you &apos;ve got on your wrist ?
- Just what you think it is , dear .
- What kind of stones are those ?
- Exactly what they look like .
do you know what it feels like to be strangled with bare hands ?
Oh , now wait a minute , darling .
I &apos;ve always been on the level with you , and I always will be .
- Here . - What &apos;s that supposed to be ?
you put that over on the mantelpiece .
lovebirds , huh ?
now , so long as that &apos;s there ... you won &apos;t have the slightest , smallest thing to be unhappy about .
that &apos;ll be a signal , and we &apos;ll never have to mention the subject .
- And that goes for you too . - Huh ?
and your friend the princess you seem to be cutting such a groove with .
Princess .
say , where &apos;d you get the money to fly down here anyway ?
same place you got yours , only I didn &apos;t have to kiss him good-bye .
Oh , the Wienie King .
he wanted us to get back together , I guess .
don &apos;t you think we owe it to him ?
why don &apos;t you let me go out there and poke that guy in the nose ?
just once .
because I &apos;ve left you , darling , for both our good . now just –
excuse me .
Mac , did you happen to – You don &apos;t mind if I call you &quot; Mac , &quot; do you ?
- Did you happen to bring a tuxedo with you ?
- I did not .
the business I came here to tend to didn &apos;t call for one .
- And you can stop pulling my coat . - That &apos;s perfectly all right .
- In a pinch , you can wear one of mine . - In a pinch !
that &apos;s very funny .
- I won &apos;t be here that long . - Why , Mac .
that &apos;s too bad , old man . I &apos;d hoped you &apos;d spend the season with us .
I wanted to get to know you better .
there &apos;s something I want to talk to you about before you go .
- I &apos;m very glad you showed up when you did . - So am I .
- Good . I needed a male member of Gerry &apos;s family . - You have him .
fine . now I have a certain thought .
I have a certain thought also , and it &apos;s that bracelet .
- Mac !
- I &apos;m very glad you brought that up .
Mac is delighted with it , Snoodles .
- He shouldn &apos;t be . - He isn &apos;t .
fine . the first bracelet my sister got , I punched the fellow in the nose .
- Fellow by the name of Wallace . - I can see we understand each other perfectly .
- I didn &apos;t like it any more than you do this . - You &apos;re reading my mind .
splendid , but there &apos;s a difference between Wallace and me .
- I &apos;m not interested in Wallace . - There &apos;s no reason why you should be .
- Now I , on the other hand –
- If I could trust you two boys not to slug each other ...
I &apos;d like to make an exit right about here .
I feel like a bone between two dogs .
we &apos;re going to get along together all right .
there &apos;s nothing the matter with my intentions , as Mac will be the first to admit .
the only thing that could embarrass you ... would be the lovely things I want to say to him about you – your face , your form – things that a brother is naturally blind to .
- Is that so ?
- Geraldine &apos;s future ... and this little plan I have which I &apos;d better discuss with you before –
- What &apos;s buzzin &apos; , cousins ? what &apos;s the dirt ?
- Never mind , Maude .
- It &apos;s just a little something I want to discuss with Mac .
my dear , when you hear what it is , you will simply expire .
- Maude !
Maude , please !
- It &apos;s too , too excruciating !
he wants a miniature marriage with you .
- A miniature what ?
- Go away , Toto . this is not for children .
you know , everything up to the dissolve ... and then &quot; Good night , sweetheart .
I &apos;ll see you in the morning . &quot; - What &apos;s this ?
- The boy wants to bundle !
Maude .
and then he &apos;s gonna make you cook and sew and wash the windows ... and then he &apos;s gonna get some little brats to see if you know how to change them .
- But how ?
- He &apos;s going to rent them !
Oh !
let &apos;s you and me go someplace . they want to be alone .
- But just a minute . I –
- Don &apos;t take it so seriously .
- They want to bake a cake , dear . - They want to bake a wha –
well , I –
I don &apos;t know what to say .
I didn &apos;t realize it was so humorous .
did you really want to put me through all that ?
there &apos;s no use trying to conceal it now .
I might have guessed it on the train .
I certainly should have known it in Jacksonville and on the yacht .
the trial was as much for you as for me .
and however ridiculous I may seem ... there &apos;s nothing ridiculous about the way I feel in my heart .
- I &apos;m madly in love with you . - Aw .
Oh , isn &apos;t that pretty ?
why do you keep bothering them all the time ?
if you want to bother somebody , bother me .
you know , I &apos;m not sure that Mac likes me .
Oh , no , no , no . he &apos;s always like that .
it &apos;s just that he doesn &apos;t seem to think anybody &apos;s good enough for me .
well , he &apos;s right there .
you don &apos;t care much for me , do you ?
why , certainly .
why do you let me flop around ?
I &apos;m sorry .
you will care for me though . I grow on people – like moss .
sit down , Toto . stop following me around .
Zitz . - Nitz . - Yitz , Toto .
♪ Isn &apos;t it romantic ? ♪
♪ La-da-da-da da-dee-dee ♪ ♪
Oh , you have a nice little voice .
thank you . I used to sing in college .
- With a mandolin ?
- I wouldn &apos;t play it around the house .
- Would you be around the house much ?
- Not any more than you wanted me .
I have an office , not that I do much in it .
perhaps Mac could come and help me .
that would be wonderful !
- You two could plan the airport together .
- What airport is that ?
the most remarkable invention you &apos;ve ever heard of .
a suspended airport right in the middle of the city ... stretched like a tennis racket .
but would it be strong enough ? after all , a tennis racket –
- What &apos;s Gerry &apos;s husband like ?
- Who ?
Oh , just a flop .
- A big flop ?
- Yes , any way you take it .
well , he won &apos;t be such a flop with his $ 99,000 .
Snoodles will give it to him , all right . and why not ?
I oughta marry him and get it back into the family .
that would be a big joke . of course , I &apos;m crazy . I &apos;ll marry anyone .
- What &apos;s this about $ 99,000 ?
- I might be able to help him .
in fact , I will be able to help him . in fact , I &apos;ll help him . why not ?
- Will you really ?
- Of course I will , up to a certain point .
how much would a working model cost ?
Ninety-nine thou – I mean , $ 100,000 – in that neighborhood .
that shouldn &apos;t be a very difficult neighborhood to find .
I think I &apos;ll be able to do it all right .
Oh , really ?
you &apos;ve made me so happy .
- You don &apos;t know how much trouble he &apos;s had . - Is that so ?
he won &apos;t know what trouble really is till he tangles up with Maude .
Oh , that &apos;s rather unkind . I shouldn &apos;t have said it .
- You say about a hundred thousand ?
- Exactly a hundred thousand .
- It &apos;s built . - Oh !
you mean her husband wants $ 99,000 before he &apos;ll give her a divorce ?
Oh , I love you like this , with lightning flashing out of your eyes .
- Did she tell you that story ?
- Why should we talk about that heel when you &apos;re here ?
- Did she tell you that ?
- Do that again . I love it .
listen .
Oh , Snoodles , that &apos;s wonderful !
Tom – Mac will be wild with excitement .
you know , when you &apos;ve waited so long .
not at all . not at all . I &apos;m delighted to have the opportunity .
- Look – - Darling , I have the most wonderful news .
Snoodles is going to build your airport for you .
- Why should he build it ?
I &apos;ll build it . - You don &apos;t even know what it is .
quiet , Toto .
that gives us a lot to look forward to , doesn &apos;t it ?
I don &apos;t know as I &apos;ve told you , Mac ... but your sister and I have progressed considerably since this afternoon .
Oh , is that so ?
what &apos;s all this business about your husband wanting $ 99,000 ... before he sets you free ?
Oh , that was just an idea that he had .
you know how people are when they &apos;re upset .
I &apos;m not sure that he actually meant it . let &apos;s not even talk about it .
no , no , let &apos;s face it .
Gerry naturally wants to defend this human bacterium .
that &apos;s only natural and gallant . but the fact of the matter is he &apos;s asked her for it .
- And as soon as my name comes into it , we &apos;re doomed . - Broiled .
as a Hackensacker , I find it cheaper to pay than to fight .
of course , $ 99,000 isn &apos;t a small sum , but it isn &apos;t large .
I should say not . why , when I think of Stefan , to say nothing of Serge .
or that big one with the scar –
- What was his name ?
- Itsk .
Baron Itsk !
Lucius .
- Itsk ? - Nitz , Toto .
I &apos;m awfully sorry to hear that about Tom .
I knew he was a failure and a dreamer , I guess ... but I didn &apos;t know he was a skunk .
it &apos;s very kind of you to want to build the airport – I mean , the model of it .
I guess I was a little too stunned to say thank you ... but you know how it is when you &apos;ve been waiting for something for a long time .
there &apos;s only one trouble with the whole setup ... something that Gerry neglected to tell you .
that is that I &apos;m not alone in this invention .
that human bacterium we were talking about – her husband – has had exactly as much to do with it as I have .
so , you see , if you help me , you &apos;d be helping him too .
I know nothing could be further from your wish .
how about dancing with your brother ?
shut up , Toto . my brother is thinking .
what did you have to do that for , you fathead ?
don &apos;t you ever get tired of being noble ?
everything I build up for you you knock down .
- I &apos;ve got you the money twice already . - Look , darling –
no , I don &apos;t want to listen to anything that begins with &quot; Look , darling &quot; ... so that you can get off another noble saying .
can &apos;t you ever learn to be practical ?
don &apos;t you know that the greatest men in the world have told lies ... and let things be misunderstood if it was useful to them ?
didn &apos;t you ever hear of a campaign promise ?
the way you are is the way you have to be , honey .
that &apos;s the way I am . if I &apos;m supposed to be a flop –
you &apos;re not going to be a flop .
nobody who &apos;s been married to me for five years is going to be a flop .
you &apos;re going to get your airport ... if I have to build it for you myself .
after I &apos;m married .
after you &apos;re married .
that &apos;s a funny thing to hear your wife say .
I &apos;ll build it , and his share will be more than $ 99,000 ... so he &apos;ll have to release you .
- Whose share ?
- That scoundrel she &apos;s married to .
isn &apos;t that brilliant ?
it &apos;s the first bright thought he &apos;s ever had .
- That &apos;s marvelous !
- It was really very simple .
now shall we change partners ?
it seems a shame ... to waste such a beautiful sister upon a brother that doesn &apos;t appreciate her .
you said it .
Ah , thank you so much . it was delightful .
not at all .
Oh , dear !
- What &apos;s the matter ?
- We must &apos;ve forgotten Toto someplace .
- Oh , is that so ?
- I suppose he &apos;ll show up though . he always does .
- Greetings !
- Ah , yes .
wouldn &apos;t he be awful to be married to ?
always hanging around .
Captain , you have renewed my faith in mankind .
well , there &apos;s nothing like saving your faith .
you are too , too divine !
you &apos;re a very embarrassing lady .
if I weren &apos;t a little bit mixed up at the moment ...
I &apos;d take you up on a few of your dares and make you say &quot; papa . &quot;
Papa .
how would you like to go to Fort Myers tomorrow ?
there &apos;s nothing there , but the ride might be nice .
- We might put Toto in the army . - I may not be here tomorrow .
what do you mean you may not be here tomorrow ?
I &apos;m a little mixed up , but I sort of have an appointment in New York .
Oh , let her wait , whoever she is .
she &apos;s no good for you anyway , while I , on the other hand –
you never think of anything but topic &quot; A , &quot; do you ?
is there anything else ?
I &apos;ll leave you with that thought , Captain .
Bonsoir , Drip-drap .
Oh , dear . you &apos;re very kind .
I think this is the happiest night of my life .
- Oh , really , Snoodles ?
- Yes .
you &apos;ve freed me of a certain timidity from which I &apos;ve always suffered .
and now with you and Mac and the airport ...
- I can see great days ahead full of fun and everything . - I &apos;m sure of it , Snoodles .
by the way , I have a little surprise for you in a few minutes .
- So don &apos;t be surprised . - What is it ?
if I told you what it is , then it wouldn &apos;t be a surprise anymore .
well , I wouldn &apos;t do anything too surprising if I were you , Snoodles .
you never can tell how those things are going to turn out .
I &apos;m persuaded you &apos;ll be delighted .
well , I certainly hope I will be .
- If you &apos;ll just leave your window open onto the balcony . - What ?
what was that ?
- Oh , I didn &apos;t hear anything . good night , Snoodles . - I &apos;ll see you in a little while .
- Good night . - I &apos;ll see you in my dreams .
Yes , that &apos;s a very good place .
- You &apos;re a fast worker , aren &apos;t you ?
- You have your nerve to talk .
so you couldn &apos;t even wait a decent interval , you and your princess .
I hope you &apos;re very proud of yourself , Captain McGlue !
- Wait a minute . - No , let me go , you big pullover !
no , no . I just broke that because it was handy .
Oh ! well , then you ought to be ashamed of yourself .
- I &apos;m the one that has the right to –
- I know I &apos;m an idiot .
but I suppose it &apos;s when you &apos;ve been fond of somebody for a long time –
you shouldn &apos;t have come down here .
you had no right to come down here .
you should have given me a little time to get used to the idea .
maybe I should , but you can &apos;t blame a man ... for trying to hold on to something that he loves ... that he always has loved and always will love .
- You &apos;re going to make me cry . - Gerry .
no !
you &apos;re forgetting the airport .
you &apos;re forgetting everything that counts .
- Gerry . - No !
it &apos;s all finished !
when you make a decision , you have to stand by it .
you can &apos;t let champagne or – or tree toads ... or night flowers or memories get in the way of it .
- It &apos;s all over . I-I know it &apos;s for the best . - But , Gerry , I –
on , no . now listen to me just this once , will you ?
I &apos;ve always done what you wanted , and it &apos;s always turned out a disaster .
good night , darling . sleep tight .
it &apos;ll be funny sleeping with a sitting room between us .
- And the doors locked . - You won &apos;t have to worry about that .
nevertheless , good night , dear .
- What ?
- Well , don &apos;t you kiss your brother good night ?
I don &apos;t know . I never had a brother .
you have one now .
you fool .

- I suppose there &apos;s a law against shooting those things . - Yes , ma &apos;am , I think there is .
- Oh , good morning , Toto . - Greetings .
it doesn &apos;t seem to matter how much champagne you soak up ... you always feel great the next morning .
- Hello . - Thank you , darling .
I suppose it takes an iron constitution to be a houseguest .
- Why don &apos;t you go away someplace ? - Eh ?
there must be somebody else who can use a houseguest .
I can &apos;t be the only sucker in the world . why don &apos;t you go to Havana ?
that &apos;s a nice place , and I &apos;d treat you to a nice one-way ticket .
Havanag ?
Youg , meeg – Havanag ?
Nog , Toto . Youg – Havanag . meeg – here .
- Nitz . - I was afraid of that .
say , Maude , is this all right ?
you have to work fast in these matters .
so I just slid down to Margetson &apos;s and slid back with this . Hello .
- What is it – the Hope Blue ?
- No , no . it &apos;s just a chip from it .
boy , when you fall , you fall , don &apos;t you ?
- Go away , Toto . this might give you ideas . - It &apos;s all right then ?
- I think she &apos;ll know what you mean . - Good .
how do you think this would look on the captain &apos;s vest ?
Maude , you &apos;re really incorrigible .
no , no , Toto . naughty , naughty . here .
I suppose I &apos;ll have to give the bracelet back , won &apos;t I ?
- Why ?
- Oh !
Oh , dear .
what are you talking about ?
Oh , Snoodles , I &apos;m so fond of you .
you &apos;re a lovely , generous , good-hearted man , really a woman &apos;s ideal .
- Only you shouldn &apos;t have sung last night . - What ?
here &apos;s your bracelet . I &apos;m going back to my husband .
- That skunk ?
- Oh , he isn &apos;t really .
I let you think much worse about him than he is .
you know how a woman likes sympathy .
- But what about the $ 99,000 ?
- He didn &apos;t want that . I wanted it for him .
but –
- Put it away . - What ?
- Put it away . - But , darling –
I &apos;ll just take one more look at it , and then put it away forever .
there &apos;s a limit to what a woman can stand .
Hello there , Snoodles . how &apos;s every little thing ?
- I &apos;m very unhappy , as a matter of fact . - You &apos;ll get over it .
- Do you know about Gerry &apos;s decision ?
- Yes .
I &apos;ll never get over it as long as I live . I had such hopes , such plans .
Oh , Snoodles , I &apos;m so sorry .
anyway , we still have the airport . that &apos;ll keep us busy .
- What &apos;s knittin &apos; , kittens ?
- Gerry &apos;s going back to her husband .
Oh , you poor , dumb thing . I know just how it is . I &apos;ll bet he &apos;s a knockout .
- I &apos;m awfully sorry about Snoodles . - You still have your airport .
you and the captain and I will be as busy as bird dogs , won &apos;t we ?
- I &apos;m afraid that isn &apos;t possible either . - Why not ?
I still have – I always will have – the deepest affection for you .
certainly nothing has happened to spoil my friendship with your brother .
being with him will remind me of you .
- Well , you see –
- What now ?
- He isn &apos;t exactly my brother . - No .
- He isn &apos;t exactly your brother ?
Hello !
Oh , shut up .
he-he – He &apos;s my husband .
- He &apos;s your husband !
- That &apos;s right .
well , no wonder !
I thought I was losing my grip .
- You mean the vermin who-who –
- Who-Who what ?
- That &apos;s right . you said he didn &apos;t . - Then who is McGlue ?
- There is no McGlue . - Well , thank heavens for something . that name !
then it &apos;s the Jeffers Airport . that &apos;s it , isn &apos;t it ?
are you still talking about that airport ?
you really take it on the chin , don &apos;t you ?
why not ?
if an idea has merit , it has merit .
sentiment and business don &apos;t belong in the same bed .
after all , Grandfather loathed oil – it made his eyes water – but that didn &apos;t stop him from making millions out of it .
you still want to go through with the airport ?
why not ?
on a purely business basis , of course .
right now , I don &apos;t like you , although I may get over it later .
right now , I need something to occupy my mind .
the airport is something , if not exactly what I &apos;d hoped for .
- I &apos;ll be very lonely without you , Gerry . - Oh , Captain , and thou .
I don &apos;t suppose you have a sister .
only a twin sister .
- A twin sister !
- Oh , didn &apos;t you know about that ?
that &apos;s how we were married in the beginning , both being twins .
- That &apos;s another plot entirely . - Both twins !
- Are you a twin ?
- Yes .
- Well , what &apos;s he doing ?
- Well , what &apos;s she doing ?
- Well , nothing .
here come the wolves .
Uh-oh . Bottleneck . Mr. Roosevelt should hear of this .
I &apos;m sorry . hope you didn &apos;t hurt yourself .
my friend says he &apos;s sorry .
okay .
that just goes to show you what a little blonde can do to hold up national defense .
nice , pleasant guy .
man ! gee , 100 bucks .
so that &apos;s what they look like .
where &apos;d he go ? I don &apos;t know . I wonder what his name is .
wait a minute . I saw it on the envelope .
Fry . that &apos;s it . Fry .
Fry . how do you know my name ?
what do you care how I know your name ?
I saw it on one of the envelopes you dropped .
here &apos;s something that belongs to you .
the paint shop !
lt &apos;ll go up like dynamite !
here , take this one . what about me ? don &apos;t I get to play , too ?
so , I see these two kids , see .
and I yell at them , &quot; The sprinklers are busted ,
&quot; the whole shooting match will go up . &quot;
and they run right in , the both of them .
and the last thing I saw when I looked back was one kid give the extinguisher to the other kid , and then it was just like all hell comes up .
that &apos;s all I see .
was there anybody else around ? no .
just the two kids .
the poor kid with the extinguisher , and the one who gave it to him . thank you , Rogers .
we appreciate all you &apos;ve done .
we needn &apos;t keep you any longer now .
you &apos;d better go and take care of those hands .
who &apos;ve you got next ?
we have a fellow , Barry Kane , waiting .
send Barry Kane in !
Barry Kane !
just take it easy .
we only want to ask you a couple of questions , a matter of a routine check-up .
well , I want to do anything I can to help .
sure .
now , suppose you tell us where you were when the fire started .
well , I was one of the first to rush in .
the sprinkler systems weren &apos;t working .
who else was with you ?
there were just myself , a fellow named Fry , and my friend Ken Mason .
go on . Fry handed me an extinguisher , and I started running toward the fire .
I gave it to Ken .
and then he ...
okay . take it easy . that &apos;s all .
just stick around for a while . we may need you . send for Fry .
get hold of a fellow called Fry .
what &apos;d they do ? ask you a lot of questions ? no .
hardly any . gee , it &apos;s awful tough going , seeing it happen in front of you .
Yeah , it is tough .
Ken Mason was your pal , too , wasn &apos;t he ? Yeah .
was he married ? no . he was living with his mother .
must be pretty tough on her . sorry , fellows .
I &apos;ll see you later .
Hello , Mrs. Mason .
they ... They wouldn &apos;t let me see him . it &apos;s awful hard to believe .
it happened so quick .
why , only this morning ...
please ... Please don &apos;t talk about it now .
anything I can do ? could I get you something ? no .
no , thank you . not now .
maybe some brandy .
how is the poor , dear soul ?
if you mean Mrs. Mason , she &apos;s feeling bad .
Oh , well , she has every reason to . do you know what ?
they wouldn &apos;t even let her see him .
her only son .
Yes , I know .
I told her she &apos;d every right to insist on seeing him .
I told her I would , and she as good as told me to get out .
me that was only trying to help the poor , dear soul .
I think you can help , if you &apos;d tell me where I could get some brandy .
it doesn &apos;t seem to be in here .
you come with me , young man .
it just happens that I have a little in the house .
sorry to bother you , Mrs. Mason , but we &apos;re looking for a guy named Barry Kane .
he isn &apos;t here right now , is he ?
they told us at the plant we might be able to find him here .
well , what do you want to see him about ?
he &apos;s in pretty bad trouble , lady .
what is it ? I &apos;d like to know .
he was mixed up with that fire at the factory . I ...
I don &apos;t understand .
there are a lot of things we don &apos;t understand , either .
but how is Barry involved in it ?
that fire extinguisher . it seems it wasn &apos;t just an accident .
it turns out that the extinguisher Barry Kane handed your son was filled with gasoline .
you ought to be able to help us .
give us a lead on this guy Kane .
Yeah . that &apos;s why we want to look around . well ...
I can &apos;t talk about it now . Yeah .
sorry , but , you see , there was a ...
I wouldn &apos;t give her too much of that if I were you , because it very often makes people weepy . I know it affected me like that ...
Yes , Mrs. Moore , I &apos;ve got to hurry back .
thank you very much .
try some of this , Mrs. Mason . it &apos;ll make you feel better .
there were two detectives just here .
they were looking for you . for me ?
I guess they want to ask me some more questions .
I said that I &apos;d do anything I could to help . here .
try , please . no . that wasn &apos;t it .
they said that the fire extinguisher that you handed to Kenneth was filled with gasoline , that you killed him .
that I killed ...
why , are they crazy ? why would I want to do a thing ...
why , Ken was my best friend ! haven &apos;t they talked to Fry ?
haven &apos;t they asked him about the extinguisher ?
they said that there was no such man employed at the plant as Fry .
why , I saw him ! I saw him twice !
Ken saw him , too ! he was right there with us at the fire . he handed me the extinguisher .
Ken said , &quot; Don &apos;t I get to play , too ? &quot;
he was kidding . I handed it to him .
Fry was right there with us . I &apos;m sure !
why , he must have known there was gasoline in it .
he must have known !
he stood right there with us and watched , the ...
please go .
don &apos;t you believe me ?
do you think I had something to do with this ?
I didn &apos;t tell the police anything .
Oh , I don &apos;t know ! it &apos;s all so confused and so terrible .
I don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about !
why don &apos;t they get this fellow Fry ?
you &apos;d better go .
all right , I &apos;ll go .
I &apos;ve got to get Fry .
I &apos;ve got to find him , or Ken won &apos;t be the last one to die .
he must be in there . I saw him go in the back way .
Catchy . what ?
that tune you &apos;re whistling .
Oh , I didn &apos;t even know I was whistling .
that &apos;s a sign you must be pretty happy .
easy to see there &apos;s nothing on your mind .
oops . that must have been Junior .
it felt like him . Junior ?
Yeah , that rock we just got .
I know every one on the road from Los Angeles to Reno .
tough job , driving a truck .
got any other hot news tonight ?
I guess I never realized how tough it was before .
the tough part , you can take that .
it &apos;s the monotony that gets you . I &apos;ve been thinking for a long time I &apos;m gonna get out of this trucking game .
why don &apos;t you ?
one of the neighbors told my wife it &apos;s stylish to eat three meals a day .
you married ? Nope .
go ahead and whistle .
that thing bother you ?
what &apos;s doing it ?
here , stick this wad of paper in there , will you ?
it &apos;s a pretty good thing to have around one of these extinguishers .
I wouldn &apos;t be without one .
now , take the other day .
a big lettuce truck turns over right down the road here .
the gasoline catches and she goes up like a matchbox .
a fellow riding , a friend of the driver &apos;s , gets caught in it .
if the driver hadn &apos;t had an extinguisher , his pal would &apos;ve been fried alive right in front of his eyes .
I didn &apos;t see it happen . I never see anything happen .
I don &apos;t even hear about anything , except what my wife tells me what she sees in the moving pictures .
that &apos;s the way she spends the money , moving pictures and new hats .
buys a new hat so she can put it on to go to the picture shows , so she can take it off .
no , sir . I haven &apos;t got anything to whistle about .
where &apos;re you from , bud ?
Los Angeles .
tough .
you work down there ? Yeah . well , I did .
what doing ?
I was working in an airplane factory .
they say that &apos;s pretty good .
I was wondering why you weren &apos;t in the army .
Yeah . I understand that they all go particular about the fellows they hire in those big defense plants .
well , that &apos;s no more than right .
they got to be careful they don &apos;t get blown up .
Yeah .
I understand if a fellow would &apos;ve had any kind of police record , no job .
is that right ? Oh , I don &apos;t know .
Hey , buddy , hold the wheel a while , will you ?
while I animate this thing . I &apos;m a nicotine addict .
Hey , watch it , bud , will you ? stay on this side of the white line .
where do you wanna get off when we get to Springville ?
it doesn &apos;t matter . just drop me in the middle of town , anywhere , when we get there .
listen , the minute you get to Springville , you &apos;re in the middle of the town .
and the next minute , the place is just a memory .
whole town isn &apos;t a city block long .
you going to one of those big ranches , outside , aren &apos;t you ?
Yeah .
I &apos;d be glad to drop you off at whatever one you want .
that &apos;s it ! deep Springs Ranch .
Hey ! say , that &apos;s a whale of a big place .
got a chance of a job there ? Yeah .
I think so .
you ought to like it . nice climate . the police !
maybe something &apos;s happened !
I &apos;d like to have a little talk with you out here .
Yeah , sure , sure , Officer . stay here a minute , buddy . I &apos;ll be right back .
Hey , bud ! come on . everything &apos;s fixed .
good night , Officer .
can you imagine a thing like that ?
cop chasing , the sirens , the whole works !
and what it &apos;s all about is one of my taillights went out .
that &apos;s the trucking game for you in a nutshell .
calling all highway patrolmen . calling all highway patrolmen .
be on lookout for a man named Barry Kane .
last seen on Highway 99 .
he has dark brown hair , blue eyes , height about 6 &apos; 2 &quot; , no hat , around 25 years old .
calling all highway patrolmen .
how do you do ? is Mr. Frank Fry here ?
no , this is Mr. Tobin &apos;s ranch .
Oh . could I speak to Mr. Tobin ?
well , I &apos;ll see . just a minute . you wait here , please .
there . we &apos;ve got the ball . now , throw it to me .
a young man to see you , sir .
throw it to me . where is Daddy &apos;s girl ?
what did you say , Adele ? who wants to see me ?
a young man , sir . he came to ask for a Mr. Fry .
Oh . well , have him come out here , will you ?
Yes , sir . throw me the ball . throw me the ball .
here comes your granddaddy .
Mr. Tobin will see you . follow me , please . Hi .
how do you do ? I &apos;m Charles Tobin .
this is my daughter , Mrs. Brown . how do you do ?
how do you do ?
well , I &apos;m not gonna ask you to excuse the informality of this costume .
we &apos;re all informal out here at Deep Springs Ranch .
that &apos;s one of the rules of the place . I see .
do you want me to take Susie with me so you won &apos;t be disturbed ?
no , Susie isn &apos;t gonna disturb us at all .
you just let her play right here , and I &apos;ll see she doesn &apos;t fall in the pool .
all right .
well , shall we sit out here ?
Yes , sir . it seems a shame to go indoors on such a beautiful day .
Yes , it does .
you wanted to see me about something , huh ?
Yes , sir . I &apos;m looking for a man named Fry , Frank Fry .
I met him up in Los Angeles . I understand he lives here .
Oh , no , no .
Fry , huh ?
Frank Fry ? I &apos;m afraid I don &apos;t know anybody by that name .
wait a minute . Fry . no , no .
I just don &apos;t seem to be able to place it . Uh-huh .
there used to be a fellow with a name something like that , worked around here .
no . no . it wasn &apos;t Fry .
well , I &apos;m afraid you found the wrong address .
it couldn &apos;t be one of the cowhands , or maybe somebody who is working ...
no . no . I know the names of all my men .
wait a minute . my next door neighbor ...
well , next door neighbor , he lives 20 miles from here .
but he may know your friend .
I &apos;ll telephone him .
Oh , no , please don &apos;t . no ! not at all .
you look as though you &apos;ve had a hard journey .
it &apos;s just too bad you had to come all this way for nothing .
now , if you &apos;ll just wait a minute , at least we can find out .
will you see that Susie doesn &apos;t fall into the pool ? Yes , sir . thank you .
Hey . come here .
come over here .
Oh , so you &apos;re a ballplayer , are you ? wanna throw me the ball ?
let me have it . come on . throw me the ball .
that &apos;s right . throw me the other one . come on .
throw it to me . come on . give me the ball .
that &apos;s fine . fine ! now , I &apos;ll throw it back .
where are you going ? Uh-oh . don &apos;t do that .
leave those where they are . leave them right there .
you wanna be a good girl ? put these back where you found them . no , no , Susie .
the gentleman says put them back where you found them .
the gentleman knows that you must be very careful with letters that don &apos;t belong to you .
probably I &apos;m prejudiced , but it seems to me that Susie is a pretty cute young lady .
Yeah , she &apos;s great . where &apos;s Frank Fry ?
well , really , you must do something about that memory of yours .
you know that it wasn &apos;t a minute ago that you read a telegram that Fry sent me .
and it said that he was on his way to Soda City .
don &apos;t you remember that ?
where &apos;s Soda City ?
well , I haven &apos;t given it much thought , but I wouldn &apos;t imagine there &apos;d be an overabundance of Soda Citys on the map .
I suppose there &apos;s some way of finding out bringing you last-minute headlines .
Los Angeles .
the fire in the Stewart Aircraft Works , in which one man was killed , many injured , and half a million dollars worth of damage caused , has been definitely set down to sabotage .
police have traced the incendiary origin of the blaze to Barry Kane , former aircraft ...
don &apos;t want any more of that .
you &apos;d think you &apos;d be rather bored with descriptions of yourself .
or maybe you &apos;ll never get tired of them .
well , I am , by this time . I &apos;ve been listening to those radio reports all morning .
all right , you knew me . what about it ?
Oh , quite a lot about it , Mr. Kane . you ought to know that .
you &apos;ve become too famous to remain so modest .
tell me one thing .
why are you covering up Frank Fry ?
what &apos;s a man like you in this for ?
well , young man , I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
I think maybe you do !
Frank Fry is a saboteur who doesn &apos;t mind killing Americans for money .
you must watch yourself , Mr. Kane .
I &apos;m telling you this for your own benefit , but you have the makings of an outstanding bore .
you can &apos;t get away with this , Tobin !
even if I don &apos;t stop you , there &apos;ll be others who will .
a man like you can &apos;t last in a country like this .
very pretty speech .
Youthful , passionate , idealistic .
you see , I &apos;ve already sent for the police .
you can &apos;t bluff me . you &apos;re hooked , and you know it .
must I remind you that you are the fugitive from justice , and not I ?
I &apos;m a prominent citizen , widely respected .
you are an obscure young workman , wanted for the committing of an extremely unpopular crime .
now , which of us do you think the police will believe , hmm ?
Oh , you must think me a very poor host , Mr. Kane .
now , don &apos;t you feel that a long cold drink is indicated ?
well , I guess I &apos;ve found out everything you &apos;re gonna tell me .
I &apos;ll have to go on now and do the rest by myself .
you mean you wish to leave us ?
Adele , Adele ! Mr. Kane is going !
I &apos;m sorry . you &apos;ll stop , please .
what does that shoot ? water ? bullets , I &apos;m afraid .
you shouldn &apos;t be so anxious to leave us , Mr. Kane .
you &apos;ll hurt our feelings .
you make it very hard for me to refuse your invitations . Susie , come on .
no , no , Susie !
come here . Hello , Susie .
you know where we &apos;re going ? we &apos;re going for a piggyback ride .
that &apos;s right . you like piggyback rides ?
get after him ! hurry up ! get him !
get after him ! hurry up !
get going . wait a minute .
you can &apos;t take me away like this !
don &apos;t tell us what we can &apos;t do , chum . go on , get started .
I tell you , you &apos;ve got to get him !
just because he &apos;s got a big ranch and a fancy pool and a lovely house doesn &apos;t mean he &apos;s a nice guy .
why don &apos;t you find out the kind of things he &apos;s been doing ? sure , sure .
we know all about that . just come on along . the baby had the letters , I tell you .
Oh , of course , Susie would be only too glad to cooperate , but , you see , it &apos;ll be quite a few months before she &apos;ll be of any assistance .
no , no , Susie . those are not for Susie .
those are for the gentleman . all right , let &apos;s go .
where &apos;re we going ?
we &apos;re gonna let you get a little idea of the county jail .
you won &apos;t find it the best in the West .
but it won &apos;t hurt you to rough it for a couple of days till they come up from Los Angeles for you .
you can &apos;t hold me without a warrant .
chum , do I have to keep asking you not to tell us what we can &apos;t do ?
you give me a break . there isn &apos;t time !
time &apos;s the one thing you don &apos;t need to worry about .
you &apos;ll have it to burn .
you &apos;ll have 20 years , nice and quiet , if you get the right lawyer .
and if you don &apos;t , you &apos;ll have all the time there is . what &apos;s wrong , Mac ?
what &apos;s holding us up ?
truck ahead , blocking the whole road .
looks like they &apos;re changing a tire .
got a cigarette ? sure . all you want .
Hiya , bud ! Hey , what &apos;s the matter ?
there he goes ! there he is !
Hello there . Hello .
I got caught in this storm . I &apos;m pretty wet , I &apos;m afraid .
maybe you &apos;d like to come inside and get dry .
did you leave your car down on the road ? why don &apos;t you bring it up and put it in the shed ?
I &apos;m afraid it won &apos;t do it any good standing in the rain .
I don &apos;t have any car .
you might say I &apos;m traveling by thumb .
by thumb ? Yeah , I &apos;m a hitchhiker .
Oh , I see .
I &apos;ve always thought that , that was the best way to learn about this country and the surest test of the American heart .
Yes , I guess it is .
will you go to the fire and dry your clothes ? thanks .
thanks .
I think that they &apos;d dry more quickly if you hung them up and put on something of mine .
Oh , no , thanks ! this is fine .
we could do with another log on the fire . would you ?
why , sure .
you must stay until this blows over .
it won &apos;t detain you long .
these autumn storms are short .
they yield to none in wetness , but they are short . Yes , I ...
I &apos;m sorry , I should have warned you . those logs are heavier than you &apos;d think .
I drop them constantly .
Yes , they are heavy .
I guess I was too smart trying to pick it up with one hand .
good job it didn &apos;t land on your foot .
that often happens to me . you &apos;re lucky . Yeah .
I &apos;m lucky .
Oh , I was forgetting . my name is Phillip Martin .
Oh , I &apos;m Barry ... Mason .
I &apos;m glad you found yourself near here , Mr. Mason , when the storm came .
it &apos;s a pleasant thing to have a guest sharing the fire when the rain is beating on the roof .
you live here alone , do you , sir ? Yes .
except I really don &apos;t think of it in that way .
you see , sounds are my light and my colors . my music , for example .
I compose a little .
and there &apos;s nobody to tell me that the results are anything but brilliant , so I live in a comfortable glow of self-appreciation .
I &apos;m afraid I prefer playing the works of other composers .
undoubtedly , you &apos;d prefer listening to them .
I used to play the triangle in our high school band .
of course that was a long time ago . Oh , that &apos;s too bad .
it &apos;s unfortunate when you let yourself get out of practice on the triangle .
the piano is a boon to me .
the piano can &apos;t know that you &apos;re blind , so it doesn &apos;t embarrass you by trying to make things easier for you .
it does you the compliment to trust you .
Delius , the British composer , was blind too .
that &apos;s our only resemblance .
this is his Summer Night on the River .
a very interesting effect , obligato on an apple .
Oh , I apologize , Mr. Mason .
I forgot how hungry you must be after your long walk . just a moment .
I &apos;ll get something .
Oh , no . thanks . this is fine .
I like apples . so do I. We &apos;ll save them for dessert .
it was all ready , you see .
all I needed was a reminder that I was hungry , too .
are you dry enough ? just about , sir .
it stopped raining .
is that a car coming ?
two cars , I think . excuse me .
one car is my niece &apos;s . I &apos;d know the sound of that motor anywhere .
the other is a stranger to me .
there &apos;s a couple of men in it . the girl &apos;s standing beside it , pointing down the road .
they must &apos;ve asked her where to go .
this is an easy country to lose your way in .
that &apos;s one of its charms . the car is moving .
it &apos;s starting off down the road now .
the girl &apos;s coming up the path .
that &apos;s my niece . she &apos;s been staying with me .
she comes from New York to spend a month with me every year .
it &apos;s one of my greatest pleasures .
Unhappily for me , she can &apos;t stay longer .
after a month she finds the quiet deafening . Oh , Uncle Phillip .
Hello , old boy .
Uncle Phillip , what do you think happened ?
you didn &apos;t know we had a guest .
you turned your back and see what happens .
my niece , Patricia Martin , Mr. Mason .
how do you do ?
Uncle Phillip , there was a car full of detectives down the road .
they wanted to know the way to town .
they &apos;re searching for a man that got away from them .
it was on all the radios and everything .
they said he &apos;s a really dangerous criminal . he ...
my dear , the police are always on the alarmist side .
but they said this man is really dangerous .
I &apos;m sure they did .
how could they be heroes if he were harmless ?
Pat , dear , would you mind not having any further quotations from the police ?
their remarks are always so expected .
they kill conversation .
you &apos;ve probably seen the face of my niece before , Mr. Mason . why , yes .
I was wondering where I &apos;d seen ...
as a matter of fact , you &apos;ve seen her practically everywhere .
I &apos;m told that billboards she adorns would reach across the continent , if placed end to end .
but I can &apos;t imagine who &apos;s going to place them end to end , nor why they should consider it the thing to do .
Uncle Phillip never has really been enthusiastic over my career as a model .
Oh , well , relatives are like that .
my , aren &apos;t you two mean , going ahead and eating without me . I &apos;m starving .
would you pass me one of those plates , please , Mr. Mason ?
Oh ! what &apos;s the matter , Pat ? have you just seen his handcuffs ?
I heard them as soon as he came in .
Uncle Phillip , he must be the man they &apos;re looking for !
Yes , very probably .
but you should have given him to the police .
are you frightened , Pat ? is that what makes you so cruel ?
but you &apos;ve got to ! he &apos;s a dangerous man .
Oh , Pat , come on .
Mr. Mason may be many things , but he &apos;s certainly not dangerous . in fact , I &apos;m not at all convinced that he &apos;s guilty .
Uncle Phillip , it &apos;s your duty as an American citizen .
it is my duty as an American citizen to believe a man innocent until he &apos;s been proved guilty .
Pat , don &apos;t tell me about my duty .
it makes you sound so stuffy .
besides , I have my own ideas about my duties as a citizen .
they sometimes involve disregarding the law .
but what are you going to do ? what are you going to do with him ?
I &apos;m going to turn him over to you , my dear .
and you &apos;re going to drive him down to Tim , the blacksmith , and have those preposterous contraptions removed from his wrists .
Oh , Uncle Phillip , how could I do a thing like that ?
because , you know , I can see a great deal farther than you can .
I can see intangible things . for example , innocence .
will you go with my niece , Mr. Mason ?
Oh , yes , sir ! if you don &apos;t mind ?
but what &apos;ll I tell the blacksmith ?
tell him Mr. Mason is my friend and my guest .
he won &apos;t ask any other questions .
go ahead , Pat . go with her , Barry .
Barry , I know , is your name .
your voice explained to me that Mason isn &apos;t .
but as I told you before , names are of such little importance .
I don &apos;t know how to thank you , Mr. Martin . go ahead , Barry .
go ahead .
and do the things I wish I could do .
good luck , Barry , and for heaven &apos;s sake , get back in practice on that triangle !
is the blacksmith &apos;s shop very far ?
not very , right along here . and is he ...
is he really all right ?
he and my uncle are great friends . Oh .
I guess he &apos;s all right , then .
you needn &apos;t worry . he &apos;s all right .
he &apos;s a darling blacksmith .
only I &apos;m not quite sure how much experience he &apos;s had with handcuffs .
do you mind if I see them ? I wonder what he &apos;ll have to do to get them off .
I can &apos;t quite see .
could you hold them a little nearer ? now I feel better .
I &apos;ll bet you do .
I &apos;ll bet this just makes you feel great , doesn &apos;t it ?
in case you &apos;re interested , the blacksmith &apos;s shop is two miles back .
we &apos;re on our way to the police .
your uncle &apos;s certainly gonna be proud of you !
the world isn &apos;t full of kind old gentlemen , like my uncle .
you &apos;re gonna find that out . even my uncle wouldn &apos;t have been so kind if he &apos;d known more about you .
all right , go ahead .
what did I do ?
I &apos;d be kind of happy to know .
if it had been any other sort of crime , if a man had stolen because he was starving , even if a man committed murder to defend himself , maybe I wouldn &apos;t tell the police .
but there &apos;s only one reason why a man commits sabotage .
that &apos;s worse than murder .
surprise for you , Miss Martin , I agree with every word you say .
please don &apos;t talk to me anymore .
that will be my pleasure . well !
I &apos;ll see that she doesn &apos;t !
never try driving this way . it hurts .
I &apos;m stopping the first car I see .
help ! come on .
I can &apos;t get along without you . let go of me !
help ! help ! get the police !
help !
my , they must be terribly in love .
looks as though this car has been overheated .
fan &apos;s broken .
I &apos;m cold . Yeah , I know .
and you &apos;re hungry .
now mostly I &apos;m cold .
look , if you &apos;d stop trying to be a hero and decide to be on my side , maybe we could do something about your being cold .
build a fire ?
no , I wasn &apos;t exactly thinking of that .
well , I didn &apos;t want to insult you by not even trying .
what do you want to turn me in for ?
haven &apos;t you got your picture stuck up in enough places now ?
I just want to do my duty .
that &apos;s hard for you to understand .
why won &apos;t you believe I &apos;m all right ?
&apos;Cause you still don &apos;t make sense .
if you really hadn &apos;t done it , you would &apos;ve gone to the police .
I &apos;ve told you it &apos;s a question of time !
if I go to the police , it &apos;d take me weeks to convince them .
if they &apos;re as dumb as you are , it &apos;ll take me months .
do you think we &apos;re very far from Soda City ?
I don &apos;t know . we &apos;ll ask at the next town , if there &apos;s a next town .
well , anyway , I don &apos;t believe that part about Tobin .
you don &apos;t believe it because he &apos;s got a big ranch and a beautiful pool and ...
it &apos;s just hard to believe that about any American .
well , you believe it about me !
well , you &apos;re different . you look like a saboteur .
you have a saboteur &apos;s disposition .
don &apos;t tell me you &apos;ve decided to be on my side .
no , I &apos;m cold .
say , aren &apos;t you wasting your very valuable time , sitting up here admiring the scenery ?
Hey , look at that . looks like we &apos;ve got company .
what do you suppose all that &apos;s doing way up here ?
they aren &apos;t moving very fast , are they ?
you know what we can do ?
Oh , no , you won &apos;t .
sorry , honey , I can &apos;t take a chance .
you &apos;re right . I &apos;d turn you in at the first opportunity I get .
let go of me ! let me go ! Ouch !
help ! help !
won &apos;t you give me one break ?
won &apos;t you wait till we get to Soda City ?
all right . I &apos;m sorry I &apos;ve got to leave you here alone .
but I told you what I &apos;ve got to do , and I &apos;m gonna do it .
there &apos;s only one thing I want to warn you about , snakes .
there &apos;re a lot of them out here .
of course , there &apos;s only five or six poisonous kinds , but there are a lot of the long , squirmy , slippery , slimy ones .
Barry !
I &apos;m coming up in the world . now I &apos;m better than the snakes .
Barry , please !
are you with me ? Yes , yes !
now , what made you change your mind ?
I can &apos;t turn you in if I &apos;m stuck out there .
Oh , so that &apos;s it . go back with the reptiles .
let me go !
who &apos;s there ? you &apos;ve got no right here !
stop it and get off !
now , now , Major . Ah , stowaways .
in the middle of this desert sea , we acquire two more vagabonds .
Bedouins like ourselves , eh , Esmeralda ?
why , they &apos;re just a couple of kids .
our car broke down a way back , and we walked for miles .
we saw your bus and hopped on .
we didn &apos;t want to wake you at this hour .
broke down , eh ?
we didn &apos;t pass no wrecks on the highway .
the whole thing sounds like a pack of lies .
you see , we were off on a side road . I know .
a moonlight night and a parked car . that &apos;s nice .
Oh , no , really , we were just ...
Esmeralda ! everywhere you search for sex .
get your eyes out of the mud and look up at the stars .
Oh , I beg your pardon .
my name is Bones . I am also known as the human skeleton . how do you do ?
and this is Esmeralda , our bearded lady .
naturally , we &apos;re very proud to have her as a member of our group .
you poor kids must be tired .
come on in and sit down , have a little rest .
we &apos;re trying to get to a place called Soda City , a couple of hundred miles north , I think .
well , then , you won &apos;t get there till morning , so make yourselves comfortable .
you must meet our other co-worker ,
Tatania , our little human mountain .
a very great lady , indeed . how do you do ?
what goes on there ?
Oh , did we wake you , honey ?
that &apos;s too bad . Oh , I was awake .
I wish you &apos;d tell Mignonette to do something about that insomnia of hers .
I &apos;ve been tossing and turning all night .
I wish you &apos;d tell Marigold to shut her silly old face .
are you girls not speaking to each other again ? dear , dear .
Marigold &apos;s mad because I got her beau away from her back in the last town we played .
kindly tell Mignonette I heard that last remark , that I wouldn &apos;t have the gentleman in question as a gift .
nothing but a common novelty-seeker .
girls , girls ! what will our guests think ?
Hey , he &apos;s cute !
you hear that ? there she goes again .
stop your squabbling .
they are tired . they &apos;ve been walking for miles !
nobody gave you a lift ?
I know .
the normal are normally cold-hearted .
stop gabbing and get these tramps off !
a cold heart , partly reduced in size .
I won &apos;t take no insults .
get them off . Aw , Major , honey ... Don &apos;t &quot; honey &quot; me !
I &apos;ve got a contract .
it provides for safe transportation , and it don &apos;t say nothing about picking up hobos . that &apos;s the police , all right .
they must be looking for somebody .
who could they want ?
me , I guess .
Oh ! the carefree youth , and he has handcuffs on .
what do they want you for ?
for something somebody else did .
I don &apos;t believe he &apos;s done anything wrong !
I &apos;ll go to bat for him anytime .
I &apos;ve always told Mignonette she &apos;d get mixed up with the police if she wasn &apos;t careful .
they &apos;re starting to search at the front .
well , what are you waiting for ? hand him over to the police .
he &apos;s perfectly right .
he &apos;s a little stinker .
seems like a terrible thing to do , but it &apos;d be terrible , too , if we got into trouble ...
all right , Bones , call the cops !
just a minute , Major .
in this situation , I find a parallel for the present world predicament .
we stand defeated at the outset .
you , Esmeralda , have sympathy , and yet you &apos;re willing to remain passive and let the inevitable happen .
I have a belief , and yet I &apos;m tempted to let myself be over-ridden by force .
the rest of you , with the exception of this malignant jerk , are ignorant of the facts , and , therefore , confused .
thank heaven we &apos;re still members of a democracy .
we &apos;ll put the matter to a vote . no vote .
I &apos;m against voting !
Fascist !
you know how we stand so far .
the twins , as usual , are on opposite sides , and so their votes pair .
Tatania &apos;s on both sides at once and therefore neutral .
the Major is for delivering these young people to the police , and I , frankly , am against it .
Esmeralda , the decision is up to you .
well , I don &apos;t want any trouble any more than anybody else , but while you &apos;ve been talking , I &apos;ve been looking at something , something pretty fine , too .
I &apos;ve been looking at that little girl there standing right beside that poor young man .
never a word . never a question .
taking everything he &apos;s had to take , stringing along with him , whatever happens .
and I &apos;ve been thinking , it &apos;s the good people that stick when anybody &apos;s in trouble , and there aren &apos;t many good people in the world .
I think that we , all of us , know that better than most .
and , well , it isn &apos;t something you see every day of the week , so I vote ...
we don &apos;t give them up .
good girl , Esmeralda .
this is subversive ! I won &apos;t stand for it !
Oh , no , you don &apos;t , cuddles ! you &apos;ll abide by the will of the majority .
back into your places and pretend to be asleep .
that &apos;s all you have to do . here , honey , you sit right down here .
come on , young man , we &apos;ve got to hide you . turn all the lights off .
here . take off your coat and put this on .
come on . wake up in there ! Hey , what is this ?
Halloween ? police .
Oh , is that so ?
haven &apos;t you got anything better to do than waking up law-abiding citizens in the middle of the night ?
we &apos;re looking for a young man and his woman companion .
he &apos;s got dark hair , between the age of 20 and 25 .
the dame &apos;s supposed to be good-looking . have you seen them ?
now , where would I see anybody as normal as that ?
who &apos;s this ? doesn &apos;t look like one of your troop .
sure , she &apos;s one of us .
she &apos;s our little snake charmer .
right now she &apos;s sitting on a box of snakes so they don &apos;t get lonesome .
can you imagine that ? and a good-looking gal , too .
well , I guess you can all go back to sleep now .
a snake charmer ! well , well . you never can tell about women .
it &apos;s all right . you can come out now .
wait , justice , come back ! sit down here !
we &apos;re on our way .
I don &apos;t know how I can thank you , sir .
it &apos;s all right , my boy .
it gives you a good feeling when you can help somebody .
you people have a right to know what this is all about . it &apos;s all right , son .
if that little girl of yours can trust you , I guess we can . the baby !
she &apos;s had a tough time . poor little girl .
she &apos;s worn out .
I &apos;ll take care of her .
come on . let &apos;s go .
better let the snakes get some sleep .
they have to look good tomorrow .
I &apos;m sorry . what for ?
for being such a dope .
I was scared .
you &apos;d have been a dope if you hadn &apos;t been scared .
you &apos;re tired , that &apos;s all that &apos;s the matter with you . get some sleep .
you &apos;ll be fine .
I can go to sleep , all right .
I &apos;m so tired .
I want to tell you something .
I believe you .
do you , Pat ?
you didn &apos;t , you know .
it &apos;s a free country .
a girl can change her mind , can &apos;t she ? sure , she can .
thank you , Pat .
they made me so ashamed .
they &apos;re so nice and trusting .
they &apos;re wonderful people , all except that nasty little Major and the mean twin .
I don &apos;t suppose you can really blame the fat lady though , when a woman has lost her figure that way .
welcome to Soda City .
the heart of the bicarbonate belt .
well , we might as well do the town .
there &apos;s nothing here . come on .
I suppose we are a little late .
I &apos;m sorry , darling . I knew I shouldn &apos;t have brought you here .
I &apos;m not complaining .
this is great , isn &apos;t it ?
solution to all my problems .
I was counting on this place .
a dump like this , 5,000 miles from nowhere .
look at this . it &apos;s been in use .
let &apos;s go around to the window .
careful ! don &apos;t cut yourself .
Hello ? Hello ? hung up .
what sort of phone is that ?
it &apos;s a field telephone .
well , a room with a view .
what do you suppose they cut that for ?
I don &apos;t know .
say , look . tripod .
looks like it &apos;s the right height . Yeah .
something else goes with this .
there !
that &apos;s it .
see anything ?
not yet . Uh-oh .
let me see !
why , that &apos;s a ...
we better put this away . take that .
the wood .
what about it ?
they wouldn &apos;t burn that in a stove .
why not ?
the smoke would show .
that &apos;s a car . you better hide .
no , not here .
what do you think you &apos;re doing around here ?
Hiya . I was wondering when you &apos;d get here .
where are you from ? what are you sniffing around here for ? excuse me .
funny , you knowing about this place . I don &apos;t quite get it .
you might have thought it over more carefully .
your coming here doesn &apos;t help us a bit .
the heat &apos;s on this guy and he shows up here .
Tobin sent me .
the old man must be off his nut sending him up here . be a little more careful , Neilson .
your criticisms in front of other people . Yeah .
don &apos;t talk that way about the old guy .
I &apos;ll watch out for myself , Doc . me , too .
don &apos;t forget about me . that &apos;s why Tobin sent me up here .
he said you &apos;d know how to take care of me . I guess that makes it pretty clear , Neilson .
I don &apos;t know .
a guy walks in out of the desert , and right away I get orders .
it ain &apos;t so clear to me .
I &apos;m a little better than a stranger , friend , if you &apos;ll remember my press clippings . Yes .
Mr. Kane has done pretty well down South .
his accomplishments can &apos;t be disregarded , at least I hope not .
a man that has served as well as he has is entitled at least to recognition .
I &apos;m entitled to more than that . protection , too . you guys have got to take care of me .
I &apos;m sure the firm will do its best .
they &apos;re known to be quite loyal to their employees .
Neilson will see to it that the firm &apos;s record is maintained .
you got it easy , you guys from back East .
you give orders . you do that , all right .
the big boys with the desk jobs .
all you got to do is reach for a telephone , sit back in a big leather chair , and us guys out here have got to take the rap .
you know , I think I &apos;ll go back East and work for a while .
you &apos;re not a very good example of loyalty to the firm . Yeah ?
well , I &apos;m getting just a little bit tired , see .
so am I ! I &apos;m getting tired of all this talk . let &apos;s get going !
the trip up here was no pushover .
I had to hoof it most of the way .
I got no place to hide you out . that ain &apos;t my line .
that ain &apos;t your line , huh ? what about you ?
you don &apos;t seem so interested , either !
or I suppose you &apos;re just the big brains !
or maybe you take a chance now and then just for laughs . or maybe it doesn &apos;t work that way .
maybe I &apos;m the only guy that sticks his neck out .
well , get this , both of you !
I pulled a big job and they &apos;re after me .
and you guys are gonna take care of me and do it right , or you &apos;re gonna have trouble on your hands .
I &apos;ve got to get out of this part of the country !
the ground &apos;s burning up under my feet !
I &apos;ve got to get back East !
it &apos;s a little more crowded back there . a guy doesn &apos;t stand out like he does here .
Hey , take it easy . hang on to your nerve .
I &apos;ve been hanging on to my nerves ! I &apos;ve been hanging on long enough !
I understand your difficulties . I &apos;m sorry about all the talk .
but in this business , we always have to make sure .
I think I know him now .
I &apos;m driving back East , you know . you &apos;d better come with me .
all right , let &apos;s get going .
get all the things together . after we leave , I want this place cleaned up .
you won &apos;t be coming back here .
why not ? you think they got the place spotted ?
I &apos;m making sure .
you &apos;ll have to find another place and store all this stuff .
well , it &apos;s not gonna be easy . it &apos;s your job .
if you can &apos;t handle it , I &apos;ll have to get someone else .
all right .
I &apos;ll handle it .
you &apos;ll need some clothes .
size 42 . what &apos;ll we do about these ? Hmm .
how did you manage to break them ?
on an automobile fan .
that &apos;s very bright of you .
I think we can even take care of that , but let &apos;s get started now . did you hear something ?
where does that lead to ?
just another room . the way out .
you see , we figure that Kane and the other fellows are probably heading for New York .
if there &apos;s anything I can do ...
we sure appreciate that .
why , anyone would have done the same thing .
that &apos;s right , this war sure makes a difference .
everybody wants to get in and pitch .
now , if you &apos;ll just give me your address in New York , Miss Martin , we can contact you back there .
or maybe you could wire me about which plane you &apos;re taking .
we may want to get a hold of you fast .
well , I can do that when I get back to my uncle .
okay , Miss Martin , just keep in touch . I &apos;m glad we came this way .
it adds a few miles to our trip , but somehow I &apos;ve become a little sentimental .
I want to take a last look at it . beautiful , isn &apos;t it ?
a great monument to man &apos;s unceasing industry and his stubborn faith in the future .
you &apos;ll be moving along soon .
are you carrying any cameras or firearms at all ?
nothing at all , Officer .
you , sir ? no , sir .
they must get a lot of power from this dam .
I think it supplies about 75 % for the Los Angeles district , naturally including most of the power for the defense plants there .
well , do you think there &apos;s any ... Do you know Tobin very well ?
no , not very well . I met him just that once at his ranch .
did he have the child with him ? his grandchild ?
Yes . he seemed to be very fond of her .
that &apos;s one of the things I like about old Tobin , his love for that little girl .
evidence of a good heart . I have children , too , you know .
Oh ? two boys . nice little fellows .
the four-year-old is naughty at times . he &apos;s quite a problem .
we get him a new toy and within half an hour it &apos;s smashed to bits .
and then , sometimes , after it &apos;s all over , he seems almost sorry .
sometimes I wish my younger child had been a girl .
in fact , my wife and I often argue over a little idiosyncrasy I have .
I don &apos;t want his hair cut short until he &apos;s much older .
do you think it &apos;d be bad for him ? well , I don &apos;t know , it might be .
when I was a child , I had long golden curls .
people used to stop on the street to admire me .
things are different nowadays . if you gave the kid a haircut , it might save him a lot of grief .
Ah , we &apos;re on our way .

♪ While the moon

drive to 401 instead of the office . okay .
anything wrong ?
plenty . I &apos;ve just called the office .
they &apos;ve disconnected the phone .
same old phone company . should have paid the bill .
this is no time for jokes .
the police . they &apos;re watching the office .
the disconnected phone , it &apos;s our signal .
you think they &apos;re watching for me ?
I don &apos;t know . who &apos;d know you were in New York ? Oh , yeah .
I guess you &apos;re right .
how about Brooklyn tomorrow ? do you want me on the job ?
when are you going to learn to keep your mouth shut ?
sorry . I thought he was in on it .
shut up !
it &apos;s all right . I &apos;m good at keeping secrets .
let &apos;s go .
good evening , Mr. Freeman .
Hi , Mr. Freeman . Hello .
Ah , pleased to see you , Mr. Freeman . have a good trip ? Yes .
thank you , Robert .
madam is upstairs . she &apos;s waiting anxiously for you .
Oh , thank you , Robert . we &apos;ll go right up . this way .
who &apos;s that ?
Hey , is this a hotel ? what &apos;s the festivity ?
it &apos;s for a very worthy cause .
Mrs. Sutton often gives her house over to charity affairs .
she &apos;s a very generous woman .
I have an idea she isn &apos;t going to be really pleased to see us on a night like this .
idiots , all of you . stupid , inefficient idiots .
everything is left to me .
I have to hover over all of you like an old hen .
I &apos;m sorry , Mrs. Sutton .
the guests downstairs expect me to put in an appearance .
after all , as you say , they want something for their $ 25 !
I will not have my benevolence abused .
my life , my position , they &apos;re important to me .
I &apos;ll do my best , Mrs. Sutton .
I only wish your best were a little better . Oh .
Mr. Freeman , I &apos;m glad you &apos;ve come at this time .
I was just telling Edward ... Is this the young man ?
must you bring him here , as well ? I certainly can &apos;t furnish him with sanctuary .
this house is full of guests , important people !
don &apos;t you understand my position , Mr. Freeman , with this young man here ?
the police are already watching your office .
thank goodness they &apos;ll never come here .
but a little more of your stupid behavior and even the respectability of my house won &apos;t shield you .
I &apos;m sorry , Mrs. Sutton . we can &apos;t leave any loose ends .
all right !
all right ! but for heaven &apos;s sake , stop playing the conspirator .
now tell me all you know about the girl or ask him .
why didn &apos;t you tell me about the young lady back in Soda City ?
Oh . well , I didn &apos;t think it was important .
she was just a girl , like anybody else .
she picked me up , she was pretty .
I guess it was kind of risky . well , there you are .
I &apos;m so sorry to have exposed you to any risk .
what &apos;s she doing here ?
you &apos;re surprised to see me again .
how did you get here ?
it doesn &apos;t matter how she got here .
the point is there was no reason to bring her here at all !
you see , Mr. Kane ,
I just learned on the telephone at the gas station that she was most indiscreet after she left you at Soda City .
she went straight to the local sheriff , who , fortunately , happened to be a particularly good friend of ours .
Oh , don &apos;t waste time in explanations , Mr. Freeman .
you &apos;ve got to get the girl out of this house , all of you .
I will not have my benevolence abused !
so you played smart . that &apos;s great . that &apos;s a big help to all of us .
no , I wasn &apos;t smart at all .
I haven &apos;t been smart for four days .
even when I went to the sheriff I hesitated .
I hated to do anything that might get you into trouble .
Yeah , I sympathize . the mistake I made was not leaving you back there with the snakes !
you might have at least learned to rattle .
I was right about you in the first place .
good evening , Mr. Kane .
I didn &apos;t know you were a bookworm .
you must let me choose something appropriate for you .
something not too difficult for you to understand .
let me see .
here we are .
this will do admirably . remarkable work .
somehow prophetic . why are you here , Charles ?
and what &apos;s all this nonsense about books ?
I am a refugee .
I have at last joined that revolting group of world travelers .
one ultimately turns into the thing one despises most .
and whom have I to thank for it ? you , Mr. Freeman .
the girl was allowed to escape unobserved .
she left Mr. Kane , went straight to her uncle .
and that charming old man went to the police .
as a result , a whole hoard of officers came to my house .
luckily , I was leaving when they arrived .
and the others , the very loyal ones , well , they &apos;re paying for their loyalty .
how appalling ! your charming house .
I &apos;m so sorry , Charles . it &apos;s rather lucky . you might have been sorrier .
and you might have been a little more efficient in this whole matter , Mr. Freeman !
what good is it going to do you to insult me ?
we &apos;re in trouble now .
and so the most important thing is to make sure of everyone around us .
of Mr. Kane ? I &apos;m just not sure .
I want to know that he &apos;s all right .
all right ? what an understatement . he &apos;s much more than that !
he &apos;s noble and fine and pure .
and so he pays the penalty that the noble and the fine and the pure must pay in this world .
he &apos;s misjudged by everyone .
why , even the police have a completely erroneous impression of him .
I can assure you that contrary to what is supposed and to what he may himself have told you , that young man is certainly not one of his country &apos;s enemies .
Charles , you &apos;re joking !
I mean exactly what I say .
Mr. Kane is definitely no part of our little organization .
your protégé . well , you &apos;ve done splendidly .
you bring him here , you idiot .
now what in heaven &apos;s name are we going to do with him ?
that &apos;s a very appropriate question .
not much we can do with him .
I made the mistake once of turning him over to the police .
that &apos;s even more impossible at the moment .
I &apos;m afraid there &apos;s only one thing we can do .
you see , the new law threatens all of us with the death penalty .
so , I &apos;m afraid we &apos;ll have to apply the ancient axiom .
tooth for a tooth .
Kane for a Tobin .
please don &apos;t discuss things of that sort here .
it &apos;s rather nauseating and quite out of place . Oh , Charles , I &apos;m frightened .
we must take all precaution .
of course . we must also continue with our work .
it &apos;s too risky now . we &apos;re already abandoning the dam .
we must remain inactive for a while .
inactive ? you are utterly mistaken .
once we do that , our organization is finished .
we must carry on at all costs .
what about tomorrow &apos;s work ?
tomorrow &apos;s work ? you can &apos;t abandon that after all your preparations .
but , Charles , the risk ... Is great . I know that .
unfortunately , we will have to carry out our orders .
I am leaving for the Caribbean now .
my position here is more impossible than all of yours .
of course I &apos;m rather looking forward to Central America .
Havana will be very gay this season .
you know , somehow I &apos;ve suddenly had enough of this country .
the war has made it grim .
you &apos;re leaving us here to face everything , and you &apos;ll be on a boat sailing along .
it all sounds idyllic .
Oh , Charles , Charles , this whole thing , it &apos;s impossible .
it &apos;s panicky . I &apos;m deeply sorry .
there you are , darling !
how unbecoming for a hostess to hide herself away . am I intruding ?
I am so sorry , but I just must kidnap Henrietta .
she &apos;ll be back .
I &apos;ve had some trouble with these people . they &apos;re doing the catering and making rather a horrid mess of it .
our boy will appear any minute with the caviar !
I assure you . I &apos;ll stake my reputation on it .
don &apos;t be a fool ! get to the house phone .
how &apos;d you get here ? they met me at the airport .
I thought they were the police , then they brought me here .
wait a minute . no use trying the way I came in .
let &apos;s walk right out through the front door ! might as well . Yes , sir .
we &apos;ll watch the back exit . they won &apos;t get out .
no good . see the one on the other side ? I met him on the way in .
he &apos;s one of them . we &apos;ll never get out that way .
what can they do to us ?
plenty . they &apos;d grab us . we wouldn &apos;t have a chance .
but these people would see them do it . of course .
and if anyone had a question , we &apos;re a couple of gatecrashers .
Barry , this is awful . it &apos;s like a bad dream .
all these people here .
isn &apos;t there anyone we can trust ?
sure there is . all of them . only which one ?
excuse me . this may sound sort of crazy .
in fact , I don &apos;t even know how to start .
but this whole house is a hotbed of spies and saboteurs .
I &apos;m not being silly . I assure you . even our hostess , Mrs. Sutton .
what &apos;s the matter with you , sir ? you &apos;re drunk ! you &apos;re not even dressed .
what &apos;d he say ?
Oh , he thinks I &apos;m drunk .
when I read in the papers what those Japs are doing ...
beat it out ! beat it out . keep it natural .
Yeah , man . stay in that pitch .
pardon me . did you pay $ 25 to get in here tonight ?
no , not exactly . my boss gave me a ticket . why ?
I need your help very badly .
we &apos;re in the middle of the biggest bunch of fifth columnists in the country .
are you kidding ? what &apos;s the gag ? no , I &apos;m on the level .
this is it . Aw , you &apos;re kidding .
we got a wag on the joint .
the guy &apos;s trying to rib me . Aw , sling him your curve . beat it out , son .
excuse me , sir . I &apos;d like to talk to you about something very important .
what is it , Mr. Kane ? you know it &apos;s hopeless .
why don &apos;t you join Mr. Tobin upstairs for a little supper ?
I &apos;ll show you the way .
Barry , before they get to us , go out and stop the music and tell them !
honey , this is the Sutton mansion .
I &apos;m just a guy from Glendale , California , wanted by the police .
they &apos;ll grab me as soon as I open my mouth . what are you gonna do ?
we can &apos;t just stand here .
I know where we &apos;ll be safe .
Barry , I &apos;m scared .
it &apos;s so unreal , all these people dancing and having a good time .
Yeah . and when you try to warn them , they laugh at you .
they think you &apos;re drunk .
that gray-haired man you spoke to , he seemed like such an honest citizen . Hmm .
just a friend of the family .
I guess the room &apos;s well sprinkled with them .
they &apos;re so smart . that &apos;s what frightens me .
Yeah , they &apos;re smart , that &apos;s because they &apos;re ruthless .
it &apos;s easy to win when you forget about the rules .
a man named Fry drops a wallet in California and we wind up here , you and me .
that &apos;s the only good part of it , I &apos;m with you .
I wish it were somewhere else . the North Pole , I wouldn &apos;t care .
we might wind up there yet , too , chasing Fry over the old glacier !
Fry . he seems so small now . I &apos;d forgotten about him .
so had I .
well , we can &apos;t just go on dancing like it &apos;s Saturday night at The Palladium .
we can &apos;t just wait till they come and get us .
what do you think they &apos;ll really do ?
Oh , right now they &apos;re probably haggling over the price with Murder Incorporated .
Oh , Barry , please !
sorry , Pat .
I hate to be out of it now there &apos;s still so much to do .
if ever there was a time when staying alive was important , you heard what they said .
something about a job they are going to do tomorrow in Brooklyn .
the Navy Yard . one of us has got to get out of here .
maybe if I start something , you can make a break for it .
well , what about you ?
you can &apos;t worry about me . we got to take a chance .
Oh , Barry , why couldn &apos;t I have met you 100 years ago on a beach somewhere ?
bathing suits looked awfully funny 100 years ago .
I &apos;ll bet you &apos;d look beautiful , though .
afraid we &apos;re not behaving very well .
what &apos;s the difference ?
we weren &apos;t invited anyway .
Pat , this moment belongs to me .
no matter what happens , they can never take it away from me . Oh , pardon me .
do you mind ?
Oh , excuse me . would you care to dance ?
why , yes . certainly .
Oh , you &apos;re really a much better dancer .
thanks . who was the man you were dancing with ?
I have no idea . I never saw him before .
no , I mean the man that just left you .
I know . that &apos;s who I &apos;m talking about .
I never saw him before in my life .
Oh , what a pity . that was lovely . I hope you will ask me again .
Oh , thanks . thanks a lot .
well , young man , you seem to be enjoying yourself .
charming party , isn &apos;t it ?
where is she ?
you mean your young lady ? I thought you were taking care of her .
perhaps she has a headache and lying down somewhere .
would you like to come with me and look for her ?
hold on .
ladies and gentlemen . ladies and gentlemen !
your attention , please .
I have something to tell you .
something you ought to know about this house and about your hostess .
I beg your pardon , sir , but before you go on ,
I think you might like to take a look at the curtain on the balcony .
I &apos;m not much of a public speaker , ladies and gentlemen , and some of you are probably wondering how I can tell you anything about your hostess that you don &apos;t already know .
her graciousness , her kindness , her many charities .
well , I want to tell you that you have a big surprise coming , ladies and gentlemen .
tonight , in this house , for the benefit of this great cause for which she &apos;s already done so much , our hostess , Mrs. Sutton , is putting up for auction one of her most treasured possessions , one of the famous Sutton jewels .
Mrs. Sutton , would you kindly step forward ?
thank you .
Mr. Kane , the young lady is asking to see you .
are you sure ? I wouldn &apos;t keep her waiting if I were you , sir .
Yes .
will someone please ...
admiral , how about you ? would you take over for me , please ? excuse me , please .
delighted , sir . thank you . ladies and gentlemen ,
I will entertain your bids for this beautiful bracelet , which has been donated by our hostess , Mrs. Sutton .
what am I bid ? $ 1,000 .
$ 1,000 has been bid .
do I hear any more ? $ 1,500 .
$ 1,500 has been bid .
do I hear ?
$ 1,750 .
$ 2,000 . $ 2,000 has been bid for this beautiful bracelet .
where is she ?
you seem to have a soft spot for that young lady .
you can &apos;t afford to make yourself that vulnerable , not when you &apos;re out trying to save your country .
why is it that you sneer every time you refer to this country ? you &apos;ve done pretty well here .
I don &apos;t get it . no , you wouldn &apos;t .
you &apos;re one of the ardent believers , the good American . Oh , there are millions like you .
people that plod along without asking questions .
I hate to use the word stupid , but it seems to be the only one that applies .
the great masses , the moron millions .
well , there are a few of us who are unwilling to just troop along .
a few of us who are clever enough to see that there &apos;s much more to be done than just live small , complacent lives .
a few of us in America who desire a more profitable type of government .
when you think about it , Mr. Kane , the competence of totalitarian nations is much higher than ours .
they get things done .
Yeah . they get things done .
they bomb cities , sink ships , torture and murder , so you and your friends can eat off a gold plate .
it &apos;s a great philosophy . I neither intend to be bombed nor sunk , Mr. Kane .
that &apos;s why I &apos;m leaving now .
and if things don &apos;t go right for you , if we should win , then I &apos;ll come back .
perhaps I can get what I want then , power .
I want that as much as you want your comfort , or your job , or that girl .
we all have different tastes , as you can see .
only I &apos;m willing to back my tastes with the necessary force .
you certainly make it sound smooth and easy . well , that &apos;s a trick .
I know the results of that power you believe in .
it killed my friend , and it &apos;s killing thousands like him .
that &apos;s what you &apos;re aiming at .
but it doesn &apos;t bother you , I can see that .
because you really hate all people .
let me tell you something .
the last four , five days I &apos;ve learned a lot .
I &apos;ve met guys like you and I &apos;ve met others , people that are helpful and eager to do the right thing , people that get a kick out of helping each other fight the bad guys .
love and hate .
the world &apos;s choosing up sides . I know who I &apos;m with .
and there are a lot of people on my side , millions of us in every country .
and we &apos;re not soft .
we &apos;re plenty strong . and we &apos;ll fight standing up on our two feet , and we &apos;ll win .
remember that , Mr. Tobin .
we &apos;ll win , no matter what you guys do .
we &apos;ll win if it takes from now until the cows come home .
Mr. Kane , I think we &apos;ve discussed the rights of man sufficiently .
I &apos;m feeling a little tired . you must be , too .
Robert , do you think you can arrange for Mr. Kane to sleep somewhere tonight ?
Yes , sir . certainly , sir .
that &apos;s enough , Robert .
very good , sir .
think you can take care of this ? Yes , sir .
will that be all , sir ? Yes , thank you .
it doesn &apos;t matter what arrangements we &apos;ve made , to what trouble we &apos;ve gone .
this whole job hangs on one thing , timing .
if the section of the slipway goes up before the actual moment of launching , then all our efforts have been wasted .
if you blow her too late , well , then you just scare the crowd .
timing , timing , timing .
that button must not be pressed until the ship starts to move .
what arrangements have been made for getting out of there ?
as soon as the camera cables are unhooked , this truck goes .
we got a fix at the gate to get through without failing .
who &apos;s handling the camera near the slipway ?
I am .
the wires to the explosives were laid last night . all I have to do is hook them up to the camera .
too bad we have to lose a good camera .
well , everything seems to be taken care of .
I &apos;ll be waiting for you at the newsreel office . good luck .
have they gone ? Yes .
how is she ?
okay . she &apos;s having her breakfast .
any trouble keeping her quiet ?
no . I made a deal with her .
you see , she got tired of having that adhesive tape over her eyes and mouth .
well , I hope we get rid of her soon .
I promised to take my kid sister to the Philharmonic .
give me the key . there it is .
I &apos;m sorry we couldn &apos;t keep you at the house last night , but Mrs. Sutton has a limited number of guest rooms , and I suppose Mr. Kane was first in line .
where am I ?
Oh , that &apos;s a trade secret .
I only hope it isn &apos;t too high for you here .
Mr. Kane &apos;s quarters are nearer the ground , but he &apos;s being well looked after , and , like you , is probably enjoying a hearty breakfast .
whose place is that ?
that &apos;s Mrs. Sutton &apos;s house .
Oh , who &apos;s she ?
some rich dame .
saw something in the paper about her doing things for charity .
right here somewhere . here .
what about tomorrow &apos;s work ? tomorrow &apos;s work ?
you can &apos;t abandon that after all your preparations .
but , Charles , the risk ... Is great . I know that .
unfortunately , we will have to carry out our orders .
what &apos;s the time ? 10 : 50 .
thanks .
Brooklyn Navy Yard , quick !
how much ? 15 .
got change ? Yes .
courtesy of the Navy Department , we are now able to take you to the Brooklyn Navy Yard , where over a national hook-up we will endeavor to bring you a description of the actual launching ceremony of the Navy &apos;s capital ship , the USS Alaska .
and so without further ado , we switch you now to the Brooklyn Navy Yard .
here we are at the Brooklyn Navy Yard .
it &apos;s rather a windy autumn day , but still it &apos;s a pretty good day for a launching .
I guess any day is a good day for a launching in these times .
our microphones are located in several key spots , so we &apos;ll be able to bring you ...
what &apos;s holding us up ?
traffic , buddy . what do you think ?
here . I &apos;ll walk . okay .
well , I guess the main speaker is about to begin .
ladies and gentlemen , I am now turning you over to Bill Donnan , who is located on the actual platform . go ahead , Bill .
this is Bill Donnan , ladies and gentlemen .
we &apos;re located up here on the platform , right below the bow of the great ship .
it towers over us like some enormous monster .
this platform on which we have ... Take me to the guy in charge !
okay .
I &apos;ll take care of this . what do you want ?
something &apos;s gonna happen at the launching , sabotage .
where &apos;d you get your information ?
I can &apos;t say now . there isn &apos;t time .
what can I do ? we got to have a little more than that to go on .
better come in the office and talk to the chief . I tell you there isn &apos;t time !
what do you expect me to do ?
take me to the guy in charge of the launching .
no , you got to go through the office first .
that &apos;s all . Towley , 1050 .
very crowded at the moment with all kinds of Navy officers ... Wait here .
... and Navy personnel . I can see in the group to my left Rear Admiral Pierce and Mrs. Pierce .
it is Mrs. Pierce who will perform the actual bottle breaking today .
she is shaking hands with a great many people down there right now .
just a second , ladies and gentlemen .
I see Rear Admiral Pierce moving toward the microphone .
Yes . I think he &apos;s going to begin his speech now .
we &apos;ll switch you over to the speaker &apos;s microphone .
the launching of a ship in a time of war is always a solemn occasion .
today , when our fleet is fighting on all the seven seas , this ceremony gains magnitude for it represents , for the American people , a victory .
where &apos;d that guy go ? I don &apos;t know .
he just stepped outside .
... by the strong , diligent of hands of American workmen .
let us rejoice , then , at this moment .
let us be confident working for this great country to show the world what America can do .
our American soldiers , who are freely giving their lives , so that we in this country can live in decency , security and peace .
this is Bill Donnan again , ladies and gentlemen .
you &apos;ve just heard Rear Admiral Pierce speaking from the Brooklyn Navy Yard . his speech is being received with great applause ...
lock the back doors , quick !
I can handle this ! be ready to pull out as soon as she goes .
the naval officer is handing her a bottle of champagne that is tied somewhere above it .
the crowd is tense . it is indeed a solemn occasion .
I switch you over to our microphone near the bow of the ship so that you may hear the actual launching .
now I can see that Mrs. Pierce is moving towards the bow of the ship .
I &apos;ll switch you over now to Mrs. Pierce .
in the name of the people of the United States ,
I christen thee Alaska .
what &apos;s the trouble ?
don &apos;t know . an explosion somewhere .
George !
everything okay ?
no , give us a hand . we got a guy .
better scatter . go down the corridor and through the iron door .
it will take you to the music hall . we &apos;ll go this way .
you must go , go at once , before Henry catches you here .
see here , I thought you wanted to make the old boy jealous . not anymore .
he &apos;s threatened to kill you on sight .
Oh , I say , you don &apos;t think he &apos;d go that far , do you ?
of course he will .
Oh , will you go before it &apos;s too late , before he shoots you to death ?
see here , are you trying to tell me Old Henry &apos;s got a gun , a real gun ?
Oh ! what do you think this is ?
I &apos;ve caught you at last , you rat in the grass !
stop that ! run , Wilbur , run ! before he gets your range !
I think I got it now . get out before I shoot again !
run , Wilbur , run !
quick ! it never touched me !
I &apos;ll get you this time . my husband !
he &apos;s shot !
I &apos;ll kill the rat if it &apos;s the last thing I do !
he was only kidding .
get out of here ! get out of here !
he &apos;s gone mad ! mad ! go on .
get out ! not that way ! he &apos;ll kill you !
stop him ! help !
murder ! help ! run , for heaven &apos;s sake !
there he goes ! he &apos;s the one you &apos;re after .
you &apos;re the one we &apos;re after .
come on ! I tell you , he &apos;s the one .
he &apos;ll get away ! come on ! Pat , grab a cab and go after him and don &apos;t lose him .
downtown . whereabouts ?
anywhere . just keep going downtown .
may I have change for the telephone , please ? Yes , ma &apos;am .
operator ? give me the FBI headquarters , please .
federal Bureau of Investigation . hold on , I &apos;ll put you through .
make sure he doesn &apos;t leave by the next boat .
talk to him , follow him .
do your best to keep him there until our men come along .
a girl says she thinks she &apos;s traced Fry to Bedloe Island .
she &apos;s crazy . he &apos;d never go there .
where did you pick up Schultz last month ?
in that museum , that modern art place . and Renaldo ?
you caught him looking at the fish in the aquarium , didn &apos;t you ?
Yeah , but the statue &apos;s a dead end .
that &apos;s why he &apos;s smart .
you better get going .
let me take him along in any case , just to make sure the girl hasn &apos;t made a mistake .
burke , you &apos;re one of the most obstinate men I &apos;ve ever met ! get going . come on .
pardon me . could you tell me which is Brooklyn ?
I &apos;ve seen you before , haven &apos;t I ?
sure .
on that boat coming over .
what &apos;d you ask me ?
about Brooklyn , I was wondering where it was . I &apos;ve heard so much about it .
over there .
where are you from ? new York .
what are you handing me ?
Oh , no . you see , I work in a store downtown .
now , I never get a chance to get out .
I just sit around all day , and I never see anything .
so I said to myself , the first vacation I get ,
I &apos;m going to see the Statue of Liberty .
this must be a big moment for you , huh ?
Oh , it is . and it means so much to us now .
why , I was just reading here in this booklet .
did you know this statue was given to us by the French ?
do you know what they had written on it ?
&quot; give me your tired , your poor , your huddled masses ,
&quot; yearning to breathe free ,
&quot; the wretched refuse of your teeming shore .
&quot; send these , the homeless , tempest-tossed to me . &quot;
and just look at the French . isn &apos;t it sad ?
Yeah . very sad .
Oh , it &apos;s such a beautiful statue .
I could just sit up here all day thinking about it . couldn &apos;t you ?
some other day , maybe . not right now .
right now I got to catch that boat back . you coming ?
well , there &apos;s another boat in 15 minutes .
couldn &apos;t we wait ?
all the people have gone , and we &apos;d be alone , just you and me . sounds cozy .
but I ... I haven &apos;t got the time .
Oh , on a nice autumn day like this , you couldn &apos;t spare 15 minutes for me ?
I don &apos;t like autumn .
you &apos;re not being very nice to a lonely girl .
you look as though you might be lonely , too . Yeah .
I got to catch that boat .
fifteen minutes shouldn &apos;t make such a big difference , Mr. Fry .
who are you ?
come on . quit stalling . who are you ?
I think I told you . a working girl on her day off .
don &apos;t kid me !
what are you doing here ?
it &apos;s rather a long story , Mr. Fry .
it all started with an unknown blonde , an aircraft worker at a factory in Glendale , California .
I get it .
little Miss Liberty , carrying the torch . why &apos;d you follow me ?
why do you think ? take a look down there .
if you can &apos;t figure it out for yourself , they &apos;re coming for you .
do you see him in this bunch ? no . Barnes , you stay here and watch this end .
the rest of you fellows , come with me .
you two , watch that side .
I &apos;m going up .
Pat , where is he ? he started down !
are you sure ?
Yeah .
he &apos;s up here ! come on !
come on , Fry !
I &apos;ll get your sleeve .
don &apos;t you go over .
if you slip , that will be three gone . quick ! get a rope .
can you get a grip with your feet ? I can &apos;t .
Kane , I &apos;m getting a rope !
they &apos;re getting a rope . hold on , Fry .
I &apos;ll clear you . I swear I will .
I &apos;ll clear you .
hurry up with the rope !
tell them quick . the sleeve . sleeve !
Kane !
Hey , you in or aren &apos;t ya ?
get out !
get out !
keep your dirty hands off me .
Ah !
you !
you and your cat !
go on , beat it .
look at my dress .
you oughta buy me a new one .
beat it , I said !
Cheapskate !
Hello , mister .
Albert Baker ?
Yes ?
come in , friend .
come in .
don &apos;t worry .
my secretary .
you &apos;ve , uh , brought the money ?
we &apos;re having coffee .
try a cookie .
they &apos;re very good .
it &apos;s lucky they sent you today .
by tonight , this would &apos;ve been on its way to Washington .
that would &apos;ve been just too bad for your boss , wouldn &apos;t it ?
especially the little , uh , prescription ?
I &apos;m even willing to forgive your boss that nasty little word &quot; blackmail . &quot;
so then , here you are and ...
the money , please .
they said he &apos;d be alone .
Hi , mister .
mister ?
I dropped my ball .
thanks .
it was very nicely handled , my boy .
I compliment you .
taught Mr. Baker a lesson in morality , didn &apos;t you ?
ugly people , blackmailers .
only one way to pay them off .
won &apos;t you have a sundae ?
I &apos;ll have my cut , Johnson .
I &apos;m broke .
here &apos;s your end .
no , I &apos;m not through with that .
Oh , lovely .
Dainty but sculptured .
I &apos;ll bet you read palms .
I &apos;m an expert .
how &apos;d you guess ?
I guessed .
Oh .
my client is most grateful .
he must have plenty of lettuce .
who is he ?
Oh , he &apos;s very shy .
I couldn &apos;t discuss him .
say , Johnson , what is your line , anyway ?
you &apos;re not a finger man .
I &apos;m shy too .
why , Mr. Gates !
my name is not Gates .
you mean , you &apos;re not Will Gates of Los Angeles ?
I &apos;m not .
I &apos;m sorry .
so annoying .
second time today .
peppermint ?
they &apos;re all 10s .
you didn &apos;t expect a thousand ones , did you ?
don &apos;t you trust me ?
who trusts anybody ?
direct from the bank , as I promised .
Oh , I see your point , of course .
if the bills were bad , you couldn &apos;t very well complain to the police , could you ?
I &apos;m my own police .
what do you mean ?
what would you do ?
first I &apos;d find out who you &apos;re stoogin &apos; for ... the shy boy .
then I &apos;d give him what I gave Baker .
don &apos;t ! I ...
I can &apos;t stand violence .
then I &apos;d whittle off a little of that blubber .
such a warped sense of humor .
Oh , I forgot .
a little gift from me .
orchestra seats to the best show in town .
I oughta know .
it cost me plenty .
that &apos;s my one vice ...
backing leg shows .
no , thanks .
go ahead , take your girl .
you ... must have a girl or a friend .
why ?
live alone , work alone , eh ?
Raven , how do you feel when you &apos;re doing ... this ?
I feel fine .
well ... be good .
Lieutenant Crane ?
Yeah ?
I &apos;m Willard Gates , Nitro Chemical Corporation of Los Angeles .
my firm wants to know what the police up here are doing , if anything , about the man who robbed our paymaster .
they &apos;re working on it .
he &apos;s been reported here in San Francisco .
don &apos;t they know that ?
Yes , of course they know it .
that &apos;s why I &apos;m on the case .
I &apos;m from the Los Angeles force , up here on my vacation until this happened .
well , I hope you can get some results .
it &apos;s been a week since the robbery .
the stolen bills are all new and all 10s .
why hasn &apos;t an arrest been made ?
I &apos;ll tell you why .
the man may not even be here .
all we can do is wait for him to pass one of those hot bills .
if he does that , we &apos;ve got him .
I hope so .
you know we &apos;re offering a reward ?
Yeah .
5,000 for a 20,000 bundle .
it &apos;s kind of unusual .
is it ?
well , it &apos;s just because ... the president of our company is so upset over it .
well , it &apos;s his dough .
remember we want him , dead or alive ... preferably the former after what he did to our paymaster .
and quickly , too , or we &apos;ll go higher up .
go milk a duck !
five thousand dollars .
Mmm .
I could buy myself a farm , get a couple chickens and lay my own eggs .
that &apos;s a neat trick if you can do it .
thanks .
all right , Miss Graham .
this is the gal .
have you ever seen the love lights
in a lady &apos;s eyes
and then suddenly watch it vanish away
if there &apos;s trouble in your love life
well , my friend get wise
for as we magicians would say
now you see it
now you don &apos;t
it goes hocus-pocus Alagazam
that &apos;s love
try to kiss her
first she won &apos;t
and then presto , chango fiddle-dee-dee
you &apos;re hand in glove
one moment she &apos;s making you see
Canaries in the air
next moment instead of her heart
the ace of spades is there
now you see it
now you don &apos;t
because hocus-pocus Lo and behold
you get blinded by that moon of bright gold above
that &apos;s love
now you see it
now you don &apos;t
because hocus-pocus Lo and behold
you get blinded by that moon of bright gold above
that &apos;s love
thank you , McGillicuddy .

Yes , very clever and very attractive .

your act is very charming .
thank you .
I wonder if we two might have dinner together tomorrow night in Los Angeles .
McGillicuddy ?
my manager says no .
I don &apos;t like your manager .
well , I don &apos;t always take his advice .
and people ask me why I back shows .
thank you , Mr. Fletcher , very much for digging her up .

we &apos;re late .
why don &apos;t you tell me what this is all about ?
talk takes time .
hurry up .
I &apos;ll be right back .
if this is a snatch , don &apos;t take me over the state line .
Miss Graham , Senator Burnett .
Senator ?
so you &apos;re the mystery .
no mystery about me .
just a hick lawyer the voters got stuck with .
- Miss Graham get the job ?
- Yeah , and I think Gates is hooked .
I shouldn &apos;t wonder .
I am too .
now , Senator , I have a boyfriend .
and she don &apos;t mean me .
well , good-bye .
do senators usually have conferences in automobiles ?
hotels have walls and walls sometimes have Dictaphones .
Oh .
know about my committee ?
read the papers ?
Mm , movie columns , gossip columns , football .
how about your history books ?
remember Benedict Arnold ?
sure .
the first all-American heel .
there &apos;s a handful of those heels in this country today .
and they &apos;re powerful enough to sabotage our defense .
we &apos;re trying to expose them .
it &apos;s okay by me .
my committee thinks Gates is one of them .
him ?
the nightclub angel ?
in the daytime , he &apos;s an executive at Nitro Chemical .
in between times , he &apos;s been seeing men ... that are suspected of being foreign agents .
yet our investigators can &apos;t turn up anything definite .
- And that &apos;s where I come in ?
- Will you give it a try ?
well , it isn &apos;t exactly like deciding to go to a beauty parlor .
but if you go through with this , you can &apos;t tell anybody , not even him .
worried about the boyfriend ?
I don &apos;t know what he &apos;ll think when he sees me with four other fellas .
I don &apos;t either .
what do I do ?
can I show you somethin &apos; ?
how much ?
$ 8.98 .
isn &apos;t it beautiful ?

I haven &apos;t looked up his record yet , but I wouldn &apos;t doubt it .

his name is Raven .
is he in now ?
I think so , Officer .
what do you know about him ?
I can tell you .
he &apos;s no good .
you took a present from him , didn &apos;t you ?
it wasn &apos;t a present .
he tore my dress , that &apos;s why .
anyway , I was gonna sell it back and take the money .
how &apos;d he happen to tear your dress ?
all I did was chase his cat out of the room .
and you know what ?
just for that , he hits me right in the face .
he treats everybody like that .
what &apos;s his room number ?
room 9 .
here .
here &apos;s a key .

and you , don &apos;t leave .
when I can see him in handcuffs ?
don &apos;t worry .
I &apos;m going up to his room .

I &apos;ll call home , and you try her at Sissie &apos;s .

Yes , Mrs. Stewart .
the dress shop had the number from the police department .
Gates .
stolen from where ?
I don &apos;t know , Mrs. Stewart .
you do know .
I don &apos;t remember , Mrs. Stewart .

I gave you a dress , didn &apos;t I ?
Yeah .

Oh , that phone &apos;s busy .

Hmm .

I &apos;m going to put a man in the alley .

everything is prepared for the gas mask rehearsal , sir .
we &apos;re ready in the processing plant , sir .
at 8 : 00 tomorrow morning , everyone will be wearing a gas mask .
the same with packing and shipping , Mr. Brewster .
and my department , sir .
I didn &apos;t quite hear you , sir .
that &apos;s excellent .
Mr. Brewster says , &quot; That &apos;s excellent . &quot;
for their own protection , see to it that all my employees take this rehearsal seriously .
they &apos;re the only family I have .
that &apos;s all .
Mr. Brewster , I don &apos;t know how to quite tell you ...
you &apos;re a bungling idiot , Gates !
I gave you a job to do involving millions and you botched it .
I didn &apos;t botch it , sir .
here &apos;s Baker &apos;s letter and the formula .
Raven got those , and then you let him slip through your fat fingers .
is that all ?
as a matter of fact , I don &apos;t know whether they &apos;re working together or not , but there was a girl on the train with Raven .
you know anything about her ?
she &apos;s ... a performer I just hired for my nightclub .
apparently you want to commit suicide .
I didn &apos;t know that when I hired her , and now I &apos;m afraid to turn her over to the police .
they wouldn &apos;t believe anything Raven said , but they might believe her .
you &apos;re a fool !
get down to that club of yours !
uh , take her out somewhere .
f-find out all about her .
and get out of here !
Yes , sir .
when you get to L.A. , you &apos;re to see Mr. Brewster , president of Nitro Chemical Corporation .
old King Chloride , huh ?
headquarters said you &apos;re to go straight to the plant .
Brewster is screaming because we didn &apos;t get Raven .
I &apos;ll see him .
so long , kid .
happy landings .
Hey .
Ellen !
they told me you were coming down .
how are you ?
I don &apos;t know yet .
where &apos;s the telephone ?

Hello , Mr. Gates .
did a man just come in here ?
he had the wrong address .
I sent him around the corner .
thanks .
thanks , pal .
now , don &apos;t worry .
we &apos;ll get him .
I do worry , Lieutenant .
tell him , Mr. Collins .
the man &apos;s a maniac .
why , he threatened to kill me if I gave the police his description .
look what he did to me .
you see ?
one of my oldest employees .
I want him protected .
we &apos;ll put a man with him night and day .
that &apos;s not enough .
this man Raven is a professional killer .
none of us is safe .
- When &apos;d you find that out ?
- This report came in 10 minutes ago .
take it .
read it .
check on it .
my men are at your disposal .
Hmm .
very interesting , Mr. Brewster .
thank you .
thank you , Lieutenant .
I am sure we understand each other .
and for the sake of my employees and your own men , this man Raven should be shot on sight .
good day , Lieutenant .
well , I ...
good day , Lieutenant !
this getup is giving me arthritis .
do you know where this is ?
Yes , indeed .
that &apos;s Hollywood ...
way up in the hills .
you can hitch a ride if you &apos;re broke .
thanks .
you know , when I was a little boy and the rain came down like that , my mother used to say , &quot; God is angry at someone . &quot;
he couldn &apos;t be angry at you , could he ?
Mmm , I don &apos;t remember bending any commandments .
you know , you &apos;re a very intriguing girl .
I want to know all about you .
that &apos;s a big little word , &quot; all . &quot;
well ... practically all .
I looked for you on the train last night .
I thought we might be in the same car .
I tried the observation car , the diner , the Pullmans ...
- I was in the chair car .
- Oh , really ?
isn &apos;t that uncomfortable ?
not for an old trooper .
that is , of course , unless you &apos;re unlucky and your neighbor snores .
were you ... unlucky ?
Oh , no !
I sat with a very charming old lady .
she told me about her farm in Iowa , how her grandmother came out in a covered wagon ...
what &apos;s the matter ?
so you do know him ?
what are you talking about ?
- You were with Raven on that train . I saw you !
- What have you to do with him ?
he &apos;s after me and you &apos;re helping him .
he &apos;ll use that gun , the gun he used on Baker !
why did you get mixed up in this ?
I &apos;m a peaceful man .
I hate violence .
but don &apos;t think I won &apos;t protect myself .
I don &apos;t understand it .
that girl &apos;s so nuts about you , I &apos;m sick of hearing about it .
now all of a sudden she rambles off with that fat wolf .
why ?
if I were you , lover , I &apos;d scram right out there .
that girl &apos;s wrestling by now , or I &apos;m no judge of character .
Yeah .
thanks .
never even scratched her .
we &apos;re a cinch .
in a couple of hours the bridge over the reservoir will be deserted .
look ... Don &apos;t tell me !
I don &apos;t want to know anything about it .
this is a work of art .
the ropes come off .
I tie sash weights to her ankles with soft catgut .
please , that &apos;s a horrible word .
now get the angle on this .
she disappears , two weeks , maybe three .
then up she pops .
none of this stuff on her anymore .
no marks .
a suicide .
now , isn &apos;t that beautiful ?
that &apos;s loathsome !
be sure no one sees you . don &apos;t worry .
I &apos;ll take the other car .
and when they find her ...
don &apos;t tell me !
okay .
between me and the reservoir .
I &apos;ll wait down at the Neptune &apos; til you come .
you &apos;re all upset over nothing , boss .
eat a good dinner .
it &apos;ll calm you down .
such a lovely body .
it &apos;s revolting !
that &apos;s a relief .
come to the club as soon as possible .
Yeah , yeah .
uh , no , sir .
Miss Graham &apos;s been gone about two hours .
I thought she was having dinner here .
not that I know of .
Mr. Gates go with her ?
no , sir .
he just left a few minutes ago .
I &apos;d like to use your phone .
certainly , sir .
excuse me .
it &apos;s right over there .
thanks .
here you are , sir .
this is Police Lieutenant Crane .
give me the Hotel Wilshire right away , please .
Miss Ellen Graham .
Oh , she did ?
what &apos;s the forwarding address ?
huh .
thank you .
do you know where Mr. Gates went ?
no , sir .
but he generally has dinner at the Neptune Club .
Miss Graham is not in any trouble , is she ?
personal matter .
I see .
good night , sir .
good night .
all right , get &apos; em up .
in the back way .
say , what is this ?
against that wall .
now , where is she ?
Oh , the girl ?
Oh , she-she left .
why &apos;d you dump this , then ?
well , she was here , see , but ...
take it easy .
what &apos;s Gates got against you ?
he saw us on the train .
he thinks I &apos;m your girl .
how &apos;d he catch up with you ?
I work in his nightclub .
you got one of those dressing rooms , haven &apos;t you ?
Mm-hmm .
come on .
what for ?
he &apos;s eating there tonight and I want to talk to him alone .
look , I &apos;m not gonna hurt you .
you treated me okay .
but you do what I tell you .
come on .
all right , but you &apos;ll have to help me .
so you &apos;re a copper &apos;s girl .
who told you that ?
he was here lookin &apos; for you , and he better stay away from me .
have you tried her hotel ?
they said she checked out .
then I &apos;m afraid I can &apos;t help you .
for you , sir . Oh .
thank you .
Hello ?
no .
Yes !
he &apos;s got your car .
the girl &apos;s with him .
get out of there fast , boss .
watch that cop .
he &apos;s her boyfriend .
uh , right .
excuse me , uh ... that was business .
I &apos;ve got to leave .
I &apos;ll walk along with you .
we &apos;ve got some more talking to do .
good evening , sir .
go straight to your dressing room .
Michael !
Ellen , where have you been ?
watch it , copper .
it &apos;s Raven .
do what he says .
you stay where you are .
there &apos;s a dragnet out for you , Raven .
it won &apos;t do you any good to hurt her , so use your head .
you better stay put .
stop Gates !
tell him to stay in town .
where &apos;d that couple go ? what couple ?
I didn &apos;t see anyone , sir .
come here !
get on that radio and tell them to round up every police car they can spare .
cover this whole district .
Hey , Mike , I told Gates what you said , but ...
wait a minute .
Hey !
these are Ellen &apos;s !
she &apos;s blazing a trail for us .
tell them to look for cards with these initials on &apos; em .
I &apos;ve got to rest a minute .
it &apos;s the gas works .
we &apos;ll hide out inside until morning .
you stay up on top until I get there .
and don &apos;t try to run .
who do you think I am ?
Whirlaway ?
Hey !
here &apos;s one .
meet us at the other end of this alley .
Hey , look at this .
if we go after him in the dark , somebody &apos;s gonna get hurt .
Ellen maybe .
but if we keep him cooped up until morning , then we can spot him easy .
let &apos;s flood these walls with searchlights .
Yes , sir .
Steve , you and I will go after him alone .
maybe I can talk him into the open .
not him ! I said &quot; maybe .
&quot; give us a boost over .
come on , boys , let &apos;s go .
I &apos;ve been thinking about what you said .
we both took a beating from the same guy , didn &apos;t we ?
Yeah .
I think I know where he &apos;ll be in the morning .
where ?
you &apos;ve got to tell me something first .
I want to know what you &apos;ve got against him .
I did a job for him .
he paid me off in hot money so he could put me where I couldn &apos;t talk .
what was the job ?
your turn now .
you haven &apos;t told me .
your turn now .
he &apos;s at Nitro Chemical .
thanks .
get up on the catwalk .
be careful of Ellen , but if he starts to blast , let him have it .
Raven !
I want to talk to you .
you &apos;re bottled up .
you can &apos;t get out .
we &apos;re moving in when it &apos;s daylight .
we don &apos;t want to shoot unless you make us , so come on out and talk it over .
Raven !
do you hear me , Raven ?
that cop of yours .
we &apos;ve got to move again .
Hey , have you seen anything ?
I &apos;ve looked everywhere and I haven &apos;t seen a thing , sir .
wait .
get in there .
you &apos;re sure there &apos;s no place he can get out ?
that must come out someplace .
go on .
where &apos;s this go ?
to the railroad yards over there .
you stay here .
I &apos;m gonna beat him to it !
go ahead .
when you get on the new bridge , turn your searchlights into the yards .
when we spot that drainpipe , we &apos;ve got him .
all right , step on it .
there &apos;s some sort of light ahead .
keep goin &apos; .
what &apos;s down there ?
looks like a railroad yards .
look out .
get on those searchlights .
over to the right .
turn the other one .
right away , sir .
all right , turn around and drop down .
some fun !
keep every foot of the yard covered .
Yes , sir .
swing the beam to the left .
lower .
Yes , sir .
okay , we &apos;ll keep &apos; em here &apos; til morning .
still bottled up .
why don &apos;t you hop a rattler and get out of this ?
I &apos;ve got that job to do .
come on , we &apos;ll find an empty .
take it easy .
I &apos;ve got a twisted ankle .
Hogan , take 15 men and stop every train going in or out .
you certainly pack an arsenal .
something I took from Gates &apos; chauffeur .
what happened ?
drain pipe wire .
you &apos;ll get dirt in it .
have you got a handkerchief ?
forget it , will ya ?
that &apos;s it , boys .
cover the whole yard .
that &apos;s enough .
you &apos;re a funny guy .
you like my doing that , but you won &apos;t admit it .
that &apos;s sucker talk .
you killed Baker .
Gates told me .
who &apos;s the man behind him ?
that &apos;s what I &apos;m trying to find out .
maybe I can help .
you must have some idea who it is .
Baker was blackmailing the guy behind Gates .
he was going to send a letter about him to Washington .
I gave it to sweet-tooth .
what was in it ?
piece of paper with some kind of arithmetic on it .
a prescription he called it .
like a chemical formula ?
how do I know ?
was the letter going to Senator Burnett ?
huh ?
Yeah , that was his name .
Hey , this is good luck .
cats bring you luck .
and it &apos;s hungry .
ain &apos;t got nothin &apos; for you , Tuffy .
you like cats , don &apos;t you ?
Yeah .
they &apos;re on their own .
they don &apos;t need anybody .
well , this one could do with a friend .
so could you .
you &apos;re tryin &apos; to make me go soft .
well , you can save your oil .
I don &apos;t go soft for anybody .
I could put somebody else in charge .
I &apos;d appreciate it if you didn &apos;t .
what about your girl ?
that &apos;s just the point .
this guy &apos;s a killer , all right .
I &apos;ve checked Brewster &apos;s information .
that &apos;s why I want to wait &apos; til morning and gas him out .
they &apos;ll move in in the morning .
every flatfoot in town .
you know , I &apos;ve been figuring something .
that chemical formula .
Yeah ?
I bet I know what it is .
what ?
gas .
poison gas .
they &apos;re selling it to our enemy .
so ?
so tomorrow they &apos;ll ship it back in bombs .
Japanese breakfast food for America .
did you hear what I said ?
it &apos;s important .
this war is everybody &apos;s business .
yours too .
Mr. Gates is still eating his peppermints .
that &apos;s my business .
why don &apos;t you stop thinking about yourself for a minute ?
who else is gonna ?
Hey , look out for that clothesline !
some doings tonight .
a cop wherever you spit .
Yeah .
how &apos;d you like to be worth 5,000 smackers dead or alive ?
wouldn &apos;t care for it dead .
did you hear that ?
that meowing ?
come on .
they don &apos;t pay off on cats .
let it up .
they &apos;ve gone .
let it up .
it &apos;s dead .
I killed it .
I killed my luck .
you got the break , Tuffy .
I &apos;d like to crawl down there with you and sleep .
why don &apos;t you sleep for a while ?
it &apos;s no good .
I &apos;d only dream .
every night I dream .
I read somewhere about a kind of doctor , a psycho-something .
if you tell your dream , you don &apos;t have to dream it anymore .
that &apos;s right .
you ...
you wouldn &apos;t laugh if I told ya , would ya ?
it &apos;s a woman .
I dream about a woman .
she used to beat me .
to whip the bad blood out of me , she said .
my old man was hanged .
my mother died right after that , and I went to live with that woman ... my aunt .
she beat me from the time I was three &apos; til I was 14 .
one day she ... caught me reaching for a piece of chocolate .
she was saving it for a cake .
a crummy piece of chocolate .
she hit me ... with a red-hot flatiron .
smashed my wrist with it .
I grabbed a knife .
I let her have it ... in the throat !
they stuck a label on me ... killer .
they shoved me in a reform school , and they beat me there too !
but I &apos;m glad I killed her .
what &apos;s the use ?
there &apos;s nothing I can do .
there is something you can do .
don &apos;t kill anymore .
you &apos;re just killing her all over again .
that &apos;s all you &apos;re doing .
you don &apos;t really want to get Gates .
what do you want me to do , send him some candy ?
I want you to make him spill the whole works .
who &apos;s behind him , names , everything .
I want a signed confession .
that &apos;s more important than killing him .
it &apos;s important to your country .
come on , take your hands off of me .
button up , will ya ?
I &apos;ll take care of Gates my way .
no , please !
get away from me .
go on , get away .
gonna wait for it to lift ?
we &apos;ll have to .
it &apos;s thicker than gravy down there .
no chance for a getaway .
an eel couldn &apos;t get through .
we &apos;ve got every foot covered .
they &apos;re waitin &apos; for my whistle the minute it clears .
no soap , huh ?
too many of &apos; em .
but I got a proposition for ya .
you still want that stuff from Gates ?
of course I do .
help me outta here and I &apos;ll get it for you .
or was that hot air last night , that flag-waving ?
come on , make up your mind .
okay , I &apos;ll shoot it out with &apos; em .
I hope your copper gets the first slug .
no , wait a minute !
promise me you won &apos;t use that anymore .
all right .
it &apos;s a deal .
you go first , across the yard .
don &apos;t run or they &apos;ll know it &apos;s a woman .
here , take this .
wait &apos; til they spot you , then get under something .
stall as long as you can , then come out with your hands up .
now ?
let them go first .
wait for the whistle .
we &apos;ll give it another minute .
you &apos;re gonna marry that copper ?
right guy for ya ?
Mm-hmm .
okay .
all right , go ahead .
look !
spread out , but watch me .
send Glennon up the embankment .
right away , sir .
he &apos;s underneath there .
all right , boys , let &apos;s use the gas on him .
chuck .
so old man Brewster was right .
she is Raven &apos;s girl , huh ?
all right , Crane , I &apos;ll take over .

Hey , get outta there !
Ellen , you &apos;ve got to tell me .
where &apos;d he go ?
Mike ?

Yeah ?

Yeah .
he promised me he wouldn &apos;t .
where &apos;d he go ?
now use your head !
that guy &apos;s a killer !
how did you meet him ?
what were you doing with him ?
I can &apos;t tell you .
this isn &apos;t a cop asking .
it &apos;s me .
he saved my life .
where ?
at Gates &apos; house ?
what was he doing there ?
so that &apos;s who he &apos;s after .
he &apos;s headed for Nitro !
well , so are we .
what &apos;s the matter ?
did I scare ya ?
this is no time to be funny !
I &apos;m sorry , boss .
take it easy .
did you see the rehearsal ?
it &apos;s started .
Yes , it gives me the shivers .
any news from the police ? Yes .
they &apos;re waiting for the fog to lift .
what &apos;s the matter with them ?
it &apos;s lifted !
then everything &apos;s okay .
I hope so .
but you stay out there in front of my door .
no visitors .
leave it to me .
will ya take it easy ?
you only got one life .
ladies and gentlemen , we will first visit the processing plant .
this way , please .
what ?
when ?
Raven &apos;s escaped !
he &apos;s coming here !
phone the company police , and tell Tommy not to budge from that door .
Tommy ?
Tommy !
Mr. Gates , Tommy isn &apos;t there .
isn &apos;t there ?
well , f-find him !
Tommy , where have you been ?
Mr. Gates wants you in his office .
hurry !
Tommy , you &apos;re getting very lax .
don &apos;t you realize that maniac could &apos;ve walked right in here ?
the old man wants to see me .
while I &apos;m up there , get me a bottle of Scotch .
I need it .
this hot money too ?
what ?
Miss ...
no , you don &apos;t .
I &apos;m not to blame .
you wouldn &apos;t ... kill an innocent man , would you ?
it &apos;s all his fault .
I was acting as his agent .
quiet .
we &apos;ll both see the old man .
get up .
come on .
Yes . Yes .
tell Mr. Brewster he &apos;ll be right up .
Mr. Gates .
Hello , Tommy .

he escaped from the railroad yards .
and Mr. Brewster is having a fit about it !
well ... what delayed ya ?
what &apos;s the matter with ya ?
put that thing away .
that &apos;s him , huh ?
what do you want ?
my name &apos;s Raven .
don &apos;t answer it .

this button , it rings the alarm and opens the doors .
for 15 years !
dressing you , nursing you , cleaning you , listening to your dirty deals .
go ahead , wipe him out !
we got business to do .
come on , give him that pad .
can you get to that office from the roof ?
no , sir . wait a minute .
there &apos;s a painter &apos;s scaffold up there .
- Come on !
- Who are you selling that gas to ?
you look like a young man who knows a good thing .
why don &apos;t you ...
- Do what he says !
he &apos;ll kill you !
- Stop whining !
I &apos;ll tell you .
that new gas formula , he sold it to the highest bidder .
you &apos;ve just committed suicide , Gates .
to the Japanese !
you know this stuff .
you write it , and he &apos;ll sign .
I will not sign it !
and don &apos;t you think I will , young man !
you &apos;ll sign .
let her go .
there .
if you want any more , there &apos;s the medal for services rendered ... from his boyfriends abroad !
H-How much do you want , Raven ?
I &apos;m a rich man .
take that pen while you still got a chance .
Oh , h-h-how foolish young men are .
all right , you &apos;re next .
Oh , yes , yes , I &apos;ll sign .
look out !
dead .
his heart .
one final double-cross .
believe me , it was Brewster !
there &apos;s something else .
you tried to kill that girl .
no .
no ! that girl &apos;s my friend .
she &apos;s not your friend .
she told the police .
- Shut up !
- They called me up !
- You &apos;re lying !
why are they here ?
she told them !
she ...
so this was it .
you didn &apos;t tell the cops , did ya ?
did I do all right for you ?
Oh , Michael , my darling , hold me .
Lubinski , Kubinski ...
Lominski , Rozanski and Poznanski .
we &apos;re in Warsaw , the capital of Poland .
it &apos;s August , 1939 . Europe is still at peace .
at the moment , life in Warsaw is going on as normally as ever .
but suddenly , something seems to have happened .
are those Poles seeing a ghost ?
why does this car suddenly stop ?
everybody seems to be staring in one direction .
people seem to be frightened , even terrified .
some flabbergasted .
can it be true ? it must be true . no doubt .
the man with the little mustache , Adolf Hitler .
Adolf Hitler in Warsaw when the two countries are still at peace ... and all by himself ?
he seems strangely unconcerned by all the excitement he &apos;s causing .
is he by any chance interested in Mr. Maslowski &apos;s delicatessen ?
that &apos;s impossible ! he &apos;s a vegetarian .
and yet , he doesn &apos;t always stick to his diet .
sometimes he swallows whole countries .
does he want to eat up Poland , too ?
anyhow , how did he get here ? what happened ?
it all started in the General Headquarters of the Gestapo in Berlin .
Heil Hitler .
- Heil Hitler !
- Colonel , we have Wilhelm Coetze here .
if you &apos;d like to look into his record .
- I hope he &apos;ll talk .
- He &apos;d better .
- Send him in .
- Yes , sir .
Wilhelm Coetze !
Heil Hitler !
and now , Wilhelm , I understand you want a little tank to play with .
Yes , my father promised me one if I got a good report card .
but our Führer heard about your report card ... and decided to give you just what you want .
Heil Hitler !
you are going to tell your father who gave it to you , aren &apos;t you , Wilhelm ?
sure , our Führer .
and then maybe he will like the Führer a little better , won &apos;t he ?
sure .
- He doesn &apos;t like him now , does he ?
- No , he doesn &apos;t .
and sometimes he even says funny things about him , doesn &apos;t he ?
well , he said they named a brandy after Napoleon ... and they made a herring out of Bismarck .
- And Hitler &apos;s going to end up as ...
- A piece of cheese .
- Yes .
- Yeah .
- How did you know ?
- Well , it &apos;s a natural thought .
a natural thought ?
I hope you don &apos;t misunderstand . I always , that is ...
you see , Colonel , I hope you don &apos;t doubt my ...
Heil Hitler !
the Führer .
Heil Hitler !
Heil myself .
that &apos;s not in the script .
- But , Mr. Dobosh , please .
- That &apos;s not in the script , Mr. Bronski .
- But it &apos;ll get a laugh .
- I don &apos;t want a laugh here .
how many times have I told you not to add any lines ?
- I want ...
- You want my opinion , Mr. Dobosh ?
no , I don &apos;t want your opinion .
all right , then let me give you my reaction .
a laugh is nothing to be sneezed at .
Mr. Greenberg , I hired you as an actor , not as a writer .
understand ?
what does the script say ?
- I make an entrance .
- And what do you say ?
- Nothing .
- Then say nothing .
here am I sitting , waiting for my scene , all eager to go ... and I have to wait and wait to be driven out of my mood ... just because two little actors in the cast want to enlarge their parts .
Mr. Rawitch , what you are , I wouldn &apos;t eat .
how dare you call me a ham !
folks , I want everybody to understand this .
this is a serious play , a realistic drama ...
- Good morning , Dobosh .
- Good morning .
- How do you like my dress ?
- Very good .
it is a document of Nazi ...
is that what you &apos;re wearing in the concentration camp ?
- Don &apos;t you think it &apos;s pretty ?
- That &apos;s it .
well , why not ? I think it &apos;s a tremendous contrast .
think of me being flogged in the darkness .
I scream , the lights go on ... and the audience sees me on the floor in this gorgeous dress .
- That &apos;s a terrific laugh .
- That &apos;s right , Greenberg .
you keep out of this !
that a great star , an artist , could be so inartistic .
you must be out of your mind .
what do you mean by talking to my wife like that ? how dare you !
I &apos;m sorry . I lost my temper .
sweetheart , the dress stinks .
you &apos;re only afraid I &apos;m running away with the scene .
I afraid ? why should I be ?
of course not . you &apos;re the best actor in the world .
- Everybody knows that , even you .
- Don &apos;t be a prima donna .
any chance to take the spotlight away from me , it &apos;s ridiculous how you grab it .
whenever I start a story , you finish it .
if I go on a diet , you lose the weight .
if I have a cold , you cough .
if we should ever have a baby , I &apos;m not so sure I &apos;d be the mother .
I &apos;m satisfied to be the father .
Mr. Dobosh , look , if you &apos;ll just give me a chance ...
- Who made you up ?
- I did , Mr. Dobosh .
- What &apos;s wrong with it ?
- I don &apos;t know . it &apos;s not convincing .
to me , he &apos;s just a man with a little mustache .
but so was Hitler .
wait , it &apos;s not just the mustache . it &apos;s ... I don &apos;t know .
- I just can &apos;t smell Hitler in him .
- I can .
I know .
that picture . that &apos;s what he should look like .
but that picture was taken of me .
then the picture &apos;s wrong , too .
now , see here , Mr. Dobosh , I &apos;m a nobody and I have to take a lot .
but I know I look like Hitler , and I &apos;m going to prove it right now .
I &apos;m going out on the street and see what happens .
and that &apos;s how Adolf Hitler came to Warsaw in August , 1939 .
may I have your autograph , Mr. Bronski ?
- Bronski ?
- Why , certainly .
I know it would get a laugh .
then Dobosh said to me , &quot; Bronski , you &apos;re going to play Hitler . &quot;
I thought that was the real start of my career .
don &apos;t worry , Bronski . they can &apos;t keep real talent down forever .
and the day will come when you &apos;ll play Shylock .
the Rialto scene .
Shakespeare must have thought of me when he wrote this .
&quot; have I not eyes ? have I not hands ...
&quot; organs , senses , dimensions , affections , passions ?
&quot; fed with the same food , hurt with the same weapons ...
&quot; subject to the same diseases .
&quot; if you prick us , do we not bleed ?
&quot; if you tickle us , do we not laugh ?
&quot; if you poison us , do we not die ? &quot;
you &apos;d move them to tears .
- Instead , I have to carry a spear .
- That &apos;s all we do , carry a spear .
carry a spear in the first act , and in the second act .
carry Rawitch off the scene in the last act .
how I &apos;d love to drop that ham right in the center of the stage .
would get a terrific laugh .
Hello , this is Mr. Tura .
please order me a salami and cheese sandwich and a glass of beer .
right away , please . thank you .
- The audience is a little cool tonight .
- Not to me .
I know I &apos;m giving a rotten performance .
I always do when we quarrel .
- Say something nice .
- You faker .
I watched your scene with Polonius .
you were never better .
I &apos;d give you a kiss right now , but I &apos;m afraid I &apos;ll ruin my makeup .
darling , you were right this morning .
I felt so rotten after the rehearsal , I went to Dobosh and told him ... when he advertises the new play to put your name first .
did you , darling ? that &apos;s sweet of you . but I really don &apos;t care .
that &apos;s what Dobosh said , so we left it as it was .
but , darling , you know how I feel about you .
why I &apos;d even ...
- Flowers ?
- Aren &apos;t they beautiful ?
- Don &apos;t be casual . who sent them ? - I don &apos;t know .
there was no card .
no card again ?
that &apos;s three nights in succession . who is he ?
I &apos;m sure this has nothing to do with me personally .
this man probably loves theater , an art fanatic .
someone sitting in the gallery night after night ...
just one of those poor boys who can &apos;t afford a ticket ... but inherited a lot of flowers and is trying to get rid of them .
three nights in a row .
even Shakespeare couldn &apos;t see Hamlet three nights in succession .
- You forget you &apos;re playing Hamlet . - That &apos;s right .
Mr. Tura on stage !
Maria , darling , I &apos;m going into my big scene .
Joseph , sweetheart , I swear I don &apos;t know who it is .
thanks , darling .
it &apos;s true , Anna , I don &apos;t know who it is .
but I &apos;m positive who it might be .
- You mean that young aviator ?
- Yes , he &apos;s very young .
he &apos;s in the second row again . he gets better-looking every night .
don &apos;t misunderstand me . I love my husband dearly , and why not ?
he &apos;s wonderful .
only he gets so unreasonable , so upset about little things .
like the little thing in the second row .
waiting for an answer .
&quot; it . Stanislav Sobinski . &quot; I was right , it is a young aviator .
- Is he suffering very much ?
- Yes , he had to break his silence .
- He couldn &apos;t bear it any longer ?
- No , he couldn &apos;t .
- Poor little thing .
- He &apos;s just a mere boy .
- Oh , no .
- What &apos;s he want you to do , adopt him ?
he &apos;s dying to see me , even if it &apos;s just for a minute .
of course I won &apos;t . definitely not .
yet , I don &apos;t like to be rude to him .
I think it &apos;s a mistake to ignore people who admire one and buy the tickets ...
darling , don &apos;t waste any more time with excuses .
if you want to see him , see him while he &apos;s still young .
Yes , I think I owe it to my public .
dear Lieutenant ...
wait till you see him , Anna .
unfortunately my time is completely taken up .
but if you insist on seeing me , come back to my dressing room ... when Hamlet goes into his soliloquy , &quot; To be or not to be . &quot;
- How does it sound ?
- Safe .
&quot; O heavy burden ! &quot;
&quot; I hear him coming
&quot; let &apos;s withdraw , my lord . &quot;
&quot; to be , or not to be :
&quot; that is the question :
&quot; whether &apos; tis nobler in the mind to suffer
&quot; the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune ...
&quot; or to take arms ... &quot;
thank you , Mrs. Tura , for receiving me .
if you knew how I was looking forward to this moment ...
- And now you &apos;re probably disappointed .
- Mrs. Tura .
- Please sit down .
- Thank you .
so you are the gentleman that sent me those lovely flowers . thank you .
somehow , I pictured you quite differently as a dignified old gentleman .
and now I see you ...
I wonder if it was the right thing to ask you back here .
you see , I never see strangers in my dressing room .
but you are no stranger to me .
I &apos;ve seen you in everything you &apos;ve played .
I &apos;ll never forget how I laughed when I saw you as Kiki .
some people thought I was funny .
but you certainly weren &apos;t funny when you played Lady Macbeth .
- Thank you .
- I was really scared of you that night .
of poor little me ? I wouldn &apos;t hurt a fly .
or a goldfish . by the way , how is he ?
- Who ?
- The goldfish .
- What goldfish ?
- The one you &apos;re so attached to .
you see , I read all your interviews .
Oh , yes , of course .
when I saw that picture of you at the farm , behind the plough ...
- By the way , where was that ?
- In The Chronicle .
no , I mean , where is the farm ?
no , I think we &apos;ve talked much too much about me .
tell me about yourself .
there isn &apos;t much to tell . I just fly a bomber .
how perfectly thrilling .
I don &apos;t know about its being thrilling , but it &apos;s quite a bomber .
you may not believe it , but I can drop three tons of dynamite in two minutes .
- Really ?
- Does that interest you ?
it certainly does .
I don &apos;t want to overstep myself , but I &apos;ll take a chance .
would you permit me to show you my plane ?
- Maybe .
- When shall I call for you ?
tomorrow at 2 : 00 at my home .
no , I &apos;d better meet you right at the airport .
Goodbye .
I hope you forgive me if I acted a little clumsy ... but this is the first time I ever met an actress .
Lieutenant , this is the first time I &apos;ve ever met a man ... who could drop three tons of dynamite in two minutes .
Bye .
tomorrow at 2 : 00 , I &apos;m gonna look down on Warsaw .
he &apos;s gonna take me up 10,000 feet in the air .
there &apos;s nothing wrong in that , is there ?
no , not at all . as long as Tura doesn &apos;t find out .
after all , what a husband doesn &apos;t know won &apos;t hurt his wife .
it happened .
what every actor dreads .
what , darling ?
someone walked out on me .
tell me , Maria , am I losing my grip ?
of course not , darling . I &apos;m so sorry .
but he walked out on me .
maybe he didn &apos;t feel well . maybe he had to leave .
maybe he had a sudden heart attack .
- I hope so .
- If he stayed , he might have died .
maybe he &apos;s dead already . darling , you &apos;re so comforting .
- What &apos;s going on ?
- Hitler &apos;s speaking to the Reichstag .
- How do you do , Mr. Dobosh ?
- How do you do , Doctor ?
this is Dr. Voyawski from the Foreign Office .
how do you do , gentlemen ?
I &apos;m afraid I have some bad news for you .
the government feels it would be unwise to go on with this play .
what ?
you mean , we cannot open tonight ?
- I &apos;m afraid that &apos;s what it comes down to .
- We all have a right to know .
- I know the play has artistic value .
it has much more than that .
that &apos;s exactly what the government is afraid of .
it might offend Hitler .
well , wouldn &apos;t that be too bad .
have you ever read what he says about us ?
do you ever listen to him ?
I &apos;m sorry , gentlemen , but the order is final .
&quot; to be , or not to be :
&quot; that is the question :
&quot; whether &apos; tis nobler in the mind to suffer
&quot; the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune ... &quot;
Anna , I &apos;d like to speak to Mrs. Tura alone .
now look , Stanislav , I usually tell my maid when to leave the room .
I have so much to tell you .
when we &apos;re in the plane , we can &apos;t talk .
when we &apos;re in the tearoom , we can &apos;t do anything but talk .
when we &apos;re in the dressing room , we must be very careful of my makeup .
you know , Maria , the other day in the plane ... you didn &apos;t think I was watching but I saw you looking at me .
it was a very sympathetic look , I thought .
I had the feeling you like me . was I wrong ?
no , not at all , Stanislav .
- Tell me , Maria . be frank . you still like me ?
- Well , of course .
you still like me , huh ? you think you &apos;ll always like me ?
I don &apos;t see any reason why not .
that &apos;s wonderful .
what are we going to do with your husband ?
- What ?
- We must tell him , of course .
tell him what ?
that we love each other , that we &apos;re mad about each other .
he has no right to stand in our way .
I &apos;m sure he &apos;ll realize the situation . so will Mr. Dobosh .
- Dobosh ? where does he come in ?
- You don &apos;t want to stay on the stage ?
I wouldn &apos;t let you . you &apos;re tired of it , anyway .
you want to live a quiet life . you said so in The Chronicle .
darling , you &apos;re really going to enjoy that farm now .
you won &apos;t have to use that plough . I &apos;ll buy you a tractor .
I &apos;ll build a swimming pool for your goldfish .
you &apos;re really a darling ... but you don &apos;t realize that I &apos;m a married woman .
- That &apos;s why I must talk to your husband .
- But I love my husband .
no , you don &apos;t .
you &apos;re just decent , you &apos;re kind , and you feel sorry for him .
now , don &apos;t you worry . it &apos;s a situation between men .
- I &apos;ll wait here for him .
- Stanislav , you must listen to me .
this is all my fault , but you must understand that I ...
- Mrs. Tura !
- Stay out , Anna .
Mrs. Tura , it &apos;s war !
&quot; without any declaration of war ...
&quot; German troops crossed our border at several points this evening . &quot;
without a word of warning .
they &apos;ll pay before they &apos;re through . we &apos;ll fight them .
war . it &apos;s really war .
people are going to kill each other and be killed .
Goodbye , Maria .
- Stanislav , come back .
- I have to .
I have to see you again .
- Maria , have you heard ?
- Yes , it &apos;s war .
it seems impossible . it &apos;s incredible .
- Does the audience know ?
- No , I have to tell them .
it &apos;s a conspiracy . a foul conspiracy !
- It &apos;s worse than that . it &apos;s a crime !
- Absolutely right .
walking out on me for the second time .
- What are you talking about ?
- Don &apos;t you understand ? it &apos;s war !
it &apos;s an air alarm !
close the window ! hurry up , to the basement . quick !
anyway , we don &apos;t have to worry about the Nazi play anymore .
the Nazis themselves are putting on the show now . a much bigger one .
there &apos;s no censor to stop them .
unhappy Poland .
attacked without a word of warning by a ruthless conqueror .
Warsaw destroyed for the sake of destruction .
the curtain had fallen on the Polish drama :
a tragedy with no relief in sight .
there was a Nazi tank against every Polish hope ... and the people were stunned and helpless .
there was no censor to stop them .
&quot; if you prick us , do we not bleed ?
&quot; if you tickle us , do we not laugh ?
&quot; if you poison us , do we not die ? &quot;
what a Shylock you would have been .
all I had to do was to carry a spear .
I wonder if we &apos;ll ever carry a spear again .
let &apos;s hope so .
but a new spirit had come over the people of Poland .
hate and more hate was the answer to the Nazi terror .
rebellion against suppression .
determination to fight at any moment , anywhere , everywhere .
the battle was on . &quot; V. &quot;
&quot; V &quot; for &quot; victory ! &quot;
down with the Nazis ! down with Hitler !
the Warsaw underground striking back ... sabotage , destruction .
but the real fight for Polish freedom was led somewhere in England .
young men of Poland avenging their country ... the Polish squadron of the RAF .
well , it &apos;s gratifying to see that you still keep your sense of humor .
we are even much funnier over Berlin .
I wish that I were young enough to do for our country what you &apos;re doing .
come on , Professor .
one of your radio speeches is worth 10,000 bombs .
when do we hear you again , Professor Siletsky ?
I &apos;m afraid it might be quite some time . why ?
what &apos;s the matter ? nothing .
I just happen to be going on a little trip .
and anybody that buys a return ticket these days is decidedly an optimist .
you are going on a secret mission , Professor ?
I see it &apos;s no use . you boys are too clever for me . now I know .
he &apos;s going to Berlin to call on Hitler .
not exactly . and I certainly hope that Hitler doesn &apos;t call on me .
thank you for honoring me with an excellent dinner .
- Professor , are you going to Warsaw ? - That would be risking your neck .
after all , you boys risk your lives every day , don &apos;t you ?
so you are going to Warsaw .
please , I can &apos;t tell you any more .
I &apos;m sorry that I even mentioned it . - But you didn &apos;t .
- We got it out of you .
after all , if I can &apos;t trust you , whom can I trust ?
and I know it will be buried right here .
Warsaw .
I &apos;d give my soul to be there for just one hour to see my mother .
if she &apos;s still alive .
I only wish it were possible for me to find out .
could you find out , please ? my mother ...
I understand exactly how you feel . but you must realize ...
I cannot possibly jeopardize the purpose of my trip .
why don &apos;t you tell me where I can reach your people ... and I &apos;ll try my best ?
- Professor Siletsky ? - Yes .
my people are fortunately out of Poland ... but there is someone in Warsaw .
- A lady ? - Yes .
it &apos;s a very confidential matter .
I &apos;d appreciate it if you &apos;d tell her ...
- But don &apos;t tell her husband .
- I know exactly what to tell her .
just say , &quot; To be or not to be . &quot; she knows .
a code message ?
what &apos;s the name of the lady ?
- It &apos;s Maria Tura . - Just a moment .
I &apos;ll write it down .
what did you say the name was ?
T-U-R-A .
is that correct ?
don &apos;t tell me you &apos;ve never heard of Maria Tura ? why ?
should I ?
- Well , you lived in Warsaw ...
- Yes , of course . the name is familiar .
she &apos;s quite well-known . - Well-known ?
she &apos;s famous . - Yes , indeed .
here , it &apos;s the name of my brother .
I don &apos;t know if you can read the writing .
- All right . - Lieutenant .
- How do you do , sir ? - Gen. Armstrong .
- Major Cunningham .
- How do you do ?
now what did you want to see me about , Lieutenant ?
I was thinking about coming here for a couple of days .
I &apos;m probably doing an injustice to an important man . whom do you suspect ?
you see , sir , the other night ...
Professor Siletsky was addressing us at the camp ... and I mentioned the name of Maria Tura and he &apos;d never heard of her .
neither have I .
but he &apos;s supposed to be a Pole who lived in Warsaw .
she &apos;s the most famous actress in Warsaw .
young man , there are lots of people who are not interested in the theater .
there &apos;s only one actress I ever heard of .
and I certainly hope I &apos;ll never hear from her again .
sir , Maria Tura &apos;s more than an actress . she &apos;s an institution .
you couldn &apos;t buy a newspaper without reading about her .
you can &apos;t buy a package of cigarettes without her picture inside . they name soap after her .
you couldn &apos;t move around in Warsaw without popping into her .
I thought it was my duty to tell you before the professor leaves .
- He left already , didn &apos;t he ?
- Yes , he was due in Sweden yesterday .
just a minute .
how &apos;d you know he was leaving ? - He told us .
- Told you what ?
- That he was going to Warsaw .
- That seems incredible .
after all , we were all Poles together , nobody saw anything wrong in it .
otherwise , the boys wouldn &apos;t give him the addresses . - What addresses ?
- Of the relatives in Warsaw .
- He took them ?
- Yes , sir .
how could he do such a thing ?
if they fall into the hands of the Gestapo ... they can take reprisals against all the families .
when does Professor Siletsky get to Warsaw ?
he probably took the boat today for Lithuania .
and from Lithuania , that &apos;s uncertain . I shall say , three or four days , sir .
how long will it take you to fly to Warsaw ?
about six or seven hours , sir .
- You mind waiting outside a minute ? - Yes , sir .
I hate to believe it . so do I , sir .
we can &apos;t take any chances .
the fellow came here with the highest recommendations possible .
and we checked again and again , sir .
this man is carrying instructions to the underground in Warsaw .
if he delivers them ... to the Gestapo instead of the underground ... it means , not only the death of hundreds of people ... but the destruction of our organization in Eastern Europe .
of course .
but I hate to condemn a man on such vague evidence .
we &apos;re not condemning him .
when Siletsky told those fliers of his trip to Warsaw , he wrote his own sentence .
of course , he may be just a fool .
then he &apos;s just as dangerous .
and I know Siletsky . he &apos;s no fool .
well , sir , what are your orders ?
- Call in the young man . - Yes , sir .
now look here , Lieutenant ... as soon as you get to Warsaw ... go to Sztaluga &apos;s bookstore ... and give him our instructions .
Sztaluga will then inform the underground .
but if someone happens to be in the store , don &apos;t mention anything .
just ask for a copy ... of Tolstoy &apos;s Anna Karenina .
and put Siletsky &apos;s picture on Page 105 . - Is that clear ?
- Yes , sir .
- Ten minutes .
- All right .
Halt !
too bad we missed him .
- Good evening .
- Good evening .
have you by any chance Anna Karenina by Tolstoy ?
I think I have .
Yes .
here it is .
- How much is it ?
- 20 zloty .
that &apos;s much too expensive , I &apos;m sorry .
Goodbye .
- We &apos;ll take these stamps .
- How much ?
eight zloty 75 .
Goodbye , gentlemen . come again .
Yes , can I help you gentlemen ?
- We are looking for Mrs. Maria Tura .
- I am Mrs. Tura .
you have to come along with us .
I haven &apos;t done anything . why do they want me ?
just come along . let &apos;s go .
205 , 206 .
Mrs. Tura is here , sir .
Yes , sir .
- Let her wait in 206 .
- Yes , sir .
good evening , Mrs. Tura .
- Good evening .
- I &apos;m Professor Siletsky .
it &apos;s a great pleasure to meet you , Mrs. Tura .
won &apos;t you sit down ?
- Cigarette ?
- Thank you .
I really must apologize for the manner in which you were brought here .
when a man wants to see a lady so badly ... he backs up his invitation with bane .
that &apos;s very well put .
as a matter of fact , I &apos;m not responsible for your being brought here at all .
there &apos;s a charming young man in England ...
gave me a message for you .
a rather strange message .
&quot; to be or not to be . &quot;
you , no doubt know its deeper meaning .
Yes , I have a vague idea .
I really ...
will you forgive me , please ?
Hello ? Yes .
how do you do , Colonel Ehrhardt ?
Yes , the trip was a little bumpy ... but I &apos;m certainly glad that you sent that plane to Sweden .
otherwise ...
whenever you wish , of course .
10 : 00 tomorrow morning at Gestapo Headquarters ... unless I hear from you tonight .
very well .
I &apos;m looking forward to making your acquaintance .
Goodbye , Colonel .
- I &apos;m sorry .
- Well , I won &apos;t keep you any longer .
thank you for the charming message .
- Mrs. Tura , you &apos;re an actress , aren &apos;t you ?
- Yes .
naturally , in the theater it &apos;s important that you choose the right part .
very .
but in real life , it &apos;s even more important that you choose the right side .
the right side .
what is the right side ?
the winning side .
I don &apos;t quite understand .
here in Warsaw , there are a lot of people ... that we know very well and a lot of people ... that we don &apos;t know quite so well and would like to know a great deal better .
that &apos;s where you can help us , Mrs. Tura .
you want me to be a spy ?
now , come , that &apos;s rather a crude word .
I once played a spy , it was a great success .
I had wonderful notices . it was really an exciting part .
wouldn &apos;t it be exciting to play it in real life ?
I got shot in the last act .
I suppose that happens to most spies .
my dear Mrs. Tura , we would never dream ... of subjecting anybody as charming as you to danger .
all you &apos;d have to do would be to entertain a little .
for instance , invite certain people ...
I can see myself giving a great banquet in my one-room mansion .
of course , they took my lovely apartment away from me .
I assure you that can be very easily remedied .
life could be made ... very comfortable for you again , Mrs. Tura .
well , what do you say ?
naturally , it &apos;s all very attractive and tempting .
but what are we going to do about my conscience ?
we &apos;ve simply got to convince you that you &apos;re going to serve the right cause .
I wonder if you really know what Nazism stands for .
I have a slight idea .
in the final analysis , all we &apos;re trying to do is create a happy world .
people who don &apos;t want to be happy have no place in this happy world .
that makes sense .
we &apos;re not brutal , we &apos;re not monsters .
tell me ... do I look like a monster ?
of course not , Professor .
you say that as though you really meant it . - I do .
- We &apos;re just like other people .
we love to sing , we love to dance ... we admire beautiful women .
we &apos;re human . and sometimes ...
- very human . - I &apos;m convinced of that .
why don &apos;t you stay here for dinner ? I can imagine nothing more charming .
and before the evening is over , I &apos;m sure you &apos;ll say , &quot; Heil Hitler . &quot;
I would like to accept your invitation ... but just as you want to represent the Nazi case in the very best light ...
I would like to represent the Polish case in a more suitable dress .
I understand perfectly . please don &apos;t let me wait too long . - Au revoir .
- Just a moment .
- I &apos;m looking forward to it .
- So am I .
- This lady is permitted to leave . - Yes , sir .
this is a very difficult place to get in , but it &apos;s much more difficult to get out .
I &apos;m terribly frightened and terribly thrilled . - Bye .
- Bye .
&quot; to be or not to be . &quot;
I &apos;m feeling much better . I &apos;m glad at that .
who are you ? how did you get here ?
parachute . I jumped from a plane .
right into my bed ? how did you get into my apartment ? your wife ...
isn &apos;t she back ?
I &apos;m getting worried . - You &apos;re worried ?
I &apos;m worried .
- Not so loud , you might endanger all of us .
- After all , we &apos;re all in the same boat .
- Oh , the same boat ?
then let me ask you something as one sailor to another :
what ill-wind blew you into my slippers ?
- Siletsky is here . - What ?
at the Hotel Europe .
they took me to him .
- What &apos;d you do at the book store ?
- I warned them against Siletsky . Siletsky here .
then everything &apos;s over .
there &apos;s still a chance , Siletsky hasn &apos;t seen the Gestapo . we have to get to him .
it &apos;s impossible .
it &apos;s an armed camp . soldiers everywhere . does he know I &apos;m here ?
no , but he wants me to become a Nazi spy .
- Who wants you to become a Nazi spy ? - Siletsky .
- Who is Siletsky ?
- A spy .
- And who is he ?
- Lieutenant Sobinski .
what are you doing here ?
what does that matter ?
don &apos;t you understand ? Siletsky &apos;s here .
it &apos;s unbelievable !
I come home to find a man in the same boat with me ... and my wife says , &quot; What does it matter ? &quot;
but Mr. Tura , this is zero hour .
you simply don &apos;t want me to waste time giving you a long explanation .
no , but a husband is entitled to an inkling .
Siletsky wants me to have dinner with him ... if we don &apos;t get another idea ... maybe I &apos;ll have to kill him , because only I can get to him .
this wouldn &apos;t have happened if the Lieutenant arrived before Siletsky .
but they sent a plane for Siletsky , so he arrived before the Lieutenant .
- Is that clear ?
- No .
you &apos;re going to have dinner with him ?
that &apos;s our only chance .
I &apos;ll decide with whom my wife has dinner and whom she &apos;ll kill .
- Don &apos;t you see , Poland &apos;s at stake ?
- Have you no patriotism ?
first , you walk out of my soliloquy , and then you walk into my slippers .
and now you question my patriotism . I &apos;m a good Pole .
I love my country and my slippers .
- I hope your country comes first . - So do I .
- This is an emergency ...
- Look ...
I don &apos;t know much about the whole thing , but is Siletsky a real danger to Poland ?
- A catastrophe .
- He must be taken care of .
- And he will be taken care of .
- Who &apos;s going to do it ?
- I &apos;m going to do it .
- But how ?
where ?
I &apos;m going to meet Herr Siletsky at Gestapo Headquarters .
and after I &apos;ve killed him , I hope you tell me what it was all about .
it took a bit longer than I thought , I wonder if the effect was worth it .
I &apos;m willing to die for our Führer at any moment ...
- except for the next few hours .
- Thank you , Professor .
the last time I wore this gown ...
it seems like ages .
and I haven &apos;t seen such food . caviar , it still exists .
Yes , on the winning side .
I must admit , you put some very convincing arguments on this table .
it &apos;s nice being here , Professor .
I ordered a buffet . we don &apos;t want to be interrupted by orderlies .
naturally . after all , this isn &apos;t a fair State .
the best thing is to start your training as an agent ... with a glass of champagne .
shall we drink to a blitzkrieg ?
I prefer a slow encirclement .
you know , Professor , I &apos;m a little scared of you .
but why ? you shouldn &apos;t be .
maybe not .
maybe there &apos;s something very gentle under that beard of yours .
I think you might have a boyish quality , and yet I don &apos;t know .
- Why don &apos;t you find out ?
- I will .
here , write your name and I &apos;ll tell you everything about you .
the first time I saw my husband &apos;s handwriting ... was on the marriage certificate , then it was too late .
I &apos;m taking an awful chance .
but remember ... if a fortune-teller wants to stay in business ... she must only tell her client what he really wants to hear .
Professor , if I &apos;d known you made an &quot; S &quot; like that , I wouldn &apos;t have come here .
- You &apos;re a very determined man .
- Yes , very .
but you have great charm , yes .
I only hope you live up to that &quot; Y , &quot; Professor .
you &apos;ll see .
- Heil Hitler .
- Heil Hitler .
Heil Hitler .
I am Capt. Muhm , Colonel Ehrhardt &apos;s staff .
please come in .
just a moment .
I &apos;m sorry , there &apos;s been a change in Colonel Ehrhardt &apos;s plans .
he &apos;d like to see you immediately .
Yes , of course .
I &apos;ll be with you in a minute .
- I &apos;m so sorry .
- Don &apos;t tell me you have to leave .
Yes , but I &apos;ll make it as quickly as possible .
that &apos;s terrible .
I came up here with such doubts in my mind ... and now you &apos;re going to leave me here just as the cause is getting me .
I won &apos;t be long .
Gestapo is so busy these days , I &apos;m sure they &apos;ll be glad to get rid of me .
- I &apos;m so sorry .
- Well , it can &apos;t be helped .
just a moment . what &apos;s your name ?
- Mrs. Tura .
- Whom were you visiting ?
Professor Siletsky .
I &apos;m sorry . Professor left no instructions .
you &apos;ll have to wait until he comes back .
- But that &apos;s impossible . - Sorry .
there is nothing I can do about it . - 206 .
- Yes , sir .
Yes , sir .
- Heil Hitler . - Heil Hitler .
wait one moment , I &apos;ll announce you to Colonel Ehrhardt .
Goodbye , Colonel .
- Heil Hitler . - Heil Hitler .
isn &apos;t this the gentleman from England , Captain ?
- Yes , General .
- It &apos;s a pleasure to meet you , Professor .
a very great pleasure .
you certainly fooled the English , didn &apos;t you ?
the British lion will drink his tea ... from saucers made in Germany .
- Heil Hitler . - Heil Hitler .
how did he ever become a general ?
he &apos;s Göring &apos;s brother-in-law .
- I &apos;ll announce you to the Colonel . - Thank you .
he brought the papers with him . now remember .
who were his helpers in England ?
- When you find out call me , I &apos;ll do the rest . - All right .
- Tura , you &apos;re playing for our lives .
I &apos;m going to do the impossible .
I &apos;m going to surpass myself . don &apos;t .
take it easy and don &apos;t draw out the scene please .
come on , let &apos;s go .
I hate to leave the fate of my country in the hands of a ham .
send him in .
- Professor , please . - Thank you .
- Heil Hitler . - Heil Hitler .
Professor Siletsky , I &apos;m glad to see you .
and I &apos;m glad to see you , too . - Sit down , please .
- Thank you very much .
I can &apos;t tell you how delighted we are to have you .
may I say , my dear Colonel , that it &apos;s good to breathe the air of the Gestapo again .
you know , you &apos;re quiet famous in London , Colonel .
they call you &quot; Concentration Camp &quot; Ehrhardt . Yes .
we do the concentrating , and the Poles do the camping .
Yes , indeed . well , here &apos;s the report ... and that &apos;s the end of the underground movement .
let &apos;s see this .
excellent .
they &apos;re as good as dead .
I assume , there are no supplementary documents still at the hotel .
- No , that covers everything . - Good .
and I &apos;m sending the duplicate to Berlin the first thing in the morning .
the duplicate ? Yes , of course , the duplicate .
if you ask me , it &apos;s a lot of red tape .
but since they want it , well , all right . naturally .
you know , Professor ...
Warsaw is a dangerous place these days .
but I suppose you have the papers in the hotel safe ?
no , they &apos;re locked in my trunk . the whole hotel is a safe .
Yes , of course .
naturally .
I want to get the machinery started on this report right away .
- I &apos;ll be back in a moment . - Very well .
- All right , I &apos;ll get this wrapped up . - No .
he still has papers in his trunk .
papers in his trunk ?
I &apos;ll kill that dirty dog any how .
how are we going to get into his hotel ?
get back there and keep him there . we &apos;ll try to figure something out .
Colonel , is there anything else you want to ask me ? lots .
sit down , Professor .
there are many things I want to ask you .
so many things .
anything you want to know , I &apos;d only be too happy to oblige . thank you .
so they call me &quot; Concentration Camp &quot; Ehrhardt ?
you know , Professor ...
- there &apos;s something I wanted to ask you . - Yes ?
that &apos;s the way it is . a thousand questions on your mind ... yet you can &apos;t think of anything to ask .
but it will crystallize .
maybe there &apos;s something you like to ask me ?
no , I can &apos;t think of anything , Colonel .
so they call me &quot; Concentration Camp &quot; Ehrhardt .
well . excuse me a minute , I &apos;ll be right back .
- I &apos;m running out of dialogue .
- We got it .
- Put this gun in your pocket .
- Take him to the hotel .
as soon as you &apos;re in his room , hit his head with the butt of the gun .
then , take his keys , open his trunk and burn the papers .
then you shoot him .
all right . just a minute .
what &apos;ll happen to me ? they &apos;ll kill me .
- We &apos;re going to keep our fingers crossed .
- Good .
wait a minute .
you go to the hotel and I &apos;ll cross my fingers .
here , think of something else .
so they really call me &quot; Concentration Camp &quot; Ehrhardt ?
Colonel , unless there &apos;s something urgent , I &apos;d like to relax a little .
relax ? Oh , Mrs. Tura .
tell me , how is Mrs. Tura ? sit down , Professor .
you see , my Gestapo men are very efficient .
I simply thought she might be of some value to us as an agent .
and besides that , she &apos;s very good company .
very good company ?
Colonel , if you &apos;d like to meet Mrs. Tura , I &apos;d be glad to introduce you .
well , thank you .
and if you happen to take a liking to the lady ...
maybe you &apos;ll even put in a good word for me ?
I &apos;d be delighted .
well , thank you .
- Tell me , hasn &apos;t she a husband ?
- Yes , but what does it matter ?
Yes , what does it ?
by the way , I believe her husband is that great Polish actor ...
Joseph Tura . of course , you &apos;ve heard of him ?
no , I haven &apos;t .
as a matter of fact , I never even heard of Maria Tura before , either .
you didn &apos;t ? then how did you get in touch with her ?
it &apos;s rather a delicate story .
there &apos;s a young Polish flier in England , I think his name is Sobinski .
- Asked me to deliver a message to her .
- Well ... that &apos;s very interesting . what was the message ?
I had to swear to this young Romeo not to tell the husband .
that gives you a rough idea of the message .
Yes .
- It is a little rough .
- Seems they have a secret love code .
- Am I boring you ?
- No , I find it very interesting .
this flier gave me the message , and I couldn &apos;t make head nor tail of it ... and neither will you .
but Mrs. Tura seemed to understand it perfectly .
well , what was the message ?
- &quot; To be or not to be . &quot;
- To be ...
- To be or not to be !
- Colonel , it &apos;s nothing alarming ...
- it &apos;s only Shakespeare .
- That &apos;s what you think .
Professor Siletsky , you amaze me .
you , a Gestapo man , bringing a message to a Polish woman from the enemy .
and when I say enemy , I mean enemy !
you think they had a romance ?
I couldn &apos;t swear to it , but I don &apos;t doubt it . do you ?
no !
and I &apos;m going to find out if I have to mobilize the whole Gestapo .
but , Colonel , I don &apos;t understand ... suppose these two did have a romance , that &apos;s nothing you have to worry about .
the only person that has to worry is the husband .
and that &apos;s enough ! I &apos;m going to arrest this Maria Tura .
I guess you &apos;re right , Professor .
I &apos;ve been with the Gestapo so long ...
- I get suspicious of everyone .
- And so do I .
so they call me &quot; Concentration Camp &quot; Ehrhardt .
- Coming back to Mrs. Tura .
- Let &apos;s forget about her .
there &apos;s nothing mysterious about her , she &apos;s just a cheap , little ...
I think I know what you mean .
then I don &apos;t have to say it , do I ?
do you mind if I &apos;m repetitious , Colonel Ehrhardt ?
why ? no , not at all .
as I said before , Colonel Ehrhardt ... the only one that has to worry about all this is the lady &apos;s husband .
that great Polish actor , Joseph Tura .
- Well , that &apos;s none of my concern .
- But it should be , Mr. Tura .
raise your hands , quickly , please .
- Did you ever play a corpse , Mr. Tura ?
- What ?
you &apos;re going to be one unless you do exactly as I say .
get to the door and tell your friends to clear away from there .
I won &apos;t do it .
turn around . get over there and face that wall .
now , stay there .
sure you won &apos;t change your mind ? I &apos;ll give you one more chance .
farewell , Mr. Tura .
long live Poland !
- What happened ?
- I don &apos;t know , he must have gone out .
there he is !
get him !
get backstage . raise the curtain .
- Heil Hitler .
- Heil Hitler .
- Professor Siletsky .
- Professor Siletsky isn &apos;t here .
- You expect him back ?
- Yes , certainly .
do you mind if I wait here for the Professor ?
no , not at all .
thank you .
- Good night , Professor Siletsky .
- Good night .
- Good night , Professor .
- Good night .
- Professor Siletsky ?
- Yes ?
- Heil Hitler .
- Heil Hitler .
I &apos;m Capt. Schultz of Colonel Ehrhardt &apos;s staff .
well , I &apos;m glad to meet you , Captain .
Mrs. Tura .
I thought you had left , Madame .
you forgot to leave word for me to get out ... but now I don &apos;t regret that I &apos;ve waited .
and how is Professor Siletsky ?
dead . absolutely dead .
I had to take care of some business . how about a glass of champagne ?
no , thank you . I don &apos;t drink .
- Cigarette ?
- Thank you . I don &apos;t smoke .
- Just like our Führer .
- Yes .
well , Captain , I &apos;m terribly sorry to have kept you waiting .
I tried to entertain the Captain , but he seems to be the suspicious type .
I admit I was a little surprised when I came in .
and I don &apos;t blame you .
here the whole Gestapo has been working for a long time , day and night ... trying to find out every little thing about everybody ... and I arrive , and in a few hours I find the most attractive lady in town .
you didn &apos;t know Madame before ?
well , no . not exactly . but the explanation is very simple .
I just asked Mrs. Tura here to deliver a message .
- Isn &apos;t that right ?
- Yes .
there &apos;s a young flier , a very good friend of the Turas ... and particularly of Mrs. Tura .
Yes . but he &apos;s no particular friend of mine .
nevertheless , a friend . it was a code message .
code message ?
Mrs. Tura has nothing to hide from the Gestapo ... but she has one tiny little secret .
if her husband ever found out , he would murder her .
by the way , he is that great Polish actor , Joseph Tura .
- You &apos;ve probably heard of him ?
- No , I haven &apos;t .
Professor , Colonel Ehrhardt ... Yes .
I &apos;m going to meet him promptly , 10 : 00 tomorrow morning .
there has been a change in the Colonel &apos;s plans .
you &apos;re not going to take him away ?
I &apos;m sorry . but the Colonel is expecting the Professor now .
those are my orders .
well , it looks like I &apos;ll have to go . excuse me a moment .
sweetheart .
darling .
open the trunk . burn all the papers .
- All right . what did you do with Siletsky ?
- What did you do with Sobinski ?
that &apos;s unimportant now , don &apos;t you realize ... you &apos;re going into the hands of the Gestapo ?
Yes , the scene is loaded with dynamite . one little slip and I &apos;m a dead man .
you know I &apos;m never any good unless I have my peace of mind .
Maria , be honest , be frank . I &apos;ve got to know .
did you tell that fellow to walk out of my soliloquy ?
sweetheart , darling , I love you .
don &apos;t you know that ?
don &apos;t you feel it ? if anything happened to you ...
you think I can do it ?
you &apos;re a great actor . nobody can play it but you .
you can , and you will do it .
Goodbye , darling .
Goodbye .
if I shouldn &apos;t come back , I forgive what happened between you and Sobinski .
but if I come back , it &apos;s a different matter .
- Yes ?
- Heil Hitler . - Heil Hitler .
- Professor Siletsky is here .
have him come in .
didn &apos;t you understand what I told you ?
did you arrest him ? why not ? you have no proof ?
now , that &apos;s a fine excuse . arrest him , too .
whenever in doubt , arrest him .
how many times do I have to tell you , arrest him ? Heil Hitler .
- Heil Hitler .
- Heil Hitler .
Professor , at last we meet .
please make yourself at home . won &apos;t you take off your coat ?
thank you . Colonel Ehrhardt ...
I can &apos;t tell you how happy I am to breathe the air of the Gestapo again .
thank you very much . cigarette , cigar , glass of brandy ?
no , thank you .
there was a sudden change in my schedule .
confidentially , big news .
a very old friend of yours is coming to Warsaw . the Führer .
I know you will be delighted to see the Führer again .
- Who wouldn &apos;t ? - That &apos;s right .
how long since you &apos;ve seen him , Professor ?
- Too long . much too long .
- Of course .
tell me , is Berchtesgaden really as beautiful as they say it is ?
Yes , I think I can say that without any risk .
but it isn &apos;t the architecture or the landscaping ... it &apos;s the presence of the Führer that lends the real beauty to the place .
naturally . well , what news you bring from London ?
London ? Oh , yes , London .
Colonel , you &apos;re quiet famous in London .
you know what they call you ? &quot; concentration Camp &quot; Ehrhardt .
they do , do they ?
so they call me &quot; Concentration Camp &quot; Ehrhardt .
I thought you would react just that way .
well , Professor , let &apos;s have your information .
I think I can stand a glass of brandy , after all .
certainly . brandy .
that makes me think of a very funny story which is going all over Warsaw .
a story about our Führer . now , how does it go ?
Yes . they named a brandy after Napoleon .
they made a herring out of Bismarck .
and the Führer &apos;s going to end up as a piece of cheese .
don &apos;t you think it &apos;s funny ?
no . neither would the Führer .
I don &apos;t believe Adolf Hitler will go down in history as a delicatessen .
Professor , I was only joking , just repeating what I heard .
after all , I &apos;ll never ...
please don &apos;t misunderstand me .
- See , I &apos;m loyal . Heil Hitler .
- Heil Hitler .
Professor , do you intend to tell the Führer about this ?
- Why should I ruin you ?
- Of course , that &apos;s very nice .
I can promise you the Führer will never hear it from my lips .
- My word of honor .
- Thank you .
please , Professor , if you &apos;d be so kind , what about the underground movement ?
- What exactly are your plans ?
- You want to know ?
Yes , if you don &apos;t mind .
I have the key in my hand , all I have to find is the lock .
it &apos;s better having the lock than the key . how does it sound ?
promising . most promising .
but tell me , what exactly do you intend to do ?
- Well , let &apos;s get down to details .
- Yes , if you please .
there are no details . at least , not yet .
the important thing is ...
I have the name of the leader of the whole underground movement .
- If we play our cards right and carefully ...
- I understand .
if you watch the shepherd , you &apos;re bound to find the flock .
- What &apos;s the name of the shepherd ?
- Boguslaw Revanski .
send Capt. Schultz in .
so , they call me &quot; Concentration Camp &quot; Ehrhardt ?
Capt. Schultz , there &apos;s a man in this town ...
- What &apos;s his name ?
- Revanski .
- You mean , Bogoslov Revanski ?
- Yes .
- You don &apos;t have to worry about him .
- What ?
we shot him two days ago .
Revanski shot ? I refuse to believe it .
don &apos;t you realize whom you shot , Capt. Schultz ?
I tried to get the key man of the underground movement ... and just when we were ready ...
it &apos;s sabotage !
I resent that , Professor .
why did you shoot him ?
we have proof that this man was telling some outrageous stories about the Führer .
- That &apos;s no reason to shoot him .
- I agree with you .
at least not right away .
you shot Revanski like that .
would it have been better to look him over first ?
why don &apos;t we look over people before we shoot them ?
I &apos;m sorry , but you signed the order of execution yourself .
I sign so many every day .
I can &apos;t rely on my own people anymore .
please , Colonel , maybe we can still save the situation .
there &apos;s one other man . a possibility . a good possibility .
Maximilian Pietrowski .
Maximilian Pietrowski ?
don &apos;t tell me you ...
Yes .
Colonel , all I can say is , you can &apos;t have your cake and shoot it , too .
it can &apos;t be done .
if they hear about this in England , they &apos;ll give you the Victoria Cross .
- I resent that , Professor .
- That &apos;s all , Schultz .
Yes , sir .
I didn &apos;t like the way Capt. Schultz shifted the responsibility back to you .
neither did I. There &apos;s always something wrong ... with a man who doesn &apos;t drink , smoke , or eat meat .
- You mean our Führer ?
- No , please , Professor .
- Hope you won &apos;t ...
- Why should I ruin you again ?
thank you so much .
I suppose you want to go back as soon as possible to London .
- London ? Yes , certainly .
- When did you plan to leave ?
- I &apos;d like to get out as soon as possible .
- Under the circumstances , that &apos;s best .
we have a plane leaving on Thursday for Sweden .
- I &apos;ll make a reservation for you .
- That &apos;s fine .
- Better make that two reservations .
- Two ? my trip was successful in one respect . I made a discovery .
a certain Mrs. Tura .
she &apos;ll be the most valuable assistant I &apos;ve ever had .
- Frankly , I don &apos;t believe in women agents .
- You &apos;ll change your mind if you meet her .
why don &apos;t you ? form your own opinion ?
if you say &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s no .
I &apos;ll call you at the hotel . what was the lady &apos;s name ?
Mrs. Tura .
her husband is that great Polish actor , Joseph Tura .
- You &apos;ve probably heard of him ?
- Yes . I saw him on the stage when I was in Warsaw , before the War .
really ?
what he did to Shakespeare , we are doing now to Poland .
- Goodbye , Colonel .
- Goodbye , Professor .
I &apos;m Colonel Ehrhardt . will you sit down , please ?
- Mrs. Tura , I sent for you .
- I &apos;m very grateful .
I can &apos;t make up my mind .
Yes , it sounds very intriguing and exciting ...
Mrs. Tura , I have bad news for you .
if you don &apos;t think I &apos;m the right person ... it will be disappointing , but the cause must come first .
no , Mrs. Tura . it isn &apos;t that .
prepare yourself for a shock .
Professor Siletsky is dead .
- Dead ?
- Murdered .
I can &apos;t believe it . it can &apos;t be .
- When did this happen ?
- We haven &apos;t found out yet .
I only got the report just now .
- Was it at the hotel ?
- No . he was evidently trapped somewhere .
the Führer has just arrived in Warsaw .
the men are planning a great reception ... for him tonight .
a performance by the soldiers .
they opened the Theatre Polski .
they tried to arrange some scenery .
one of the props broke and out fell the body of Professor Siletsky .
who could have done such a thing ? have you any idea ?
we &apos;re certain , the bullet found in his body came from a British service revolver .
yesterday , the British landed someone here by parachute .
so the only mystery left is , where is this man ?
believe me , we &apos;re going to get him .
- I hope so .
- My poor Professor .
I had an appointment with him this afternoon .
he was due here any minute .
thank you very much .
I won &apos;t take up any more of your time . Goodbye .
Mrs. Tura , I want you to know that your ties with us are not broken .
- You might be very valuable to us .
- Thank you .
it doesn &apos;t have to be London . I might have something here in Warsaw .
Colonel , whatever you decide , if you want me ...
naturally , I would have to know you a little better .
that is my duty and if I may say , my pleasure .
that &apos;s nice of you , Colonel .
- But at the moment ...
- It doesn &apos;t have to be today .
when you feel a little better , maybe we can have dinner together .
- Why don &apos;t you let me know ?
- I will .
and don &apos;t take it too hard , little woman .
- I &apos;ll try not to .
- That &apos;s the spirit .
Mrs. Tura seems to be rather upset .
naturally , it &apos;s very unfortunate what happened to Siletsky .
- After all , he died for the Führer .
- Naturally .
Hello . good morning , Professor Siletsky . I have ...
you will be a little late .
Yes , I understand .
will you please announce me to Professor Siletsky ?
- The Professor left quite a while ago .
- He did ? thank you .
- Was Tura here ?
- Yeah .
- Did he say anything ?
- He just rushed in ... punched me in the jaw , and rushed out .
- Dobosh , you know what happened ? - Yes .
it &apos;s all right , Joseph just left .
- What do you mean ?
- He had trouble .
somebody must have grabbed his beard .
I fixed it up and gave him an extra beard .
just in case . you can &apos;t tell with Tura .
he &apos;s lost . they found the body in the theater .
- They know everything .
- What ?
- Who opened the theater ?
- The Nazis .
- Who gave them the key ?
- You idiot you , shut up !
they &apos;re gonna kill him . you &apos;ve got to do something . help him .
Rawitch , do something .
everything is all right .
- The Professor is here .
- We will be delighted .
Professor , please .
- Heil Hitler .
- Heil Hitler . how is the Professor ?
- Fine , thank you . how is the Colonel ?
- Excellent . may I ?
tell me , Colonel , what was your impression of Mrs. Tura ?
- Wonderful .
- I &apos;m glad you feel that way .
Yes , indeed .
this is Capt. Mueller and It .
Brundt of our Special Investigation Squad .
or what we call the Hotfoot Department .
- How do you do ?
- It &apos;s a pleasure .
I think we should have a good talk before you leave .
I have to take up a few things with these gentlemen .
would you mind stepping into my living room ?
he should have cracked by now .
give him a little time . let him enjoy his goose pimples .
Colonel , do you really prefer this procedure to our usual methods ?
I would say with intellectuals , the mental approach is more effective ... and much quicker .
but if he shouldn &apos;t turn out to be an intellectual ?
then we try a little physical culture .
I don &apos;t want to hurry you , but do you think it will be much longer ?
- Did you get bored ?
- No , I tried to open up a conversation ... with your friend in there , but he seems to be dead .
no . really . let &apos;s go and see .
it looks like murder .
if I &apos;m wrong , Colonel , please correct me .
there seems to be a slight resemblance between me and your late friend .
- Has that struck you , too ?
- Definitely .
I have a terrible suspicion that one of us must be an imposter .
now that you mention it , I think you &apos;re right .
now , just for fun , Colonel , which one of us do you think is the imposter ?
I hope you won &apos;t consider it impolite , Professor ... but there &apos;s a general feeling in this room that it &apos;s you .
please forgive me .
- Certainly . you mind if I play detective ?
- Go right ahead , Professor Siletsky .
thank you .
- Edmondson &apos;s London .
- The real Siletsky came from London .
the suit was bought in London .
- You think it looks bad for me ?
- Terrible .
his watch is still running .
which means he was killed , since the real Professor Siletsky arrived in ...
this really looks bad for me . I &apos;m liable to get shot .
there &apos;s a distinct possibility .
there &apos;s no doubt there was a definite purpose .
- He wanted to look like me ...
- Or you wanted to look like him .
that &apos;s right .
our hair is cut alike and even the shape of our beards is somewhat similar .
not similar . exactly alike .
- How long did you know each other ?
- I just meet him here .
now you &apos;re lying .
plain lying . you must have observed him for months .
it takes that long to grow a beard of that kind .
- Very good , Schultz .
- Excellent , Schultz .
except you forget I may be wearing a false beard .
very funny .
no , Professor . I &apos;ll tell you a better story .
- Maybe he is wearing a false beard .
- I hardly think so .
why don &apos;t you convince yourself ?
why don &apos;t you pull his beard ?
- I can &apos;t do it .
- No , you can &apos;t .
too sensitive . you can murder a man , kill in cold blood ... but you cannot pull a man &apos;s beard !
I can &apos;t believe it .
how dare you put me in this position ?
I can &apos;t rely on anybody .
- You gave the order yourself ...
- Shifting the responsibility on me again ?
that &apos;s all , Schultz . Bye-bye , gentlemen .
- Professor , I don &apos;t know how to apologize .
- You were only doing your duty .
if there &apos;s a slightest doubt in your mind , why don &apos;t you pull my beard ?
- Please , Professor .
no . - Come on . just once .
don &apos;t rub it in .
I assure you , I never believed it for one minute ... but this Schultz ...
and , Professor , if you see the Führer ...
you &apos;d appreciate it if I didn &apos;t tell him .
- I won &apos;t tell .
- Thank you so much .
now , the important thing is to get you to London as quickly as possible .
- With Mrs. Tura ?
- Of course . anything you say , Professor .
- Get me the airport .
- Where &apos;s Colonel Ehrhardt &apos;s office ?
- Heil Hitler . Colonel Ehrhardt ?
- Yes , sir .
I &apos;m in charge of the Führer &apos;s Safety Squad .
I ride with the Führer this morning , and in one hour ...
I uncover a plot against his life . can &apos;t I rely on anyone ?
- But , General ...
- Arrest this man .
- No , General .
- This man &apos;s an imposter .
- Are you crazy ?
- He is Professor Siletsky .
what do you have to say for yourself now ?
here is a man with a beard , and you didn &apos;t even pull it .
I never saw a more gross neglected duty in my life .
- General ...
- I &apos;ve no confidence in you anymore .
I &apos;m taking charge of this case myself .
there will be a reorganization here , and your head will not be spared .
- And furthermore ...
- General , may I remind you ... of your appointment with the Führer ?
Yes . you &apos;ll hear from me .
take him out .
piece of cheese ?
Schultz !
I had a plane arranged , but Mr. Rawitch had a burning desire to act again .
when Mr. Rawitch acts , someone has to suffer .
please , Mr. Tura . forgive me for trying to save your life .
who really bust the whole thing up ?
if you hadn &apos;t been so stupid ...
- and jealous of your wife .
- I hope it &apos;s true .
- But it isn &apos;t .
- We &apos;ll talk about that later .
- Friends ...
- Romans and countrymen .
we know you want to play Mark Antony , but that doesn &apos;t help us .
in 24 hours , they &apos;ll know everything .
then we &apos;re caught like rats in a trap .
just a moment .
Hitler , of course , will be sitting in the royal box tonight .
you remember two years ago , we played Murder in The Opera House ?
- It was a flop .
- It might be again .
but we have to take the chance to get out of here .
the situation is very similar .
there &apos;ll be soldiers in the corridor ... guarding Hitler &apos;s box .
if we can get them away for just one second ...
that means we need a confusion , a commotion among the Gestapo .
I have started a commotion on every Gestapo man I &apos;ve met .
no , we can &apos;t use you . there &apos;ll be no ladies .
Greenberg .
Yes , Mr. Dobosh .
if we can manage that Greenberg suddenly pops up among the Nazis ...
- It &apos;ll get a terrific laugh .
- No , it won &apos;t .
Greenberg , you always wanted to play an important part .
- What do I have to do , Mr. Dobosh ?
- If you don &apos;t play it right , we &apos;re all lost .
and if you do play it right , I still can &apos;t guarantee anything .
- What do I have to do ?
- All right , let &apos;s rehearse .
- How does it look ?
- Excellent .
Sobinski , it &apos;s time to go .
- I &apos;m ready .
- Let &apos;s see .
- Looks all right .
- Yes . he looks very good .
- I &apos;ll pick you up about 9 : 00 .
- Oh , darling . Goodbye .
if anything should go wrong , if you shouldn &apos;t come back ...
- Then Sobinski won &apos;t come back either .
- Goodbye , darling .
I guess you want to say goodbye . go ahead .
this may be the last time we &apos;ll see each other .
I can only say it was wonderful knowing you , Maria .
- Goodbye , Mrs. Tura .
- Goodbye , Mr. Sobinski .
- Heil the Führer .
- Heil .
- How did you get here ?
- I was born here .
- What made you decide to die here ?
- Him .
- What do you want from the Führer ?
- What does he want from us ?
what does he want from Poland ? why all this ? why ?
&quot; aren &apos;t we human ?
have we not eyes ? have we not hands ...
&quot; organs , senses , dimensions , affections , passions ?
&quot; fed with the same food , hurt with the same weapons ...
&quot; subject to the same diseases , healed by the same means ...
&quot; cooled and warmed by the same winter and summer .
&quot; if you prick us , do we not bleed ?
&quot; if you tickle us , do we not laugh ?
&quot; if you poison us , do we not die ?
&quot; if you wrong us , shall we not revenge ? &quot;
- Lieutenants Lange and Schneider .
- Yes , sir .
take charge of him and bring him to my headquarters .
I want to question him .
men , I don &apos;t want a word to leak out about this incredible incident .
- Who &apos;s in charge here ?
- I am , sir .
how could this have happened ?
- I don &apos;t know , sir .
- You don &apos;t know .
that &apos;s just it . that &apos;s how you safeguard our Führer .
my Führer , it is my duty to advise you to leave immediately .
to the airport . we have to make a stop on the way .
I &apos;ll tell you where .
Greenberg , he always wanted to play Shylock .
and he got his chance at last .
and he &apos;ll play it again .
not in the corridor , but on the stage of the Polski theater .
- The railroad station .
- The underground is still alive .
Yes . we saved the underground .
Bronski , now we belong to history .
- They might even erect a monument to us .
I can see myself sitting on a horse for the next century .
Yes , and sometimes when ...
- What &apos;s the matter ?
- Nothing . I am such a nervous wreck , I &apos;m imagining things .
- Imagining what ?
- I thought you were wearing a mustache .
- I am .
- No , you &apos;re not .
are you crazy ?
where &apos;s my mustache ? this is a catastrophe .
we &apos;ve got to find it .
I can &apos;t get out without it . I &apos;ve got to get Maria .
- What did you do with it ?
- My mustache !
we got to find it .
good evening , Mrs. Tura .
I suppose you &apos;re surprised to see us ?
I &apos;m delighted , gentlemen , but unfortunately I have an appointment .
we have several things we want to find out .
couldn &apos;t I see you tomorrow at your office ?
no , I &apos;m sorry . it is very urgent .
the Colonel and I were talking things over .
Mrs. Tura , we consider you a women of enormous appeal .
thank you . but what &apos;s so very urgent about that ?
it struck me as rather peculiar why anybody like you could be ...
- attracted to Professor Siletsky .
- You never can tell about those things .
for instance , you &apos;re attractive yourself .
perhaps my taste is a little peculiar .
but I haven &apos;t Professor Siletsky &apos;s distinguished beard .
- That &apos;s what fascinated you so much .
- Yes , it did intrigue me .
brought out the child in me .
I always felt like pulling it , but I didn &apos;t .
- What do you mean by that ?
- It was a false beard , you know that .
he fooled me and he certainly fooled you , Colonel .
how do you know all this ?
- Gen. Von Seidelman .
- What do you know about him ?
he asked me to his office , and I had to answer a million questions .
he thanked me for the information and ...
gentlemen , do you by any chance suspect me ?
- Mrs. Tura ...
- General thought everything was all right .
if Gen. Von Seidelman thinks it &apos;s all right , then it is all right .
- What are you trying to get me into now ?
- Colonel , it was your own idea .
Shifting the responsibility on me again .
- Good night , Schultz .
- Good night , Colonel .
this Schultz ! Oh , Mrs. Tura , I &apos;m so sorry .
I don &apos;t like to be impolite , but I have an appointment .
I &apos;ll drive you there .
you don &apos;t understand . someone is coming .
- Someone is coming here .
- If he should find you ...
I am here on official business . there is nothing to worry about .
Mrs. Tura , consider yourself in the arms of the Gestapo .
- Colonel , I &apos;m a married woman .
- But you &apos;re expecting someone .
- Now I have to stay here .
- Colonel ...
I have to protect your husband .
- No , Colonel , you mustn &apos;t do this .
- Mrs. Tura , I &apos;ll give you a bracelet .
- I confiscated a beautiful one today .
- I don &apos;t want a bracelet .
I can make life worth living for you .
I can give you extra butter rations .
I &apos;ll give you three eggs a week .
I don &apos;t want any eggs . Colonel , please go .
Maria .
- Why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
- How could I ? don &apos;t you understand ?
haven &apos;t you any tact ?
my Führer !
Schultz !
gentlemen , the Führer wants to talk to both of you himself .
the Lieutenant will take the control .
- Yes , mein Führer .
- Jump .
- Heil Hitler .
- Heil Hitler .
two very obliging fellows .
now let &apos;s go to England .
first it was Hess , now it &apos;s him .
everybody , a nice smile . thank you .
and you , Mr. Tura .
you played the real hero in this amazing play .
I did my best and I was very ably assisted by my colleagues .
thank you , my friends , for everything you did .
as little as it may have been .
I am sure England will want to show its gratitude .
what do you desire most , Mr. Tura ?
- Well , I ...
- He wants to play Hamlet .
after all , we are in the country of William Shakespeare ...
he wants to play Hamlet .
&quot; than is my deed to my most painted word .
&quot; O heavy burden ! &quot;
&quot; I hear him coming . let &apos;s withdraw , my Lord . &quot;
&quot; to be or not to be . &quot;
the DEVIL &apos;S ENVOYS
... and so , in the lovely month of May , 1485 , the Devil sent two of his envoys to this world to drive humans to despair ...
there it is .
tell me , my good man .
would the lord of this castle welcome two minstrels who &apos;ve traveled far to entertain him ?
- I believe so .
you &apos;re in luck .
Baron Hugues loves music and soon Miss Anne will be wed to Sir Renaud .
since the engagement , it &apos;s been banquet after banquet .
in festive times , my skills aren &apos;t needed , so I fish to pass the time .
thank you , good man .
no , let me thank you for calling me &quot; good man &quot; !
in spite of everything , it &apos;s nice to hear !
come to me , pretty frogs !
make up your minds !
afraid of the executioner ?
then come to the &quot; good man &quot; !
my lords !
kind lords !
how heavy is my heart !
a beast who never hurt anyone , a beast who made the whole castle laugh !
he was just crossing the courtyard and the guards shot him , just for sport .
this is all I have left !
he &apos;s dead , kind lords .
he was my brother !
what will I do ?
Woe is me !
- Why bother , Gilles ?
- I enjoy doing good sometimes .
why bother ?
these performers are putting me to sleep .
let &apos;s hope this one is more entertaining .
you &apos;re hard to please . I found the juggler quite amusing .
he has a sad face .
father , isn &apos;t his face sad ?
- Shall I throw him out ?
- I don &apos;t wish to cause him harm .
it &apos;d be a shame to lose such a face . I agree !
his hollow cheeks make me hungry ! stand up .
show us what you can do .
nothing myself , noble lord , but I can display three extremely rare creatures .
few have ever seen them .
Commoners are naive and easily frightened .
only the great can properly appreciate these oddities of nature .
you &apos;re too sensitive , Anne . take a look .
I assure you , they &apos;re very funny .
I don &apos;t want to .
look , just to make me happy .
then look back at me . you &apos;ll only love me more .
I don &apos;t want to see them . I feel sorry for them .
take them away .
I don &apos;t want you to be sad , dear child .
these banquets are to make you happy .
think you &apos;re pretty enough to mock them ?
I &apos;m no beauty , but compared to them , I must seem pretty !
I believe my daughter would like to hear sweet things that touch the heart .
stories of romance , the yearnings of simple hearts .
are there any singers in the hall ?
demons and marvels
winds and waves
far away already
and you Like seaweed
Caressed by the wind
in the dunes of your bed
you stir in your sleep
demons and marvels
winds and waves
far away already
but in your half-open eyes
two little waves
demons and marvels
winds and waves
two little waves
to drown myself in
you sing well , young man . who are you ?
my name is Gilles .
this is my brother , Dominique .
sing us another song .
the tender and dangerous face of love
appeared to me one night after an endless day
perhaps it was an archer with his bow
perhaps a musician with his harp
I know no more
I know nothing
all I know
is that he wounded me
perhaps with an arrow
perhaps with a song
all I know
is that he wounded me
his shot hit my heart wounded forever
burning Ardently burning
this wound of love
with its little sighs and big deceits !
before , at least we had songs about war , hunting , the urge to fight , to kill .
you &apos;re too harsh , Renaud .
I might not have loved Baroness Berthe like in the songs , but she meant so much to me .
so much .
but my wife is dead and times have changed .
now everyone speaks of love . too much !
I don &apos;t like it .
you look proud of yourself .
how dare you gaze into a lady &apos;s eyes while crooning such nonsense ?
Renaud , please !
if I had you hung , would you sing as sweetly with a rope around your throat ?
I doubt it .
then sing no more if you value the pitiful thing you call your life !
your mind is elsewhere , Anne .
are you sad because of how I spoke of love ?
no , dear friend .
I &apos;m not angry with you .
you know , I also used to dance when Berthe was still alive .
my creatures are tired . where may they sleep ?
I &apos;ll show you the room reserved for the performers .
- What are you thinking of ?
- Nothing .
then who are you thinking of ?
did I ever give you reason for jealousy ?
fortunately , no .
I simply wish to remind you that soon you will be mine .
did you hear me ?
- Yes , Renaud .
your every pleasure , desire , even sorrow , if you have any , should be given to me .
may I at least dream ?
as little as possible !
dreams are dangerous and useless .
I never dream myself .
as soon as I saw you , I knew why I &apos;d traveled so far .
I thanked Heaven for leading me to you .
as soon as I saw you , I knew you &apos;d come for me .
I knew it .
I &apos;m sure my life will change .
do you regret it ?
no .
will you regret it ?
never .
even if it makes me suffer .
those who love never suffer .
look at them .
do they suffer ?
no .
they feel marvelously alone , the moonlight shines on their love .
and those two star-gazers , what are they thinking of ?
nothing .
not even the stars .
they are together , in love .
they are happy .
and that solitary man .
so sad , so hopeless .
surely his beloved has left him , or he her , and so the moon , the stars , the birds , the very trees of this garden no longer exist for him .
he hears nothing , he sees nothing .
he &apos;s all alone .
his love is gone .
if you ever left me ,
I &apos;d be in despair , like him .
my page Guillaume , with Agnès ?
I didn &apos;t know they were in love .
they &apos;re not .
for them , it &apos;s a game .
they toy with love .
that &apos;s the one who truly loves Guillaume .
Louison ?
she hides and watches them .
she wants to cry .
she &apos;s ugly , no one loves her .
if she loves him , why is she ugly ?
it &apos;s not fair .
it makes me sad , too .
I don &apos;t want you to be sad tonight .
she &apos;s so pretty now !
it &apos;s nothing .
the devilish beauty of youth .
I don &apos;t believe in the Devil !
you &apos;re lucky .
my name is Anne .
Anne ... you &apos;re the most marvelous creature I ever met .
I &apos;m so happy .
I &apos;ll never forget you .
if this is just a dream ,
I hope I never wake up .
why do you laugh ?
isn &apos;t it funny ?
you just met me , and already , you say you love me .
time is unimportant .
I love you . that &apos;s just how it is .
how can I believe that ?
before , you had nothing but scorn for love .
&quot; before &quot; is already far away .
now you &apos;re near me .
that &apos;s what matters .
I must be dreaming !
where did you come from ?
who are you ?
who am I ?
you just said it .
a woman who &apos;s near you , in your arms .
come , Anne .
Renaud ?
with another woman ?
as soon as I saw you , I knew why I &apos;d traveled so far .
I thanked Heaven for leading me to you .
Alas , I must leave soon .
I don &apos;t want you to leave .
take this ring .
if we &apos;re ever apart , it will remind you of me .
your mind is elsewhere .
your thoughts also seem far away .
who gave you that chain ?
who gave you that ring ?
you &apos;re in a pitiful state .
Gilles and Dominique Dominique and Gilles
the Devil treats his children well If they obey him well
remember Remember
what &apos;s written is written !
you signed a pact with him !
Gilles and Dominique Dominique and Gilles
who pretend to love
remember
you must continue It &apos;s your destiny :
Seduction , Corruption , Villainy Then to leave in despair
those who believed your sweet whispers !
monsters .
always monsters .
we won &apos;t sleep tonight .
did you want to ?
- Don &apos;t laugh .
- Why not ?
if I find it amusing , what &apos;s wrong with that ?
you haven &apos;t given me much reason to laugh since we &apos;ve lived together .
be quiet !
why stir up long-dead things ?
who killed them ?
did I ?
did you ?
or both ?
who nipped in the bud Our story of love ?
enough !
you know we never really loved each other .
we &apos;d known too many before we met , played at love too many times .
- Be quiet !
why ?
remorse !
too bad . I &apos;ve heard it helps pass the time .
if I felt remorse , it might help , wouldn &apos;t it ?
but why would I ?
men have loved me , as they like to whisper in my ear .
I let them .
is it my fault if they wept , gave everything for me , even their lives ?
the young men were passionate , the old men crawled at my feet .
when did I ever cry or throw myself at your feet ?
you &apos;re different .
greedy , stubborn , proud .
you just want to be loved , to take without giving , to keep it all and leave .
like you !
you hunted me like a cat hunts a mouse .
but we &apos;re both cats , there is no mouse .
it &apos;s not our fault . we both thought we &apos;d caught a tender new victim .
two executioners , face to face and no one to torture !
how sad !
- Enough !
if you &apos;d truly loved me ,
if you &apos;d truly loved me ,
I , too , might have loved you .
go on .
scare me .
hit me .
kill me . slit my throat .
my handsome love .
what &apos;s the point ?
what is signed , is signed .
aren &apos;t we happy ?
others love us , they suffer for us .
we watch them and we go away .
a lovely trip and the Devil picks up the bill .
good night , Gilles .
want to know where I &apos;m going ?
I already know .
where will you spend the night ?
obviously !
it &apos;d be a shame to disturb her dreams .
such tender creatures should be wooed in daylight .
Baron Hugues !
what do you want at this hour , young man ?
how dare you knock at my door ?
I don &apos;t know , a sudden impulse .
don &apos;t be angry , even if you can &apos;t understand .
I &apos;m in grave danger .
I feel so alone , so helpless .
touch my heart .
feel how it pounds !
Alas , it &apos;s true , I belong to the weaker sex .
so weak !
you alone know my secret .
as soon as I saw you , I knew why I &apos;d traveled so far .
I thanked Heaven for leading me to you .
who are you ?
where did you come from ?
I abandoned everything to escape a terrible fate , but I &apos;m still so troubled .
I need help and advice .
how can I help you when I myself live in the past , in my memories ?
it &apos;s not good to live in the past .
I try to forget everything .
Alas , my brother is only my brother and I am so alone .
so am I , child .
when my wife died , I lost my desire to live .
how you must have loved her !
Yes .
we loved each other .
love is a beautiful thing .
it was long ago . I &apos;m old now .
don &apos;t say that .
if one is young at heart , that &apos;s true youth .
she &apos;s in her bed
she sleeps and dreams she is yours
you must make her wait
the more she waits The more she &apos;ll love you
the more she loves you The more she &apos;ll suffer !
what is your desire , now that I &apos;ve confided i n you ?
what is my desire ?
why ask such a question ?
what do I desire ?
I desire you , totally , completely , and you know it !
you &apos;re so blunt .
sorry to offend . perhaps it &apos;s no way to woo women , but I speak my mind .
I said you were blunt , not that I didn &apos;t like it .
too many who call themselves men tremble and sigh for their sweethearts .
and you said you don &apos;t know how to talk to women !
the way you talk , who &apos;d believe your wedding is so near ?
leave the wedding out of it .
it &apos;s cruel of you to remind me .
is it true that traditionally , the newlyweds &apos; chamber is prepared and left open well in advance of the wedding ?
Yes , that &apos;s our custom .
a lovely tradition . I &apos;d love to see the chamber .
how commendable , this bedroom awaiting a young couple destined for each other .
be quiet .
everything about it expresses peace and happiness .
peace ... happiness .
since I met you , they don &apos;t matter .
peace and happiness no longer matter to me .
it &apos;s a shame to rise so early when we &apos;re so happy in bed !
alone in bed , how can I be happy ? why alone ?
the castle &apos;s full of pretty girls .
take a look .
and my heart is yours
will we have the pleasure of Anne &apos;s company ? I doubt it .
my daughter doesn &apos;t enjoy hunting .
you seem troubled . did you sleep well ?
it &apos;s been years since that happened .
what a shame , for isn &apos;t night made for sleeping ?
did you sleep well , my lady ?
I had a marvelous night .
why so gloomy ? it &apos;s a joyous day .
why not invite those two minstrels whose songs you so appreciated ?
you didn &apos;t seem to appreciate them last night .
I can admit when I &apos;m wrong .
Agnès !
quickly , dress me !
how kind of you to join us ! it &apos;s a lovely surprise .
should not all your pleasures become mine ?
I hope you also know hunting songs .
we have songs for every hour of the day – and night .
that minstrel has a peculiar voice , doesn &apos;t he ?
he &apos;s young . he laughs like a child .
hunting is so sad .
I love birds ! don &apos;t worry . no bird shall be caught .
I promise . the birds are my friends , too .
it &apos;s strange , you show no fear or surprise at things that surprise others , that frighten them .
why be frightened ?
life is full of mysteries , isn &apos;t it ?
a bird , an apple , a beast , the sun , the trees in these woods ...
even us : we don &apos;t know from whence we come or where we go .
isn &apos;t that marvelous ?
the water is so sweet .
your lips are sweet , too .
I love you , Anne .
Gilles ! what &apos;s wrong ?
I don &apos;t know .
I was so happy , then suddenly , I thought of Renaud .
he also said , &quot; I love you , Anne . &quot;
but with the same hard voice in which he says :
&quot; I love my dogs . I love hunting . I love killing whatever flies or leaps . &quot;
&quot; I love you , Anne . you &apos;ll be mine forever . &quot;
forever .
is it possible for a person to totally belong to another ?
some call that love .
then is love like death ?
we no longer exist ? it &apos;s all over ?
if you love me , don &apos;t hurt me , don &apos;t lock me up , let me live !
love me as I love you – simply .
it &apos;s impossible !
what would your daughter say ?
and Renaud ? nothing . it is not their place to speak .
when I speak , people listen and remain silent !
I want – Do you hear me ?
I want you to take off these men &apos;s clothes .
- Right now ?
- What are you saying ?
nothing .
you speak , I remain silent . don &apos;t laugh .
I want them to bow to you in awe of your beauty when they see you in a dress .
see me in a dress ?
is that all you desire ?
why tempt a man whose life is over ?
do you cling , like ivy , to your memories ?
I implore you ...
how can you be so unfeeling ?
do you wish to make me unhappy ?
me ?
make you unhappy ?
since you &apos;re here , I feel 20 years younger .
I &apos;m a different man .
why do you blame me ?
I blame you for nothing , dear child .
I &apos;d lost my quarry , so I was looking for you .
like you , undoubtedly .
obviously , you wouldn &apos;t understand , but ...
Dominique , here with us , is a woman .
truly ?
truly .
she &apos;s in grave danger . she requested my protection .
only you and I know her secret .
truly ?
truly .
I hear our friends .
we &apos;d better join them .
what game are you playing ?
what do you mean ?
he kneeled , he kissed your hands .
don &apos;t I deserve homage ?
women like to please .
Dominique ! I &apos;m only teasing .
the baron was suspicious .
he questioned me and I answered .
- That &apos;s all .
- That &apos;s all ?
are you jealous of an old man ?
me , jealous ?
now do you believe that a person can totally belong to another ...
- Gilles . - ... without being unhappy ?
I &apos;m happy .
and you ?
me ?
why would I be happy ?
because I &apos;m here with you ?
because I held you in my arms ?
to me , that &apos;s happiness .
happiness !
how boring !
it &apos;s incredible , the only thought in such a pretty head , always the same thought :
happiness !
it &apos;s all so terribly absurd , tragic , monotonous and banal !
what &quot; Gilles &quot; ?
what do you want from &quot; Gilles &quot; ?
what does &quot; Gilles &quot; mean ?
maybe my name isn &apos;t even Gilles !
I beseech you ... don &apos;t laugh that way !
such a sad laugh !
would you rather I burst into tears or roll at your feet because you love me ?
I love you and I know you love me too .
listen carefully .
Anne , my friend ,
I don &apos;t love you .
be quiet . it &apos;s not true !
you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re saying !
please don &apos;t look at me that way .
is it my fault if I &apos;ve never loved ?
- Be quiet .
- Hush !
it isn &apos;t worth a single tear , it &apos;s nothing but a story invented to amuse the Devil .
believe me , no one loves anyone .
everyone pretends !
and happiness – since you believe it exists – might be , especially for you , to avoid those traps .
you &apos;re leaving ?
Yes .
if you knew how much I love you , you &apos;d have no choice but to love me .
I now reveal this secret , which previously , only Renaud and I knew .
a woman ?
remember , Baron ? I noticed this minstrel &apos;s &quot; peculiar &quot; voice .
they aren &apos;t minstrels .
they are of noble birth and deserve to be honored .
they &apos;ll dine at my table , and at the tournament , I &apos;ll wear their colors !
- Well said !
- Yes , truly .
curious story , isn &apos;t it ?
were you aware of it ?
- No . the young man didn &apos;t tell you this afternoon in the woods ?
did the young lady tell you last night in the garden ?
during their stay , it is your duty to amuse them .
an easy task , for they seem well-equipped to amuse us .
why are you so ill-humored ?
why have you suddenly recovered your desire to live ?
is it possible that Dominique is truly your sister ?
such an innocent question ...
answer me .
if Dominique were my sister , do you think I &apos;d squander my time and pleasure to travel with her ?
you love her ?
to speak truly , she is my only love .
why take such pleasure in seeing me suffer ?
why ?
I knew you loved me !
Alas !
we are under a spell and once it dissipates , you &apos;ll see me as I truly am , miserable and alone .
I love you !
I belong to the Devil .
I &apos;m among his friends .
if you love me , it &apos;s probably thanks to him .
why torture yourself like that ?
I believed myself utterly alone , yet since I &apos;ve found you ,
I &apos;m even more lost , more alone , more desperate .
to me , you are all the love in the world and all I can bring you is sorrow and despair .
hold me in your arms .
once more , tell me you love me .
you are so simple , so young ,
so sweet and so alive !
protect me .
teach me to live .
before I met you , I only pretended .
my heart was like ice .
my love , be happy and at peace .
my body is close to yours , your heart beats with mine , our bodies , our hearts are one .
nothing can ever separate us !
I love you .
and no one – Do you hear ?
no one can stop me from loving you !
what strange weather !
it &apos;s true !
you should &apos;ve moved your knight !
too late . I &apos;ve made my move .
what is it ?
a lord caught in the storm requests hospitality for the night .
excuse me , I must welcome this unexpected guest .
I &apos;m honored to welcome you to my home .
thank you .
- You come from afar ?
- Very far !
I &apos;m quite a traveler !
the storm caught me by surprise .
I don &apos;t fear lightning , but getting soaked to the skin is terribly unpleasant .
such a lovely fire !
I like fire .
it likes me too . the flames are so attentive .
they lap at my fingers like a hound .
a pleasant sensation !
forgive me for not introducing myself , although , coming from afar , my name and title mean little to you .
forgotten in my homeland , unknown abroad , such is the traveler &apos;s fate !
but I &apos;m delighted to find myself in such gallant company !
- I hope you &apos;ll join us for dinner ?
- With pleasure !
did I interrupt your game ?
no matter . I &apos;d lost from the start .
you think so ?
Checkmate . you win .
Chess is so simple !
I didn &apos;t know your daughter will soon be wed !
forgive me for intruding on this family occasion !
I hope your fiancé isn &apos;t vexed by my ill-timed visit .
Dominique is not my fiancé .
no ?
you &apos;d make a lovely couple .
don &apos;t you agree ?
you look astonishingly like one of my daughters .
I &apos;m flattered .
- You have daughters ?
- Yes !
I have many children , boys and girls , but I must admit , I prefer girls , especially ones like you .
I prefer girls . boys are ungrateful .
no sense of duty , disobedient .
I &apos;m not a hard man , but I detest ...
I detest being disobeyed !
we all have our foibles , don &apos;t we ?
tell me , Baron , where is your daughter ?
shall we see her tonight ? I doubt it . she &apos;s already retired .
I think it &apos;s a caprice .
already ?
it &apos;s tragic to leave her all alone in her room with her &quot; caprice . &quot;
what a shame ! I &apos;d have loved to meet her .
since you resemble my daughter , would you intervene in favor of someone fetching the sweet bride-to-be ?
please , Baron ? it &apos;d make me so happy .
what wouldn &apos;t I do to make you happy ?
come , Renaud . you &apos;ll talk to her .
why do you laugh ?
why ?
how curious !
you laugh , yet don &apos;t know why !
perhaps you laughed simply because it &apos;s good to laugh once in a while .
surely you laughed because you sensed something will happen that &apos;s absolutely tragic !
Alas , even the best of us rejoice in the troubles of others !
it &apos;s only human .
but you wouldn &apos;t have dared to laugh if I hadn &apos;t laughed first .
don &apos;t be surprised by my clairvoyance !
I only use my talents for the good of all .
there &apos;s no need to peek through keyholes to know what happens in ladies &apos; chambers and men &apos;s hearts !
a lady is to wed a young man , but she loves another .
a banal story !
he joins her in her room , but he gets caught !
how sad .
if they are caught together , what happens ?
her lover is beaten , arrested by the guards !
they drag him to the stairs .
he stumbles , then gets up , only to fall under more blows !
this man has odiously abused my hospitality . he will be punished .
- You summoned me ?
- This man is a dog !
treat him as such ! so be it .
chain him up with the other dogs !
not a bad start !
how can I ever forgive you for this ?
and you , sire , do you hold the sister responsible for her brother &apos;s crimes ?
my heart is in shreds .
your suffering pains me .
forgive me , we &apos;ve just met , but it &apos;s sad to see you in such a state .
let &apos;s stroll in the garden .
the fresh air will do you good .
I don &apos;t know why , but that man scares me .
I &apos;m glad you don &apos;t blame this young woman for her brother &apos;s unfortunate conduct .
it &apos;s the mark of a generous soul and a chivalrous heart .
she &apos;s so fortunate to have found here all the affection she deserves .
- We care for her a lot . - Quite right !
she merits every respect .
and why not love ?
what a pretty ring !
may I ?
I adore jewelry .
marvelous craftsmanship .
judge for yourself .
this initial , this D !
it &apos;s so finely engraved , this D !
don &apos;t you agree ?
who are you ?
how did you get in ?
I &apos;m the Devil !
I could care less .
what ?
don &apos;t you understand ?
I &apos;m the Devil !
Yes , the Devil .
how else can I be here and elsewhere at once ?
Yes , elsewhere .
for example , in the garden .
if Dominique loves me , what can you do about it ?
absolutely nothing !
please , there &apos;s no need for violence !
what &apos;s so marvelous about that ?
I &apos;m here , locked in my room , but am I not also at the fountain where my beloved held me in his arms ?
you speak like a child , for you don &apos;t know my power .
just watch .
- You &apos;re jealous , that &apos;s all !
- Me ?
it &apos;s written all over your face .
&quot; Dominique , what wouldn &apos;t I do to make you happy ? &quot;
you cling to her skirts , cater to her whims .
you smile like a kind father , but your eyes betray your desire !
wretch !
what &apos;s wretched and laughable is an old man begging for love !
you shouldn &apos;t have done that .
gentlemen !
surely you won &apos;t kill each other in the garden , under your daughter &apos;s window ?
you &apos;re right .
- Tomorrow we shall duel as knights .
- To the death !
excellent idea !
if something terrible should happen , everyone will consider it an unfortunate accident .
- It &apos;s awful !
- Not at all !
nothing will befall your father . I &apos;ll watch over him .
leave me alone .
I &apos;m not listening . for me , you don &apos;t exist .
maybe not for you , but for others ...
Gilles , for example .
poor , miserable Gilles .
be quiet .
Gilles is no longer miserable .
he &apos;ll never be miserable because we love each other .
rejoice , Gilles ! it seems you &apos;re miserable no more !
here you are , chained up like a dog , waiting for the executioner to rip out your nails , gorge you with water , sew your eyelids shut , break a few bones !
naturally , none of this will trouble your happiness , the glorious happiness of love .
it &apos;s true . I &apos;m happy .
poor fool ! you won &apos;t get away with it .
that &apos;d be too easy !
if you possess someone even once , they belong to me forever !
do what you will with me , but Anne belongs to no one .
she is free .
you have no power over her .
you think she &apos;s all yours ?
for always ?
poor Gilles , look what you &apos;re reduced to !
a brilliant boy like you , caught in the pitiful traps of love .
you should know better . want an example ?
this place is full of them . listen , instead .
can &apos;t you hear the Baron tiptoeing through the castle ?
excuse me , I was simply passing by .
returning to my room after a moonlight stroll .
lovely night , isn &apos;t it ?
I couldn &apos;t sleep .
so I got up and went for a walk .
I understand completely .
I sleep like a baby , so I pity those who don &apos;t .
excuse me , Baron , but I &apos;m exhausted .
good night .
I &apos;m grateful you didn &apos;t hide this from me , but now I &apos;m frantic with worry .
I &apos;m afraid to lose you .
death in a duel is simple and swift , with barely time to suffer and none to think .
I admire how you speak of death so lightly !
I &apos;m not talking of my own death .
since I met you ,
I &apos;m filled with a ferocious lust for life .
a life with you .
with me , close to me .
in your arms , forever .
when the Baron struck me , I lost all respect for him .
tomorrow , after the duel , we &apos;ll run away together .
truly ?
you &apos;d abandon everything for me ?
once the Baron is dead , do you think I &apos;d stay here with Anne and your brother &apos;s lovesick wailing under our window each night ?
please , don &apos;t talk about poor Gilles !
I &apos;m already so afraid ... for your life .
have no fear .
look how fine the links are in this Italian chain mail !
here we can &apos;t make them this pretty or this strong .
with this and a bit of luck , even the worst blows can &apos;t harm me .
a fine proof of love , if you &apos;re in no danger !
don &apos;t you see ?
it &apos;s only to reassure you . I &apos;d fight bare-chested if you wished it .
I fear no man , nor the Devil , nor death !
&quot; nor the Devil , nor death . &quot;
you please me well , Renaud .
so confident , so dangerous !
tomorrow , wear this under your doublet .
you &apos;ll remember the warmth of my body as you fight to keep me .
Anne , my love , my true love !
Anne , you are as beautiful as the day !
I love you madly !
give me your lips !
leave me alone .
you aren &apos;t Gilles .
- What ? you aren &apos;t Gilles .
you look like Gilles , you have his voice , but Gilles would never say such things .
if you say so . then who am I ?
it &apos;s easy to guess .
you &apos;re the one who came yesterday .
you called yourself the Devil , the Demon , the Deceiver .
since you can &apos;t be fooled ...
it &apos;s true , you are the Deceiver .
you may even deceive yourself .
there are some things that escape you .
escape me ?
poor idiot ! nothing escapes me .
no one can escape me , not even you !
you don &apos;t know my powers !
I hold the world in my hands !
that &apos;s right ! storms , rain , hail , wind , shipwrecks : that &apos;s me !
sickness , war and all its pleasures , pestilence , famine , misery , murder , hatred , jealousy .
that &apos;s me , always me !
and death .
me , again !
with such an existence , I can see why you &apos;re not happy !
me , not happy ?
I &apos;m so easily amused !
I find the troubles of this world most entertaining .
they warm my heart , make me laugh .
Yes , they make me laugh . but I hate laughing by myself .
do you hear me ?
why don &apos;t you answer ?
what are you thinking of , wretch ?
a song my governess once sang , she said it was the fairies –
I detest fairies !
I detest stories like that !
when the two lovers &apos; hearts
beat as one
enough !
if you ever sing that again , I &apos;ll turn you to stone !
even if you turned me into a hag , or a dead serpent , it wouldn &apos;t matter to me because my love would still live .
&quot; her love . &quot;
she dares mention her love !
don &apos;t forget , treacherous creature , that you &apos;ve done wrong .
if it &apos;s a sin to give myself to the one I love ,
I don &apos;t regret it .
truly ?
you should be ashamed ! ashamed ?
why ?
I don &apos;t even know what shame is !
shame ... is what we hide .
if you &apos;re not ashamed of your love , why not shout it from the rooftops ?
why not tell the whole town ?
why not ?
listen !
I &apos;ve been locked in this room to keep me from the one I love .
I &apos;ve no wish to wound anyone , but I love Gilles .
not only do I love him ,
I have but one desire :
to be near him , to share his fate , for better or for worse .
&quot; for worse . &quot;
you can count on that , dear girl .
the sin of scandal is the greatest sin .
your poor daughter must be possessed by a demon !
poor Anne .
it breaks my heart to treat her like this , but as the shame was public , so must be the punishment .
sad lost children
we wander through the night
where are day &apos;s blooms ?
love &apos;s pleasures ?
life &apos;s radiance ?
sad lost children
we wander through the night
the Devil treacherously whisks us away
the Devil whisks us away
our youth is dust
and our loves too
how beautiful to hear it sung with such sadness !
it melts my heart .
it &apos;s true , and I enjoy it .
sing some more , for me .
you don &apos;t want to ?
you don &apos;t want to hurt me , to make me cry , to make me as tender as a little lamb ?
too bad !
you &apos;re determined not to please me .
so be it !
but take heed , I &apos;ll be back .
Renaud ordered me to modify your face and body so terribly
that no woman will ever love you !
forget such things .
close your eyes , like I close mine .
forget your chains .
take me to our fountain .
it &apos;s so like you to forget your chains , to take refuge in happy memories !
Alas , I am here !
I have no ill intentions .
memories are lovely , but the past is gone forever !
the present is what counts and right now , some surprising things are happening !
look how clear the water is , like a cloudless sky .
what silence !
a deathly silence .
a grand tournament . lovely ladies , fine weather , noble lords .
there &apos;s your humble servant , seated on Dominique &apos;s right .
what a show !
everyone is enjoying it .
Gilles , they &apos;ll fight to the death , I know it .
it &apos;s true , one of them must die .
as a favor , I &apos;ll let you decide .
give me a name .
don &apos;t answer . there &apos;s no point . he &apos;s already decided .
you see ?
a little blood can ruin the clearest water !
you should get some rest .
you &apos;re exhausted .
Renaud ...
I already considered him as a son .
this is the hand that struck him ...
these things happen .
it was just bad luck . he died at my hand .
bells , always bells !
what an odd custom !
Yes , a man is dead , but why make so much noise ?
those bells are exasperating !
and Baron Hugues !
poor Baron , isn &apos;t he exasperating with his empty words , his suffering , his remorse , his heavy sighs ?
Dominique , you should take him away .
where ?
I don &apos;t know . anywhere .
to the Devil , as they say ! out of my sight , out of everyone &apos;s sight !
it &apos;d be pleasant to stay here for a while .
and Anne ...
what do you think of her ?
she &apos;s a charming creature , isn &apos;t she ?
I &apos;ve never seen anyone like her .
do you think she really loves Gilles ?
if she loves him , she &apos;s capable of loving someone else .
who ?
are you jealous , my dear ?
I was a child when you met me .
you know I &apos;m incapable of suffering .
I feel no pain , no joy , no pleasure .
is it really necessary for me to take this old man away ?
Yes , his time has come .
he &apos;s lived long enough . he &apos;s had his fill .
it &apos;s a shame .
I &apos;d have preferred to take the other one .
at least he was young .
you shouldn &apos;t take these affairs so seriously .
they &apos;re as old as the world , and just as worn out .
Yes , it &apos;d be very pleasant indeed .
Anne ... may your chains fall .
appear in the garden , on this bench .
what &apos;s going on ?
never happened before ...
finally !
you kept me waiting , dear .
you know I &apos;m not here of my own will .
I &apos;m so terribly sorry , but do me the pleasure of sitting with me .
please don &apos;t cry !
it hurts to see such a pretty face twisted in sorrow .
leave me alone .
my heart is sad , so sad .
I &apos;m not used to unhappiness and now Gilles is in prison , threatened by the executioner ,
Renaud is dead , and my father is in despair .
could you be the cause of all these troubles ?
what do you expect ?
no one loves me .
I amuse myself as best I can .
if you only knew how sensitive I am , how the slightest thing wounds me !
whenever there &apos;s a new joy in the world , or a new love shines , you can &apos;t imagine my suffering !
I &apos;d cry ... if only I had tears .
I assure you , if someone loved me , it &apos;d help so much .
life would be so easy and pleasant if only you tried to understand me .
truly , the love Gilles offers is derisory !
whereas I ...
but that &apos;s quite impossible , for I love Gilles .
Gilles ! what use is he ?
do you think he hears you ?
Yes , he hears me because I love him .
Anne , have no fear . I love you !
don &apos;t listen to him !
he has no power over you !
Anne , my love !
my life !
Alas , I fear my poor brother has lost his wits .
it &apos;s possible .
sometimes I think I &apos;m losing mine .
my guilty love for you made me kill Renaud .
why are you dressed like that ?
I &apos;m leaving .
I feel guilty , too .
and yet , my wrongdoing was involuntary .
who can blame you for being beautiful and desirable ?
you don &apos;t know the whole truth .
Renaud fought without chain mail to please me .
that &apos;s why your blow killed him .
how horrible !
why did you do it ?
you have to ask ?
I believed Renaud quicker and stronger than you .
I feared the worst , I feared losing you .
Dominique . Yes , my lord ,
I did it out of love for you .
you say you love me , yet you are leaving ?
I must go .
my life is yours now .
you know I can &apos;t allow you to go alone .
wherever you go , I &apos;ll go .
Alas , my lord , how could I ask you to abandon everything for me ?
don &apos;t forget your promise , my lord . &quot; wherever you go , I &apos;ll go . &quot;
you &apos;ll be mine because you love Gilles and it &apos;s the only way to save him .
if I wish , I can make him the most miserable creature in the world !
impossible ! surely , you couldn &apos;t ?
Yes !
I can transform him into any horrible thing I choose !
no , I beg you !
I can also make him forget you and send him on his way , carefree , without memories or regrets .
alive , like everyone else .
he can &apos;t forget me .
everyone forgets ! he &apos;ll forget immediately .
you &apos;ll forget later . but I don &apos;t want to ! if he forgets me , I &apos;ll never love another .
you prefer the company of a monster who remembers you ?
at heart , I &apos;m not a bad devil .
I can make you happy , believe me .
your every wish will be my command .
I have only one wish :
to return to Gilles in the prison where he calls me .
- Be quiet ! - I want to be with Gilles .
Anne ... Can &apos;t you hear him calling ?
she makes a fool of me !
and yet , I love her !
I was too sweet , too obliging .
that &apos;s no way to win a woman ! all that will change !
why so sad , Anne ?
look at me , think of me
as if it were the last time .
what do you mean ?
nothing .
I don &apos;t know .
I love you so much that I fear one day you &apos;ll forget me .
forget you ?
but , Anne , I &apos;d rather forget to breathe , forget to live ...
I hope I &apos;m not disturbing you !
excuse me .
I &apos;m waiting for your answer . I don &apos;t know the question , but don &apos;t answer .
it &apos;s a trap .
nothing keeps you here , dear child , now that your father is gone .
- My father ?
- Don &apos;t worry about him !
he left with Dominique .
all &apos;s well that ends well .
there is a slight age difference .
but what does it matter ? they love one another .
enough about them . let &apos;s talk about us .
and him .
since he still interests you ...
be quiet !
leave her alone !
I know my fate is in your hands , but what do I care ?
I love her and you have no power over her .
how do you know ?
Anne , let &apos;s talk seriously .
Gilles wrote this himself and signed it in his own hand with his blood .
it was wrong , but he did it .
it &apos;s too late now .
give me your answer .
if I say yes to you , he &apos;ll be free forever ?
as free as a bird , like a fish in the water .
don &apos;t listen to him !
please , Anne .
will you accept to follow me , to try to love me ?
Yes .
finally !
what gorgeous sunshine !
and what a lovely castle !
what ? I &apos;m imprisoned ?
no , you &apos;re not .
you &apos;re free , totally free !
that &apos;s much better !
can you tell me where we are , who this castle belongs to ?
is it yours ?
it doesn &apos;t matter ! I &apos;ve no wish to know you .
I don &apos;t like how you smile at me .
anyway , none of this matters .
I feel like laughing , for I &apos;m alive !
the sun is shining , what more could I want ?
you &apos;re so beautiful !
one only sees such creatures in dreams .
you &apos;re the prettiest girl in the world .
why are you so sad ?
- This is no place for you .
- Is she your daughter ?
no , she &apos;s not my daughter .
I understand , and I understand her sorrow .
life can be unfair .
youth should be spent with other youths .
perhaps she loves you .
anyway , it doesn &apos;t concern me .
excuse me .
I kept my promise .
you &apos;re mine now . forever !
no .
what do you mean , &quot; No &quot; ?
I can &apos;t believe it !
you promised .
you swore .
I lied .
that &apos;s impossible .
you don &apos;t know how .
you couldn &apos;t lie !
all the same , I lied . that &apos;s the truth .
it &apos;s impossible !
Anne , pure as snow , clearer than spring water ,
Anne , the only person in the world I trusted !
why did you do such a thing ?
how dare you !
all &apos;s fair in love .
to save Gilles , I &apos;d have done much worse .
I &apos;ve lost him .
I &apos;ll never love again .
and yet , without recognizing me , he found me beautiful and told me so .
be quiet !
if you keep talking like that , there &apos;s no telling what I &apos;ll do !
do whatever you wish , but please , let me return once more to the fountain where I was happy .
so be it .
is that you ?
what luck has led me here ?
are you alone ?
Yes .
the old man with you is gone ?
Yes .
now I &apos;m even happier .
are you thirsty ?
the water is so sweet !
your lips are sweet , too .
my love .
I knew I couldn &apos;t lose you .
get away from him !
no .
nothing can separate us now .
for the last time , get away from him !
to stone , do you hear me ?
I &apos;ll turn you to stone !
the silence I adore ...
deathly silence .
what &apos;s that ?
what &apos;s that noise ?
it &apos;s their hearts !
their hearts beating !
still beating !
beating !
Roberto !
you promised .
Adios , Kashkin .
- Adios , Roberto .
BUNKER
Hola , Americano .
Hola . Hola .
help yourself , Jordan .
- General Golz ?
what an accent !
he even knows me in the dark !
that &apos;s all we have in Spain now ... accents .
eh , Jordan ?
- I was looking for you .
I saw you . how did it go with the train ?
alright .
and Kashkin ?
- He caught one .
he didn &apos;t want to be taken alive .
Oh , so it was like that ?
- Yes . murder .
orders are orders .
- I still call it murder .
- Well ... in this business , Jordan , remember nothing .
what &apos;s next ? - A bridge .
- Oh , a bridge .
- Right .
to blow the bridge is nothing .
but to blow it at the time of the attack , that &apos;s a horse of another color , as you Americans say .
- Attack ?
Yes . at last we take the offensive . Oh , it will be a beautiful attack .
on paper it looks wonderful , and if it succeeds ...
no , I will not say &quot; if . &quot; this time it must succeed and it will .
what I &apos;ve told you , Jordan , is known only to the general staff .
our only chance to succeed is by a surprise attack .
now , here is the bridge , over a deep gorge .
it &apos;s the only way the enemy can bring up reinforcements .
tanks , artillery , troops , all must come over this bridge .
I must know it is gone . not before the attack , they &apos;d rebuild it .
it must go the minute the attack starts , no sooner , no later .
so the bridge is nothing . but suppose their soldiers are sitting on it .
you know , sentries on both ends . what do you do then ?
in my country , they say , &quot; Never blow a bridge till you come to it . &quot;
- Good .
that &apos;s good , you joke .
in this business , one should joke a little .
I am so serious . it &apos;s why I can joke .
you think you can get through enemy lines tomorrow night ?
- Sure .
good . that will give you 3 days to prepare for the dynamiting .
wait for the attack at dawn , after the third night .
how will I know the exact time ?
- Well , use these .
listen . first we attack from the air .
when you hear the explosions , that &apos;s your time .
I &apos;ve got a good guide for you , an old man named Anselmo .
knows the country like a fox , and the people to help you .
now , go and find yourself a pretty girl .
but first get a haircut .
- Is that an order , General ?
why not ?
- I don &apos;t like your barber .
up the gorge to the left is the bridge .
sentry boxes , huh ?
- At each end , Roberto .
always two sentries on guard .
where do the sentries live ?
- At the road-mender &apos;s hut , across the bridge .
you can &apos;t see it from here .
the other post is on this side , in that old sawmill .
how many men in the sawmill ?
- Eight , and a corporal .
the other post , how many men ?
- Maybe more .
we &apos;ll find out .
look !
they always spit in the gorge .
it brings luck .
I wish I could spit that far .
Roberto !
that sentry , he looks like a man from my village .
he &apos;s very young .
he must die ?
- You couldn &apos;t do it , Anselmo ?
I would kill the sentry , considering the necessity of the bridge .
but if I live later , I &apos;ll try to live in such a way , doing no harm to anyone , that it will be forgiven .
come on , let &apos;s get this dynamite somewhere safe .
you wait here , Roberto .
- Oh , I can make it , Anselmo .
you want to be shot at , carrying these ?
no , not even in a joke .
go ahead .
Roberto !
he &apos;s the boss here , Roberto . very strong man .
- I can see .
foreigner ?
- And a friend . didn &apos;t the old man tell you ?
I &apos;m asking you .
I &apos;m here for the Republic .
you know those seals , don &apos;t you ?
SIM , Service of Military Intelligence .
the General Staff commands for the Republic .
in these mountains , I command . no one else .
what &apos;s that ?
- Dynamite .
good . I can use dynamite .
how much you bring me ?
none . what &apos;s your name ?
what &apos;s that to you ?
- Pablo . he &apos;s Pablo .
what for ?
- A bridge .
what bridge ?
- That &apos;s my business .
in this country , it &apos;s my business .
- Don &apos;t talk so !
- You want to die ?
no !
- Shut your mouth .
- This comrade comes for the Republic !
Anselmo !
help us get this stuff up to your camp . the old man &apos;s tired .
Hola !
what is this that comes ?
the old man and a dynamiter .
Hey , that stuff ! not in the cave .
what &apos;re you making ?
- A trap for foxes .
see ? very practical .
- He catches rabbits .
if a Gypsy catches rabbits , he says it &apos;s foxes .
if he catches a fox , it &apos;s an elephant .
- And if I catch an elephant ?
you &apos;d say it was a tank .
I &apos;ll get me a tank , old man !
some day I &apos;ll get me one and you can call it what you please .
Gypsies talk much , kill little .
I &apos;m going for wine .
- Bring a cup for me .
you have wine , huh ?
- And plenty of it .
we eat like generals here .
- Yeah , he eats like ten generals .
and what do Gypsies do in the war ?
- They keep on being Gypsies .
that &apos;s a good job .
- The best .
how do they call you ?
- Roberto .
and you ?
Rafael . Oh , wine !
- There will be food soon .
food !
Oh , you have tobacco !
Yeah , I know these .
much air and little tobacco .
Ah , we eat !
Hola !
Hola !
that &apos;s how I comb it .
go ahead and eat .
Hey , bread !
how are you called ?
María . and you ?
Roberto .
been here long ?
this long .
three months . they shaved my head in Valladolid .
I was on the train heading south .
- The train Pablo blew at Arévalo .
many of the prisoners were caught again , but they saved me .
they and Pilar .
- We found her hiding in the rocks where she &apos;d run off .
you should have seen her !
no hair at all . cried all the time .
and if anyone touched her , she &apos;d shiver like a wet dog .
man , but she was ugly .
- God &apos;s truth , Roberto .
though Gypsies usually lie . she looked like a half-drowned kitten .
you blow trains ?
- I have .
here ?
- No , in Extremadura .
in another six months it &apos;ll grow out .
are you his woman ?
- Pablo &apos;s ?
you &apos;ve seen Pablo !
I &apos;ve seen Rafael too .
- No . no , not the Gypsy .
this is a very strange woman . is of no one .
but she cooks well .
really of no one ?
no one .
nor of you , either .
no .
no . I have no time for women .
no ?
María !
who &apos;s that ?
Pablo &apos;s woman , Pilar .
she &apos;s something barbarous !
but brave !
a hundred times braver than Pablo .
- Pablo was brave in the beginning .
he killed more people than cholera .
Yes , at the start he kill more people than the bubonic plague .
but , Pilar , she is something barbarous !
the Gypsy &apos;s afraid of her .
- Why not ?
she hates me .
why ?
- She treats me as a time waster .
she doesn &apos;t like Gypsies .
- What an injustice !
she has Gypsy blood herself . she knows of what she speaks .
but she has a tongue . it bites like a bull whip .
what are you saying now , you lazy son of an unmentionable Gypsy ?
answer me , Gypsy !
I was telling this comrade what a kind woman you are , Pilar .
liar !
- This one comes as a dynamiter .
- I know that .
go and relieve Andrés . he &apos;s on guard at the top .
I go , Pilar . I &apos;ll see you , Roberto , when we eat .
- Not even in a joke !
3 times today you &apos;ve eaten .
but I can eat twice more .
- Get out of here !
and send me Andrés !
Hola , Inglés .
how are you and the Republic ?
- Good .
both good .
- I &apos;m happy .
what did that Gypsy say about me ?
- He said you were much woman .
and I &apos;d say he &apos;s right .
and what did you say to the girl , before I came out ?
- Nothing .
I saw how she was from seeing you .
- I only joked with her .
- Jokes ?
listen to me , Inglés . she &apos;s young , not hardened as we are .
and she &apos;s had a bad time . you understand ?
Yes , I guess so . - I &apos;m worried about her .
when do you leave here ?
- In three days . if I &apos;m still alive .
what made you say that ?
that never brings luck .
let me see your hand .
well ?
- Nothing .
I saw nothing . what do you come for ?
blow another train ?
no , a bridge .
- All the better .
now we have horses . let &apos;s blow all the bridges and go !
I &apos;m sick of this place . we are rotting here because there &apos;s no fighting .
only watching Pablo get drunk . this life is ruining him .
what did you see in my hand ?
- I saw nothing .
Yes , you did .
I &apos;m only curious . I don &apos;t believe in it .
- In what do you believe ?
in my work .
- I saw that .
- What else ?
nothing else .
the bridge is very difficult ?
- No . it is important .
but it can be very difficult ?
- Yes .
I &apos;m going to look it over again . how many men have you got here ?
five . the Gypsy is worthless , although his intentions are good .
Pablo , I no longer trust .
thanks . I like your way of speaking .
- I try to speak frankly .
then tell me what you saw in my hand .
- No .
I saw nothing else .
go now to the bridge . I look after your equipment .
let me tell you again , Inglés . I &apos;m glad you &apos;ve come .
we will understand each other .
can they not dwell outside ?
I don &apos;t want dynamite in here . we have fire .
it &apos;s far from the fire .
smoke ?
how goes the Gypsy ?
is she going to let you eat again ?
- Why not ?
is there wine ?
- Not much left .
then I &apos;ll have some water .
María , is there any water left ?
it &apos;s too strong , or I &apos;d give you some .
I &apos;d offer it to you , Pablo , but there &apos;s not much left .
I have wine .
- What drink is it ?
medicine , you wanna taste it ?
what &apos;s it for ?
it changes your ideas .
- Yeah ?
bitter as gall !
I &apos;d rather be sick than have the medicine .
that &apos;s the wormwood . I &apos;m glad you don &apos;t like it .
what are you saying there ?
I was explaining the medicine .
what &apos;s that ?
- The bridge showing the construction .
look how it seems .
why , it &apos;s the bridge itself !
how do you blow a bridge ?
- That &apos;s what I &apos;m figuring out .
no !
I don &apos;t go for the bridge . neither me nor my people .
then we &apos;ll do it alone . old one ?
- Yes .
without this coward .
- Hey , you ! what did you say ?
nothing for you .
I spoke to Roberto .
my orders are to blow the bridge .
- And I say no !
in these mountains we hide .
I take care of my people . live one place , fight somewhere else .
fight , raid , blow trains , bridges , but way off .
not here where they will hunt us .
- You &apos;ll clear out . you &apos;ve got horses .
I have 5 horses and 8 people .
you and the old man with the loud mouth make ten .
now if this bridge is blown , we will be hunted .
hunted from the earth , from the air .
the explosions will fall from the sky on my horses .
until you had horses , you were one of us .
now you &apos;re rich with horses , you want to retire .
a lie ! you know I expose the horses for the cause .
to eat well , yes . to steal , yes .
to murder , yes . to fight for the Republic , no !
you are an old man who will make trouble with his mouth .
I am an old man not afraid to fight . I &apos;m an old man without horses .
you might not live long .
I &apos;m an old man who will live until I die .
you will blow no bridge here !
no ?
- No .
no bridge .
Pilar !
what do you say ?
- I am for the bridge .
and for the Republic .
- What &apos;s that , woman ?
I am for the bridge and against you . nothing more .
what do you say , Primitivo ?
- I am also for the bridge .
Fernando ?
to me the bridge means nothing . I &apos;m for the woman of Pablo .
Andrés !
- Yes , equally !
the same , Pilar .
then we blow the bridge and retreat to the Gredos afterwards .
you with your head of a bull and heart of a hawk !
you think there &apos;ll be any &quot; afterwards &quot; , from this bridge ?
I am for the Republic and the Republic is the bridge !
it means nothing to be hunted like a beast after this thing which brings no profit ?
nor even to die for it ?
don &apos;t try to frighten us , coward !
coward ?
is it cowardly to know what &apos;s foolish ?
or am I a leader for nothing ?
haven &apos;t I gotten you this far alive ?
this foreigner comes to do a thing for the good of the foreigners .
for his goal you want to sacrifice us !
I &apos;m for the good and safety of all .
- Safety !
there is no such thing .
did I spend 9 years with matadors not to learn about fear and safety ?
speak to me of anything but safety !
look at him . how I believed in him once .
and look what he is now . from a year of war you &apos;ve become lazy , a drunkard and a coward .
- Woman !
you have no right to speak like that . not before my people and a stranger .
do you still believe you command here ?
Yes .
here I command !
- Here I command !
haven &apos;t you heard them ? here no one commands but me now .
I should shoot you and the foreigner both .
try it and see what happens .
listen to me , drunkard ! you understand now who commands ?
why , I command !
- No !
listen !
take the wax from your ears .
listen well .
I command .
alright .
you command .
and if you want , he can command too .
maybe I am lazy and drink too much .
maybe you think I &apos;m a coward , though you know better .
maybe .
but I &apos;m not stupid .
now if you &apos;re a woman as well as a commander , show us something to eat .
María !
take the food .
you must be careful .
- Pablo ? - If you sleep , yes .
I &apos;ll watch out .
what &apos;s he doing ?
only drinking . there will be danger if he begins to hide the sadness .
if he pretends to be friendly , then he &apos;s made a decision .
I heard Pilar say it .
- What kind of decision ?
who knows ?
after what &apos;s happened , it &apos;d mean danger for you .
I &apos;ll look after myself . I &apos;m thinking about the bridge .
I &apos;m thinking about you , Roberto .
why , María ?
well , I don &apos;t know .
did I muss it ?
all day I wanted you to do that .
I too , María .
where &apos;s Pablo ?
Ah , he &apos;s gone to the horses . now you have to kill him .
kill him before he kills you .
- He won &apos;t kill me .
we waited for you to kill him . why didn &apos;t you ?
and turn Pilar against me ?
she &apos;s in control here .
so , he takes the horses and goes . what about your bridge then ?
you don &apos;t know Pablo .
now men , you have tightened your garters .
you , my friend , you know I &apos;m not a coward .
you are no woman , no fool .
nor any colt of a girl either that makes a man crazy with hunger .
you don &apos;t lie , make insults , and leave me , like my people .
Yes , eat , my friend .
pay no attention to the woman . you know who commands .
you and me , we &apos;ll show them who &apos;s stupid .
get out of sight !
ours ?
- German and Italian .
can they see the horses ?
- They &apos;re not looking for horses .
man ! I could see their faces !
- I spit in their faces !
I spit in the milk of their mothers !
I tell you they could see the horses .
- Wipe the sweat from your face .
they could see the cigarette butts .
- Huh ?
Hey , wait ! they may be back !
- Coward !
go to your horses !
have you seen planes like this before ?
- Never , Inglés .
- Get inside .
I &apos;m going with Pilar to El Sordo .
we &apos;ve got to have more horses .
you know your sentry posts . keep a close watch .
Anselmo , write down everything that passes along the road .
I can &apos;t write , Roberto .
- I &apos;ll show you how to write .
look how Roberto can make pictures .
that &apos;s a truck , see ?
and here &apos;s a soldier on a horse .
look ! tank !
I will catch me a tank like that , old man .
whatever passes , make a mark . the man on the horse is for cavalry .
each mark means a troop of twenty mounted men . understand ?
each troop a mark .
- In this way I can write , yes .
that &apos;s an educated pencil .
use one paper for each direction .
tonight I &apos;ll know then what they &apos;re moving up to the front .
better get along , and take some food with you .
can I write too ?
watch the bridge and sentry posts .
see if more soldiers are brought , and at what intervals the guard is changed .
what is &quot; intervals &quot; ?
how many hours the sentries stay on and when they go .
without a watch ?
- Take mine .
what a watch ! look at what a complication .
it should be able to read and write .
- Don &apos;t fool with it .
can you tell time ?
- Why not ?
12 o &apos;clock day ... hunger .
6 o &apos;clock night ... drunk . with luck .
ten o &apos;clock now .
- You don &apos;t need to be a clown .
do what I tell you and keep out of sight .
Salud , Gypsy . did you see the air machines ?
- See them ?
we ate them for breakfast !
is there food , Pilar ?
I &apos;m hungry .
it &apos;s a long walk from La Granja .
la Granja ?
- Yes , Roberto . you wish tobacco ?
you ?
- Didn &apos;t you sleep here last night ?
for a while , yes .
then I thought of my woman and children in La Granja .
then I went there .
- Wasn &apos;t that dangerous ?
you have to get past their sentries . that &apos;s why I only go at night .
Oh , María !
see much movement on the road ?
- Nothing .
a few trucks as usual . cars . a few guns , as usual .
no troops . - Pick up any news in town ?
but nothing .
still goes battle in the north . that &apos;s not news .
Oh , yes ... there is talk of the Republic preparing an attack .
what ?
- That we are preparing an offensive .
where ?
perhaps here or near Navacerrada .
have you heard of it ?
- Who told you that ?
who ?
surely you know how rumors fly ?
the officers talks in the cafes and the waiters listen .
they say this is an offensive of some size , but ... it &apos;s only a rumor .
what else did you hear ?
nothing , man .
there is some talk of the Republicans wanting to blow the bridges , but ...
are you joking ?
- This one doesn &apos;t joke , Inglés .
bad luck he doesn &apos;t .
a man like me is never alarmed by rumors , Pilar .
remember anything more ?
- No .
they talk as usual of soldiers to be sent to clear us out of the mountains .
there is some talk troops are on the way . but it &apos;s always like that .
it &apos;s not important . only rumors as usual .
rumors !
everything as usual !
things are bad in the north , as usual !
that troops come to hunt us out , as usual !
an offensive here , as usual !
man , you are a monument to &quot; as usual &quot; .
but the last two , Pilar , are only rumors .
my mother !
- Let &apos;s go , Pilar .
who &apos;ll look after my things ?
- The man of rumors .
Fernando , guard the explosives .
- Very well , Pilar .
calm yourself . there is nothing to worry about . only rumors .
wait !
Hello , María .
Hello , Roberto .
Inglés !
Hola , Pilar !
- Hola !
Joaquín ! - María !
- Tell Sordo I &apos;m coming with Inglés !
a good boy , Inglés .
El Sordo saved him when his family was killed , and now they are like father and son .
Inglés , tell me , have you known many women ?
they meant nothing .
- I think you lie .
well , maybe ... a little .
- And for this one , for María , you care much ?
- Let &apos;s get on .
what is the reason for the bridge , Inglés ? will there be an attack ?
and the airplanes this morning ?
does that mean the enemy &apos;s found out ?
they &apos;re preparing a counterattack ?
I only know one thing for certain .
- What ? - You have to shout .
one thing is certain . the bridge must go when the attack starts .
and to do that we &apos;ve got to have more horses and more men .
when do we blow it ?
day after tomorrow !
why not tonight ?
orders .
how do you get whiskey ?
- Make it !
no , I joke .
this is good whiskey , we got it on a raid .
no ice . plenty ice up there .
too far .
easier blow the bridge tonight .
- I &apos;d be shot for it .
do it in daylight , we &apos;ll all be shot .
not if we have horses . - Hmm ?
- Not if we have enough horses .
we &apos;ll be out of here before they come .
I have five horses and four men .
five men , Sordo .
- So it is . five with the boy .
five men and five horses .
that &apos;s ten horses for 15 people . we &apos;ve got to have five more horses .
for the retreat , yes . otherwise we won &apos;t make it .
how can you get horses ?
- Steal &apos; em .
only soldiers have horses now . soldiers and thieves like us .
can you get five more tonight ?
- What ?
- Tonight !
we can try .
- Good .
maybe not so good . not good if it snows .
horses make tracks and soldiers follow tracks .
it is too late for snow , Sordo . - Hmm ?
- It &apos;s the month of May !
and the sun is shining .
look at the young general . already he &apos;s stealing horses .
he &apos;s always talking , Pilar , how he carried the girl from the train .
let &apos;s see you carry her down the hill , my boy .
now you make fun of me .
wait , Joaquín ! I &apos;ll carry you on my shoulders .
look , Inglés !
look at the bullfighter . he &apos;s crying .
don &apos;t mock , Pilar . he was telling me about his sister .
she was a prisoner as I was , and he just heard that she &apos;s dead .
I &apos;m your sister now , Joaquín .
we all love you . we are your family .
- Yes .
including the Inglés . is that right ?
- Of course .
you hear that , boy ?
the Inglés is your brother .
we &apos;re all brothers , Joaquín .
- Thank you , Inglés .
don &apos;t worry . I &apos;ll get you a horse tonight .
one for María too .
- What about me ?
do I have to kiss you too ?
it &apos;s been years since I kissed a bullfighter .
hold this , Inglés , till I get a good kiss at him .
look at him !
he &apos;s afraid of a kiss as he was afraid of the bulls !
no need to joke .
when I kiss , it won &apos;t be as a sister . this trick of kissing as a sister !
don &apos;t be so brutal , Pilar !
I love you very much , but why do you speak so brutally ?
why do you think , girl ?
rest , Pilar ! you are tired .
- Shut up !
nobody asked your advice !
you think I &apos;m an old woman .
sit down .
many things tire me .
and one of them is to be old and ugly .
and another is to see a boy panic when I joke that I might kiss him .
it &apos;s not true . you didn &apos;t see that .
- What d &apos; you know , with your face ?
I have an evil temper today , and I &apos;m jealous .
how foolish .
I &apos;m an ugly old woman , and I love you very much , child .
I love you too . you &apos;re not ugly .
go on , I &apos;m not ugly !
I was born ugly .
do you know how an ugly woman feels ?
do you know what it is to be ugly all your life and feel beautiful in here ?
- You are beautiful .
try to use your head and not your heart , and listen .
I &apos;m telling you things of much interest . does it interest you ?
María &apos;s right .
- Two of a kind !
you are a prize for any woman . if you &apos;d ever let go of yourself .
and this one ... this one is a gift to any man , if she could cook a little better .
give me a cigarette and listen .
life is very curious .
I would have made a good man , but I &apos;m all woman and all ugly .
yet many men have loved me . is that strange ?
I don &apos;t think you &apos;re ugly .
don &apos;t lie to me . or has it begun to work with you too ?
no , no , no . look , I am ugly .
yet one can have a feeling here that blinds a man while he loves you .
he thinks you are beautiful , and one day , for no reason at all , he sees you ugly , as you really are .
then you see yourself as ugly as he sees you .
and you lose your man and your feeling .
then one day the feeling , that idiotic feeling that you are beautiful , grows inside of you again .
and another man sees you and thinks you &apos;re beautiful .
and it &apos;s all to do over again .
now I am past it . but it still might come again .
lift your head , this silliness is over .
I was only jealous of your 19 years . it isn &apos;t a jealously that lasts .
you won &apos;t be 19 always .
you see , I have evil thoughts , Inglés .
if I were 19 , I &apos;d take you away from this cropped head , even with my ugly face .
no , no , sit there .
I have a surprise for you . close your eyes .
you too , Inglés . no , tightly , both of you .
Pilar , wait !
- Shut up , Inglés !
I &apos;m bored with both of you !
- Pilar !
let her go , Roberto .
don &apos;t you want to be alone with me ?
- Of course .
and I want to be with you , Roberto .
Pilar knows it . she knows everything .
- I &apos;m beginning to believe it .
will she be alright ? - You don &apos;t have to worry about her .
it &apos;s a wonderful day , Roberto .
what are you worrying about ?
- About you .
me ? why ?
because I &apos;m so happy ?
I wish you weren &apos;t here , María .
I mean it .
I &apos;m thinking about what will happen to you after the bridge .
can &apos;t I go with you ?
El Sordo will get us horses for sure . I know we need them for the escape .
you &apos;ve got to understand , María . I &apos;m in this war to the finish .
I can &apos;t have anything serious in my life .
a man doing what I &apos;m doing never knows what &apos;s going to happen .
whatever happens to you will happen to me .
haven &apos;t you anyone in the Republic ?
no relatives all ?
you must have people somewhere .
my father and my mother , I saw them killed .
my father was the mayor of our town and a Republican .
when the Nationalists came , they lined up the Republicans against the wall .
my father cried out very loud , &quot; Long live the Republic ! &quot;
and then they shot him .
but my mother was not a Republican . she had no politics .
but she loved my father and she couldn &apos;t say that .
so she just looked at my father who lay there at her feet , and said ,
&quot; long live my husband who was the mayor of this town . &quot;
she said it very loud , like a shriek , and then they shot and she fell , and I wanted to got to her , but we were all tied by the wrists in a long line of girls and women .
and I wanted to be shot too and say , &quot; Long live the Republic and my mother and my father . &quot;
instead , there was no more shooting .
they herded us up the hill and through the streets to the square .
my father &apos;s office was in the city hall , but they took us across the street to the barber shop .
I want to tell you .
- No . don &apos;t .
Roberto ... are you angry about something ?
of course not .
I &apos;m glad .
I won &apos;t cry any more .
Oh Roberto ...
I like ...
I don &apos;t know how to kiss or I would kiss you .
where do the noses go ?
always I &apos;ve wondered where the noses would go .
they &apos;re not in the way , are they ?
I always thought they would be .
look , I can do it myself .
- María .
did I do it wrong ?
look , Pilar !
Roberto fell in the brook .
already she makes you blind , Inglés ?
can &apos;t even see where you &apos;re going .
Hola , Inglés . come sit down here where it &apos;s warm .
I &apos;ll take your shoes and put them in the smoke of the fire to dry .
Hey , don &apos;t burn them . I don &apos;t want to stand around here barefooted .
María , fetch me some dry socks .
- The lord and master .
here &apos;s the key . the pack is locked .
who &apos;s on guard at the top ?
- Agustín .
put these on . dry your feet well .
you can &apos;t dry them with your hair ?
what a swine .
hit him with a chunk of wood , María .
I &apos;m joking because I &apos;m happy .
- You are happy ?
Yes . I think everything goes well .
keep this under your feet until your shoes are dry .
must you care for him as a child ?
- No . as a man who &apos;s cold and wet .
and a man who has just come home to his house .
take the coffee , worthless one .
does it always grow dark this early ?
- No , Inglés . it &apos;s the weather .
the wind is very disorderly .
- Getting colder out .
Yes , Inglés . it is not correct to be so cold in the month of May .
any movement on the road , Anselmo ?
- Not much .
it &apos;s all marked on the papers .
- Gypsy , what about the bridge ?
six hour interval .
I stayed till they changed the watch , at noon and at six .
it was a long watch , Inglés . and cold !
my ... my bones brea ...
how about the sawmill post ?
- Eight men and a corporal .
no more arrived .
- What about the road-mender &apos;s hut ?
I didn &apos;t get that far . I remembered what you said . to be careful .
only ten cars ?
- All written down , Roberto .
Inglés !
how do you like it , Pilar ?
very beautiful , the snow , huh ?
get out of my sight !
God help El Sordo .
if it snows all night , it may cover his tracks .
- Lf , if !
how do you like it , woman ?
how do you like to command when it snows ?
- Shut up , drunkard !
I know why you went to see El Sordo .
horses make tracks in the snow , hey , Inglés ? Yeah .
now there will be no offensive . no bridge . no .
Yeah .
and no making love in the heather !
watch your mouth !
no . let me .
María !
wipe the table clean , María !
wipe your own spillings !
wipe first your chin , drunkard , and then the table !
pay no attention to him . he &apos;s drunk .
fix my shoes , María .
are you really drunk ?
- Why not ?
but not too drunk to watch your mouth !
no one on guard at the top ?
- In this storm ?
what for ?
no soldiers will move in these mountains tonight .
Pilar , bring me something hot to eat !
wine , Inglés ?
I thought I was Roberto .
- I call you Inglés before the others .
Roberto ?
don Roberto !
how is Don Roberto ?
- Fine , Don Pablo .
how &apos;s Bacchus ?
who is Bacchus ?
you know . your constant companion .
I don &apos;t know such a man .
you say funny things , Inglés .
- Sure , I do . I &apos;m a laugh a minute .
pay no attention . he &apos;s drunk .
- Tell us , Inglés , why have you come so far to fight for our Republic ?
a man fights for what he believes in , Fernando .
- In his own country .
maybe you feel I &apos;m sticking my nose into other people &apos;s business , but I don &apos;t feel that way .
it &apos;s not only Spain fighting here .
it &apos;s Germany and Italy fighting Russia .
and the Spanish are right in the middle of it .
the Nazis and fascists are against democracy and against the communists .
they &apos;re using your country to test their new war machinery .
their tanks and dive-bombers . so they can destroy democracies like England ,
France and my country before we get armed and ready to fight .
were you always a Republican ?
and your father ?
- Sure . he always voted Republican .
did they shoot him for it ?
no . they don &apos;t shoot you for being a Republican in America .
Roberto was a professor . he told me this afternoon .
not a professor , María . an instructor .
that &apos;s the same thing . he was a teacher in a college .
the professor has no beard . he &apos;s a false professor .
shut up !
what did you teach , Inglés ?
Spanish . that &apos;s how I got to know Spain .
no beard . he has no beard . he &apos;s a false professor .
stop it !
- Wouldn &apos;t it be easier to teach English ?
why shouldn &apos;t he teach Spanish ?
doesn &apos;t he speak it ?
Yes , but in a way it is undignified for a foreigner to teach Spanish .
I mean nothing against you , Inglés .
he doesn &apos;t teach it to Spaniards !
- I should hope not ...
let me finish , you mule ! he teaches Spanish to Americans .
can &apos;t they speak Spanish ? - Mule !
north Americans speak English !
no beard , no beard .
- Enough !
but he &apos;s got no beard . beard ...
no beard . - He does have a beard .
you should know , girl .
pay no attention , Inglés . he &apos;s drunk .
- I don &apos;t think he &apos;s so drunk .
Yes . Yes , I am drunk .
I doubt it .
cowardly , yes !
you try to provoke me , Inglés ?
no , you won &apos;t get rid of me that way .
I said cowardly , not drunk !
see ?
see , I don &apos;t provoke .
signal to the woman that you &apos;ve failed .
Pilar had nothing to do with it . you spoke to the girl as a coward .
I don &apos;t provoke .
see , woman ?
I teach the professor I don &apos;t provoke .
I &apos;ll still be alive , when you &apos;re all dead !
I &apos;m not stupid .
I don &apos;t provoke .
I don &apos;t provoke .
to the Professor , to the Señora commander , and to all the illusioned ones .
that &apos;s silly . it &apos;s a waste of good wine .
I don &apos;t provoke .
I am drunk .
the wise man gets drunk to spend his time with fools .
get out !
Yeah .
Yeah , I go .
I &apos;ll go to the horses . they have more sense than men .
tell them about the bridge , Professor , and how to escape afterwards .
who will lead your patriots in the retreat ?
- Get out !
it &apos;s still falling , Inglés .
let me go ! I &apos;ll kill him !
- Give me that rifle !
why didn &apos;t you kill him last night ?
what do you think he &apos;ll do now ?
- He will toss a bomb in here .
give me your pistol . I &apos;ll shoot him .
- You want to blow us up ?
what fools we are !
- Why didn &apos;t you kill him last night ?
he &apos;s got to die now !
Pilar ?
what do you say , Pilar ?
Yes .
whatever you will ,
I &apos;m for it now .
then let all speak . Andrés , what do you say ?
Yes , kill him !
- Kill him .
Primitivo ?
- Kill him .
Agustín ?
- Do you need to ask ?
kill him !
Fernando ?
- Don &apos;t forget , Inglés , he &apos;s smart and he knows the mountains .
who will lead our retreat after the bridge ?
he knows the way . Pilar , tell him that El Sordo will lead us .
couldn &apos;t we hold him as a prisoner ?
- Who would look after him ?
he is right , Fernando . it would take us all to watch him .
why not sell him to the enemy ?
- Shut up , Gypsy .
that &apos;s filthy !
- No worse than Pablo .
if you &apos;d blind him , he will be easy to handle .
watch your tongue , Gypsy !
didn &apos;t Pablo blind the civil guard who was wounded ?
speak of blinding again and you go with Pablo .
Pilar , I haven &apos;t been allowed to finish yet .
finish , then , finish !
I still maintain we need Pablo .
we should reason with him and point out that his conduct ...
- Stop it !
even here one man can make a bureaucracy with his mouth !
you &apos;ve voted to kill him . now have done with it !
kill him when he returns .
- He must make the first move .
why wait ? kill him !
- In cold blood ?
- You Ingleses are all cold .
give me your gun !
I &apos;m burning !
not in here . no shooting in here .
you &apos;ll see how cold my blood is when that coward comes back !
ugly . all of it &apos;s ugly !
remember one thing , Inglés . he wasn &apos;t always like this .
when the war broke out , he wasn &apos;t the man you see now .
brutal , yes , but a leader without fear .
without Pablo &apos;s help , the Nationalists would have taken our town the day the revolution began , for many Nationalists lived there .
but Pablo organized the people , and in the night all suspects were dragged from their beds and locked up in the city hall .
in the dark , he surrounded the police barracks , cut the telephone wires and placed dynamite under the wall .
when morning came , he called on the civil guards to surrender , but they wouldn &apos;t .
so he blew the wall open .
but then there was a shout for us to stop firing and four civil guards walked out with their hands up .
Pablo said , &quot; Show us how to die , you who have always done the killing . &quot;
&quot; what are you going to do ? &quot; , the officer asked . &quot; shoot you . &quot;
Pablo passed behind them .
I can hear the pistol even now and see the head of each man fall .
one held his head still when the pistol touched it .
one shivered in his whole body and his head was shaking .
only one put his hands in front of his eyes and he was the last one .
the hat fell from his head and Pablo said , &quot; Pilar , he &apos;s polite .
he takes off his hat for a woman like you ! &quot;
a crowd was gathering in the plaza before the city hall .
&quot; why is it done this way ? &quot; , they asked Pablo .
&quot; to save bullets , &quot; he said , &quot; and to make all of you share in it . &quot;
I had picked up that hat and a man said ,
&quot; Pilar , that &apos;s bad taste . we &apos;re done with civil guards now . &quot;
Drunkards yelled , as if at a bullfight ,
&quot; let the bull out ! Pablo , let the bull out ! &quot;
and then everyone shouted , &quot; Here comes the first one ! &quot;
it was Don Perito García , the mayor .
he walked between the lines and nothing happened .
he passed two men , four men , eight men , and nothing happened .
from the roof someone shouted , &quot; What &apos;s the matter , coward ? &quot;
but nothing happened .
I was watching one man who had a dispute with the mayor about a piece of land , and who hated him .
and it was this man who first raised his flail .
don Faustino Rivera was known as an annoyer of girls .
he wanted to be known as a bullfighter and went much with them and Gypsies .
but he was a coward and was considered a joke .
but he was inspired by the example of Don García and he stood there looking handsome and brave , and he made his face scornful .
now the lines began to shout , &quot; Listen Don Faustino , there are beautiful girls over the cliff , why don &apos;t you chase them ? &quot;
it was then I knew that the lines had become savage , caused by the insult of Don García and the cowardice of Don Faustino .
don Guillermo wasn &apos;t a bad man . he was only in politics because of his wife .
I heard her screaming , &quot; Guillermo , husband , wait .
he couldn &apos;t see her without his glasses , but he looked up and waved .
and no one would hit him .
then a drunkard yelled , &quot; Guillermo ! &quot;
&quot; what bothers Pilar ? &quot; , they asked me .
&quot; I &apos;m sick , &quot; I told them .
and they said , &quot; Us too . we &apos;ll take no further part in it . &quot;
but the worst was yet to come , Inglés , when Pablo opened the city hall door and let the mob in to kill the rest .
for yes , it was now a mob , lacking any organization .
the snow has stopped , Inglés .
now we &apos;ll have good weather for the bridge .
Yes , I &apos;ve come back to help you .
I cannot desert Pilar and my people .
wait , man !
what trick is this , drunkard ?
- No trick , Pilar .
I &apos;ve changed my mind , that &apos;s all .
you &apos;re right about the bridge and I &apos;m with you now .
you &apos;ll need me for the retreat .
- Just what I said .
you were listening !
you &apos;re afraid of being killed . that &apos;s why you &apos;ve changed .
do you think I like to hear how we killed those men ?
if I could bring them back to life , I &apos;d do it .
- Liar !
no , I mean it . I wish I could bring them back to life , even Don Ricardo who cursed me .
- Stop it !
Yes , I would restore them all to life . that &apos;s God &apos;s truth .
and it &apos;s also true that I &apos;m with you now .
I was drunk .
now I &apos;m not drunk and I &apos;ve changed my mind .
either trust me or not , but no one can get you to the Gredos as I can .
I believe you . but take an oath .
are you with us and for the bridge ?
- Yes , man .
you think it can be successful despite the snow ?
- There will be no snow .
you have confidence ?
why not ?
fools ! Lunatics !
you &apos;re all crazy if you believe him !
what , Roberto ?
- A trooper .
what does it mean ?
- I don &apos;t know .
see anything ?
- No .
are you sure it was a trooper ?
- Yes .
where &apos;s Pablo ?
- In the cave .
man , what a horse !
- Never mind , get in the saddle .
this horse must make tracks out again .
- You have much sense , Inglés .
I &apos;ll ride him in the hills until the snow &apos;s melted .
keep your eyes open . there &apos;s bound to be more cavalry .
get the machine gun and my binoculars . we &apos;ve got to cover the pass .
both of you give him a hand .
go back to that soldier and see if you can find more clips .
and leave his pockets alone !
Roberto !
Roberto , I &apos;m coming with you !
go back .
tell Pilar to pack . we may have to run for it .
- No .
go back , María .
there may be a fight .
- I &apos;ll help you .
- No !
let me help you .
- Go back !
let me go with you . I want to help .
- Then go back !
kiss me .
you &apos;re shameless .
- Yes .
what &apos;s happened to that Gypsy ?
- I saw him coming down .
then he saw a rabbit and went after it .
fine time to go hunting . Primitivo , climb up that rock as high as you can .
if you see soldiers , throw a stone for a signal . wait .
if you see one soldier , raise your rifle like this .
- Like this ?
if more than one , pump it like this . one for each soldier . understand ?
Yes .
Anselmo , go to Agustín and hold the gun &apos;s legs , if I have to shoot .
here , hold this for me .
- For what ?
- I &apos;m liable to shoot me a Gypsy .
look ! now we &apos;ll have fresh meat .
see ?
does something annoy Roberto ?
if you weren &apos;t a Gypsy , I &apos;d shoot you !
- But why ?
look at how fat they are !
get down !
rifles !
- Now the soldiers are hunting .
wait here .
is it Pablo ?
- El Sordo .
come , Inglés , now they need us .
- Where ?
- To join in with El Sordo .
to die there ?
don &apos;t you realize they &apos;re lost ?
it &apos;s too risky . we have to think about the bridge .
why that &apos;s our friend El Sordo !
- Listen ...
- I listen to that !
are you afraid to fight for our friends ?
Roberto !
we could hear the firing at the cave . I was afraid ...
you shouldn &apos;t have come here .
- I let her . she was half crazy .
she thought you were fighting .
- Why aren &apos;t we fighting ?
they want to go to El Sordo .
- Have you lost your minds ?
what kind of locos are you ?
men , not women !
- Then act like men !
you &apos;ll die soon enough .
- Swallow your tongue and choke !
silence !
what use is courage if you have no head ?
El Sordo has both . he &apos;ll understand .
was he coming with the horses ?
looks like he did his best to lead them away from us .
did you hit him ?
- Pot full of grease-backed bat .
I &apos;ll tell you who &apos;s a pot full of grease :
Pilar . she knows we are dying here .
what could Pilar do ?
- Take them from the rear .
- How ?
they &apos;re all around the hill . 100 , 200 ... maybe more now .
Bandidos , cobardes !
can you hear me ?
you sons of four-legged devils !
surrender now , you bandits , before our planes blow you to bits !
will they send planes ?
with bombs or machine guns ?
- Both , my son .
I &apos;m giving you a chance to surrender before the planes come .
you hear what I am saying , bandidos ?
let &apos;s insult him . maybe he &apos;ll show his head .
do you surrender ?
- Who has a big pistol ?
- Here .
the planes are coming ! do you surrender ?
he can &apos;t wait for the planes .
he wants to be a hero , to lead us back with a rope around our necks .
have you seen any movement since the shots ?
- No sir .
what do you think ?
- I don &apos;t believe it .
why shouldn &apos;t they do it ?
they knew they had to die .
it &apos;s better than being bombed or captured , isn &apos;t it ?
I think it &apos;s a trick .
what about the planes ?
they should have come a long time ago .
how many shots did you count ?
- Five . - It &apos;s ridiculous if they are dead !
ridiculous to hide down here from dead men !
I think we should wait for the planes , sir .
fire , cowards , if you are alive !
fire on a man who has no fear of you !
shoot , you saffron-bellied swine !
now do you believe me ? no one &apos;s alive up there .
you ! go up and see .
don &apos;t you hear me ?
- Yes , my captain .
- Then go !
do you hear me ?
- Yes , my captain .
- Why don &apos;t you go then ?
I don &apos;t want to , my captain .
- You don &apos;t want to ?
I &apos;m afraid , my captain .
- Captain Mora !
- Lieutenant Berrendo !
it is possible the soldier is right .
- Right to say he &apos;s afraid ?
right to say he wants to disobey ?
- No sir . right that it &apos;s a trick !
don &apos;t you hear me , they &apos;re all dead .
- You mean our comrades on the slope ?
I agree , sir .
- Very well , the sniper stays here .
I &apos;ll take care of him later . you and I will go to the top .
not me .
- What ?
- I will go if you order me .
but under protest .
no , I &apos;ll go alone .
the smell of cowardice is too strong here .
assassins !
cowards !
shoot me !
kill me !
can you hear me coming ?
no , you can &apos;t hear me coming .
you think I &apos;m a coward like the others ?
shoot me !
kill me ! - &quot; Shoot me !
kill me ! &quot;
cowards !
- Look at him coming .
scum of the earth !
- What an animal ! - Shoot me if you are alive !
look at him stride .
- Bandidos !
- This one is for me .
do you hear me ?
- This one we take with us .
- No , you don &apos;t hear .
keep walking .
- Cowards !
look at the stars . he &apos;s a captain . stick out your chest , little captain .
I will kill you with a bullet ! - Don &apos;t stop . don &apos;t be late , captain .
you vermin !
- A long voyage ...
fire ! cowards ! if you are alive !
now comrade voyager , close enough . come on , voyager .
can you hear me coming ?
no , you can &apos;t hear me coming .
I am coming .
&quot; kill me !
shoot me ! &quot;
Joaquín !
quick !
a little higher !
Pilar !
Pilar !
Hola , Pilar .
- Hola .
Salud , Roberto .
- Salud .
Salud , Pilar .
look at him . already at the wine !
did you come back for us , or the wine ?
- Both .
he came back for his horses .
much riding , Inglés . I couldn &apos;t turn back till the snow has melted .
didn &apos;t you run into the cavalry ?
- A good horse , the new one .
I took to high ground and came back through the hills .
no food , Pilar ? where have you been ?
- Guarding the pass below .
we had to wait until there was no more cavalry .
Inglés !
Inglés !
I was with El Sordo .
you were in the fight ?
- No .
on my way back here ...
it was dark and I went up the hill .
five dead at the top . they &apos;d taken their heads .
Joaquín too ?
no heads ...
- Now let the fighting come .
no heads .
- Inglés !
Anselmo says there is much movement across the bridge .
I was just leaving the lookout when it started .
guns , trucks , armored cars , even tanks .
- Tanks ?
everything moving up toward the front . I marked it all down .
I waited till the second column had crossed .
- Anything more coming ?
Yes , I could hear another column as I came up through the pass .
should I go back ? - Not now .
were these trucks full of soldiers ?
Yes . what does it mean ?
they know the Republic is going to attack when the sun rises .
Yes , now they know . they move up to meet our offensive .
who knows the way through to the Republicans ?
- I do .
I need you at the bridge . who else ?
- I know it .
have you been through before ?
- Twice . - 8 hours , nearly 9 hours .
can you make it to Navacerrada ?
- I can try .
I could do it in less time , with luck and no pack .
- I need you here .
our route was longer because we carried explosive . it was safer .
I will get there as well as another . and something could happen to anyone .
this dispatch is for General Golz . remember the name , &quot; Golz &quot; .
where will I find him ?
- Ask when you get to our lines .
this seal ought to get you through . if you have problems , show this here .
you &apos;ve got seven hours at the most . the attack is set for sunrise .
I prefer to be with you at the bridge .
- Get this to General Golz and we won &apos;t have to blow the bridge .
we &apos;ll all escape to the Gredos safely .
remember , the bridge &apos;s got to go if the attack starts .
Pablo !
Pablo , come back !
Pilar !
Pablo has gone !
didn &apos;t I tell you he was a coward ?
you and your confidence !
if it wasn &apos;t for you , I would have killed him last night !
I have been betrayed .
- Betrayed !
listen to him !
he has been betrayed !
you fool !
no slanders , please !
- Forget it !
I &apos;m the one to blame .
Andrés , you better get going . and good luck .
should I go back and guard the horses ?
fool !
- No . I &apos;ll look after them .
who will lead the retreat now ?
- Shut up , Gypsy !
Andrés will get to the general .
- Get back in the cave .
Pilar , get everything ready for the bridge . and get some sleep .
I &apos;ll look after the horses . look after my things .
Salud !
don &apos;t shoot , comrades .
- Who are you ?
a comrade , Andrés Lopez , with a dispatch for General Golz .
say the password , if you &apos;re a comrade !
- I don &apos;t know any password .
toss a bomb at him .
- No , that would be a great mistake .
he &apos;s not alone , Pedro .
toss a bomb ! - No .
please .
I &apos;m completely by myself .
allow me to show you my papers .
sure you &apos;re alone ?
- How many times must I to tell you ?
stand up !
put your hands above your head !
come on !
I &apos;m in a big hurry . I have a dispatch for General Golz at Navacerrada .
where ?
- Inside my shirt . how can I show it to you with my hands up ?
you &apos;re a long way from Navacerrada . I will take you to Captain Gómez .
spy !
I brought your robe . I &apos;ll fix it for you .
was this your idea or Pilar &apos;s ?
mine . but Pilar told me to come .
even if she &apos;d told me not to come , I would have come .
will there be fighting tomorrow ?
- Are you afraid ?
I &apos;m afraid for you so much I do not think of me .
Pilar told me that I &apos;m to go with you , after the bridge .
that you &apos;ll take me to the Republic .
- You and Pilar will have horses .
you &apos;ll be safe with Pilar . that leaves 3 horses for the others .
but I go with you , not Pilar .
I came on foot with the old man and shall go the same way .
- No !
Pilar says no one will get out alive without a horse .
but if Andrés gets through , there will be no bridge , will there ?
will there , Roberto ?
no .
maybe I should &apos;ve sent word sooner about the movements here .
how much time have we left ?
a lifetime , María .
I mean until daylight .
five , six hours .
Pilar told me that time is not important .
maybe Pilar &apos;s right .
three days and three nights . yet they &apos;re everything .
longer than the months in prison . longer than the years I &apos;ve lived .
she told me something else when I left the cave :
&quot; we must live all our life in the time that remains . &quot;
she said ... - What ?
what did she tell you ?
- We would all die tomorrow .
and that you know it too .
- She &apos;s crazy .
nothing more than Gypsy superstition .
you don &apos;t believe it ?
- Of course not .
she had a reason for telling me .
she said I must tell you all that happened to me when they shot my mother and father .
you &apos;ve told me .
- No .
no , I didn &apos;t tell you what happened when they herded us up the hill and to the barber shop .
- I don &apos;t want to hear it .
two men looked at me and one said ,
&quot; that &apos;s the daughter of the mayor . &quot;
the other said , &quot; Commence with her . &quot; they took me to the barber shop and put me in the chair and held me .
in the mirror I could only see my mother and my father at the moment of the shooting .
my mother &apos;s words were in my head like a scream that went on and on .
and I could fell a pain .
they were pulling at my hair and cutting it off with a razor .
and then they put the braids in my mouth ... and tied them around my neck to make a gag .
then they ran clippers across my head .
I commenced to cry , because until then I &apos;d been too frozen to feel anything .
in the mirror , I could see the men laugh .
I couldn &apos;t look away from the horror my face made with braids in my mouth .
when they took me out , I stumbled over the dead barber .
they had shot him because he belonged to a union .
then I saw my best friend being dragged in by two more men .
when she saw me , she screamed .
she screamed the whole time they were shoving me across the square and into the doorway and up the stairs of the city hall , to the office of my father , where they put me on the couch .
the worst things were done there .
- Quiet . don &apos;t think about it .
I was going to tell you on the way back from El Sordo , but I was glad when you wouldn &apos;t let me .
then I was happy , as if it had never happened .
no . tonight , Pilar said I must tell you everything .
and now you won &apos;t love me .
tomorrow you &apos;ll take me through the lines and I &apos;ll never see you again .
never . you won &apos;t want me .
no , Roberto , we can &apos;t change things .
but it &apos;s true I never kissed any man until you .
when it happened I fought until they tied my arms .
- No one &apos;s touched you !
you believe that ?
- I know that .
and you can love me ?
I can love you more .
I could see your headlight from afar . you want to bring down a shelling ?
where is the lieutenant colonel ?
- He &apos;s asleep . who is the bandit ?
he bears a dispatch for General Golz who commands the attack .
you &apos;re crazy . I know no General Golz , nor no attack .
get back to your battalion .
- Call the lieutenant colonel .
away !
call him !
all you barbers are emotional . orderly !
call the lieutenant colonel . don &apos;t forget , I &apos;m your superior officer .
I &apos;m not afraid of your threats . cynics like you would be eliminated ...
&quot; first &quot; is the word you want .
- As long as they liquidate you .
&quot; Liquidated &quot; is a word foreign to Spain .
- Shot , then !
that &apos;s Spanish , can you understand it ?
- Yes , but don &apos;t talk so loud !
your emotions bore me .
Hello , Gómez .
- Colonel .
what brings you ?
why didn &apos;t this get here sooner ?
- Stupidity .
I &apos;m not sure you can get through now .
write them a very strong safe-conduct . you &apos;ll need something strong tonight .
we &apos;re careful before an offensive .
you know what I &apos;ve been thinking about ?
what I should do to take care of you well .
I &apos;ll learn from Pilar and other things you can tell me .
what about me taking care of myself ?
- But you don &apos;t .
you should have hung out your sleeping robe in the sun this morning .
before the dew comes , it should have been taken in .
your socks should be washed . I would see that you have two pairs .
what else ?
this . I would learn how to fire it .
that &apos;s easy . I &apos;ll teach you .
- Then if you &apos;re wounded ,
I could kill you and then myself .
do you have many ideas like that ?
no , not many .
but it &apos;s a good one in this war .
Pilar gave me this one and showed me how to use it .
I always keep it with me .
- Razor blade ?
she says there &apos;s no pain if you press quickly and firmly .
and they can &apos;t stop it if it &apos;s done .
not if you cut the artery . how long have you had it ?
ever since I was rescued .
but I &apos;d rather have you shoot me .
promise me if there &apos;s ever any need that you will shoot me .
sure . I promise .
thank you very much . I know it &apos;s not easy to do .
but there are other things I can do for you .
besides shoot me ?
I can roll cigarettes when your box is empty .
- Without spilling tobacco ?
- Yes .
and if you &apos;re wounded , I &apos;ll take care of you , wash you and feed you .
maybe I won &apos;t be wounded .
- If you &apos;re sick ,
I &apos;ll make soup and read to you .
- Maybe I won &apos;t get sick .
then I &apos;ll bring you coffee .
- Maybe I don &apos;t like coffee .
this morning you had two cups .
- Suppose I get tired of coffee ,
I &apos;m not wounded or sick , I give up smoking , have only one pair of socks , and roll up my robe myself .
then I &apos;ll cut your hair with Pilar &apos;s scissors .
- I don &apos;t like that .
neither do I. I like your hair the way it is .
so if there &apos;s nothing to do for you , I &apos;ll sit by you and watch you .
and in the nights we &apos;ll make love .
you are shameless .
if you don &apos;t love me , I love you enough for both .
I was asleep .
I &apos;m sorry I woke up .
I didn &apos;t know I was sleeping .
it was so beautiful in your house .
- My house ?
- Yes .
in America .
the one you told me about . where you were a little boy .
does the stairway turn at the top , like this ?
and there is the door to your mother &apos;s room ? Yes , that &apos;s how it was .
your mother was there , and your grandfather who fought in the American Civil War .
he was there , just as you described him . I liked him very much .
and I loved your mother .
she was holding a child who looked exactly like my Roberto .
when I asked her whose son it was , she said , &quot; Why , it &apos;s yours , María . &quot;
that &apos;s why I had to look at you .
- Maybe you weren &apos;t dreaming .
no , I was there , just as real as I &apos;m here now .
can &apos;t you wait till I take you there ?
- Oh Roberto , that , too , is like a dream , like a wonderful dream .
my hair amuses you because it &apos;s odd . but every day it &apos;s growing .
and it will be long and I will not look ugly .
perhaps you will love me very much .
all the things you &apos;ve told me tonight , it &apos;s ... it &apos;s as if you &apos;d already taken me to Madrid and to America .
that &apos;s just the beginning . wait till this war is over .
do I please you ? will you always take me with you ?
unless you run away from me .
- No , I &apos;ll never go away from you .
I loved you when I first saw you ,
I always have , though I never saw you before .
now I &apos;m your woman . I &apos;ll always be your woman .
always !
where is the headquarters of General Golz of the 35th division ?
not here .
- I was told he was in the vicinity .
what is here ?
the comandancia .
- Of what ? - Who are you ?
Captain Gómez of the 65th brigade and I ask where is General Golz .
I can hear the wind in the trees .
now it will soon be light .
will we ever come back ?
some day , María .
and stay here again ?
- Some day .
do you think Andrés got through ?
we can &apos;t tell until sunrise .
are you afraid ?
not now .
I love you , Roberto . always remember .
I love you as I love my father and mother , as I love our unborn children , as I love what I love most in the world , and I love you more .
always remember .
I &apos;ll remember .
nothing can ever part us now , can it ?
nothing , María .
Inglés !
Inglés !
what is it , Pilar ?
what &apos;s wrong ?
it must have been Pablo !
- Pablo &apos;s gone . what do you mean ?
your exploder !
the box that explodes the dynamite .
when I stirred up the fire for coffee , I found it .
what ?
- It was under the ashes .
- I thought you were guarding it .
I slept with your things !
- You slept well !
he must have done it last night before we got back .
maybe it will work again .
is there no other way to explode the charges ?
- Yes , sure .
a bad way , but I can do it .
that swine !
what is the way , Inglés ?
- Get me your hand grenades .
do they always explode ?
- Yes , but not strong enough .
I didn &apos;t ask that . have they always exploded ?
- Always .
I &apos;ve brought 3 more men from the band of Elias .
- Traitor .
I &apos;ve come back , Pilar , and I &apos;ve brought more men for the bridge .
did you do that ?
- I had a moment of weakness .
kill him , Inglés !
Yes , I meant to leave .
having seen what happened to El Sordo , I was afraid to die .
but having done such a thing , I was lonely .
do you understand loneliness ?
- I understand cowardice !
don &apos;t mock me , woman . don &apos;t you see I &apos;ve come back ?
I &apos;ve thought of a way to explode the dynamite .
so have I .
the only reason I don &apos;t shoot you is because we need you .
I &apos;ve brought more men for the bridge , Inglés .
they think I &apos;m still the leader here . or they wouldn &apos;t have followed me .
you are if you wish . for the fighting .
I suppose when a man has something once , always something remains .
our men are waiting below . tell them we &apos;re coming .
don &apos;t worry about the retreat . now we have three more horses .
and three more men !
- Maybe they won &apos;t need their horses .
you have much control , Inglés .
I &apos;m glad he &apos;s back . no matter what he is , we need him .
one last thing I must tell you . in that thing of the hand ...
what thing of the hand ?
- No , listen . don &apos;t be angry .
when I looked in your hand , it was just Gypsy humbug .
Gypsies do that to make themselves important .
- Sure , sure . forget it .
I don &apos;t want you to worry .
- Who &apos;s worrying ?
the truth is , I saw only happiness for you and the cropped head .
I know that . and I don &apos;t need a nurse .
I care for you very much , Inglés . remember that and don &apos;t worry .
everything will go well at the bridge .
- Sure . let &apos;s go .
get your things together .
are the orders clear now ?
- Yes .
take the road-mender &apos;s hut , destroy the post and stop anything from getting through to the bridge .
right . but not a move unless you hear the falling of bombs .
- Yeah . clear ?
you , Pilar , the same with the sawmill . don &apos;t shoot unless we hear the bombs .
don &apos;t alarm the sentries unless you hear the bombs .
don &apos;t worry about the retreat , Inglés . we &apos;ll have plenty of horses .
get along before he steals the rest of your things .
you don &apos;t understand me , woman . we understand each other .
nobody understands you . neither God , nor your mother , nor I .
nor you , either .
come .
Goodbye . see you soon .
Goodbye , Roberto . take much care .
- Of course .
don &apos;t cry .
no , I don &apos;t .
but come back to me .
- I will .
don &apos;t worry if you hear firing .
only come back quickly .
Bye , María .
Salud , Roberto .
get across the gorge and don &apos;t fire unless I do .
when the sentry is eliminated , come to the middle of the bridge .
it is all clear to me .
I will do as you order .
when you fire , don &apos;t think of it as a man , but as a target .
and if anything happens to me , you &apos;ll have to finish the job as I showed you .
go now .
until soon , Roberto .
- Until soon , Anselmo .
Captain Gómez , 65th brigade . an urgent dispatch for General Golz .
why didn &apos;t this get here sooner ?
- Stupidity and crazy suspicion .
General Golz !
urgent !
but I just spoke to him .
Segovia ?
I &apos;ll try there .
no , no , no !
get me position Ávila !
where &apos;s General Golz ?
planes 1 ?
get me Planes 1 !
- Can &apos;t you call the airfield ?
General Golz !
not there ?
I called Segovia !
get me Segovia again ! quick , man !
- Stop the bombardment !
you think I want to get shot ?
Yes , Golz .
Golz !
General Golz ?
from Jordan ?
Yes , read it .
what ?
too late , Duval !
that means we &apos;re done for . this time we fail .
too bad .
Yes , too bad .
rope !
hand grenade .
other side !
please have him be all right because all my heart is at the bridge .
please bring him back to me , and I &apos;ll do anything you say , ever .
because there isn &apos;t any me . I &apos;m only with him .
please take care of him for me . take care of him !
forgive me , for I &apos;m very confused ... but if you take care of him , I &apos;ll do whatever is right .
but this not knowing , I cannot endure it .
Pablo , I got me a ... a tank !
one .
- Two .
- Three .
four !
now take the wire back as far as it will reach before I connect it .
Roberto !
hurry , Roberto !
hurry !
blow it , Anselmo !
- No , I can &apos;t !
you &apos;ll be ...
pull it , I tell you !
- No , Roberto !
María !
María !
your Inglés is alright .
hear me ? he &apos;s alright .
Yes , thank you . thank you .
thank you very much .
Roberto !
the old one ?
- Dad .
we lost Fernando .
- If I &apos;d had only had the exploder .
what &apos;s with Pablo ?
- Maybe he can &apos;t leave .
then let us leave ! the devil with him !
- Wait ! he &apos;ll be back if he &apos;s able .
machine gun .
here comes the ...
plenty of horses now , Inglés !
where &apos;s Fernando ?
and the old man ?
where are the three men of Elias ?
what were you shooting in the gorge ?
why don &apos;t you say you shot them ?
- Shut up !
- Answer me !
I look after my own people .
and the men of Elias ?
- They were not our people .
I provide horses for my people !
- We have horses to spare .
Yeah ?
how did I know we would have three killed !
now , shut up !
I lead the retreat .
no !
- Don &apos;t be stubborn , woman .
watch the María .
- Watch yourself .
look !
there they are !
wait for the next shot , then go hard before they can reload .
- No .
now !
- No !
Roberto !
Roberto !
let me go !
Roberto !
what is it ?
is it ...
- It &apos;s broken .
- Can you ride ?
get me a strip of canvas . tear it from one of the packs .
- Yes .
get me the machine gun . you can make it if I hold &apos; em here .
no , Inglés . we &apos;ll carry you .
don &apos;t argue . I can &apos;t ride . I couldn &apos;t even sit on a horse .
I &apos;d pass out . Pablo know I &apos;m right .
I want to talk to María alone . but when I tell you to take her , do it .
talk fast , Inglés . the soldiers will soon be coming .
María , listen , don &apos;t say anything .
we won &apos;t be going to America this time .
but always I go with you wherever you go . understand ?
you go now , María .
- No , I stay with you , Roberto .
no , María . what I do now , I do alone .
no . - If you go , then I go too . Whichever one there is , is both .
no . no , I stay with you .
- No , each of us must do this thing alone .
do it for each other . but if you go , then I go with you .
I know you &apos;ll go now , María , for both of us , because we love each other always .
it &apos;s easier for me to stay with you , Roberto .
I know it &apos;s harder for you . but now I am you also .
if you go , I go too . that &apos;s the only way I can go .
you &apos;re me now . surely you must feel that , María .
remember last night ?
our time is &quot; now &quot; and it &apos;ll never end .
no .
- You &apos;re me now and I am you .
now you understand . now you &apos;re going .
you &apos;re going well and fast and far .
we &apos;ll go to America another time , María .
stand up now and go . and we both go .
stand up . remember , you &apos;re me too .
you &apos;re all there will be ever be of me now . stand up .
no . stand up .
there &apos;s no goodbye , María , because we &apos;re not apart .
Pilar !
don &apos;t turn around .
go now . be strong .
take care of our life .
no , Pilar , I can &apos;t go !
no !
Oh Roberto !
Roberto , let me stay , please ! please don &apos;t make me go !
no , Roberto , no !
God , that was lucky I could make her go .
I don &apos;t mind this at all now . they &apos;re away .
think how it would be if they &apos;d got María instead of you .
don &apos;t pass out , Jordan .
think about America .
I can &apos;t .
think about Madrid .
I can &apos;t .
think about María .
I can do that .
no , you fool !
you weren &apos;t kidding María about that talk of &quot; now &quot; !
now they can &apos;t stop us , ever ! she &apos;s going on with me ! right !
U.S. tank detachment Unit 5 . repeat message .
U.S. tank detachment Unit 5 . repeat .
- Over to you , over .
retreat has been ordered in all sectors .
surviving units note that points east , west and north are under enemy control .
over to you .
I don &apos;t understand . to the south ?
all points east , west and north under enemy control .
okay , but what do we do ?
what &apos;s the order ?
good luck to you , Yank . over to you .
what ?
good luck to you , Yank .
in your own language , scram !
okay . why didn &apos;t you say so in the first place ?
Hey , sarge ! Hey , sarge !
sergeant Gunn !
hurry up , sarge !
orders came through . hurry up !
okay , keep your shirt on !
all right , Waco ?
let &apos;s go !
Hey , sarge !
we got to get out of here , and quick !
it just came over . East , west and north under enemy control .
General retreat ordered .
East , west and north . they got us boxed in .
that &apos;s south , but there &apos;s nothing there but sand and rock .
any place is healthier than this . let &apos;s move !
come down here and give us a hand !
what &apos;ll we do if we can &apos;t get this cement mixer rolling ?
lay off that cement mixer stuff .
give me that gadget .
get in there .
hold that down while I bolt it .
think she &apos;ll pull us out ?
it depends on the way we handle her . it &apos;s like a dame .
but no dame ever said anything as sweet as this motor will sound when she gets rolling .
keep that up and they &apos;re liable to hit us .
there . that ought to hold her .
all right , get around . start it up .
he &apos;s got a touch like an elephant .
he don &apos;t feed her enough .
it &apos;s like a dame . don &apos;t feed them , they won &apos;t do nothing .
that &apos;s no way to treat her . let me in there .
okay , Joe .
she &apos;s dead .
five he starts it ?
you got a bet .
come on now , baby .
get going and get us out of here .
I &apos;ll buy you the sweetest coat of paint you ever had in your life .
come on now , Lulubelle , let &apos;s go .
Hatch is up .
sarge , two guys ahead .
- What do you make of them ?
- They look British .
it might be a Nazi trick .
remember that phony white flag at Bir Hacheim ?
I wouldn &apos;t bet they were British if they waved a roast beef .
keep them covered till I find out who they are .
master Sergeant Gunn , U.S. Army Tank Detachment .
Captain Halliday , Royal Army Medical Corps .
nice to see you .
I had 42 wounded there .
when the Stukas finished with us , I had 42 dead .
these men were kind enough to help search the wreckage .
it was no use .
what are you looking at ?
Oh , help yourself .
Merci bien . American cigarette , I don &apos;t see for a long time .
pass them around .
- Talks like a Yank . - How else would I talk ?
we &apos;ve been expecting you a long time .
ours was one of the first tanks here .
how many men do you have , sergeant ?
two . Radioman and machine gunner .
I lost the rest of my crew .
I suppose you &apos;re trying to rejoin your detachment ?
it &apos;s too late .
- Too late ?
- What are you talking about ?
haven &apos;t you heard ?
a general retreat &apos;s been ordered .
that &apos;s not true !
listen to that firing .
our chaps are still at it not far away .
they &apos;re mopping up what &apos;s left of them .
if we cut south far enough we can hook up with another outfit .
you don &apos;t know that part of the desert . it &apos;s the worst in Libya .
you won &apos;t get anywhere in that scow .
soon as it &apos;s daylight , they &apos;ll blast the gizzards out of her .
I &apos;m sorry you feel that way about her .
a good tank with a full crew has a better chance than men on foot .
- That &apos;s a matter of opinion . - They &apos;ll get you .
- We &apos;ll get them first . - For what they did to the hospital .
I &apos;d sooner stick it out than run away in a tin hearse .
there &apos;s three things wrong with that statement .
first , we &apos;re not running , we &apos;re obeying orders .
second , she &apos;s not made of tin and third , she &apos;s no hearse .
she &apos;s an M3 that can cross 200 miles of desert as easy you &apos;d walk around that Piccadilly Circus of yours .
I &apos;m not going to argue with you .
stick around , let the Nazis mop you up .
spend the rest of the war in a Berlin prison camp , but not me .
when I go into Berlin , I &apos;ll be riding that tank .
same one that &apos;s standing there with the name Lulubelle on her .
sergeant !
I &apos;ll go with you .
what makes you want to go ?
I like your cigarettes .
all right . get inside .
I &apos;m sorry I blew up just now , sir .
but that crack that guy made about my tank kind of burned me .
she &apos;s a good tank .
I &apos;ll tell you again . we got it over the radio .
we &apos;re surrounded . the only way out is south .
that &apos;s the way we &apos;re going .
good luck , sir .
wait a minute , sergeant !
we &apos;re coming with you !
hurry up !
here you are , sir .
come on , fellas !
it &apos;s a peculiar thing .
a sergeant is the same in every army in the world .
what ?
!
a sergeant &apos;s the same in every army in the world !
you don &apos;t know Joe . he &apos;s a smart guy .
I don &apos;t think the sergeant is a very tender man .
I don &apos;t think the sergeant is a very tender man .
but he named his tank after someone he loves .
- Yeah , a horse !
- A what ?
a horse !
he loves a horse .
sarge was in the cavalry way back .
- The what ?
- The cavalry !
the cavalry .
something wrong ?
I think I cut the mixture a little too thin , trying to save gas .
he &apos;s making a mistake , going this direction .
the sarge knows what he &apos;s doing .
Yes , the sergeant &apos;s a genius !
he &apos;s a miracle man .
when we run out of water , he strikes a rock like Moses and water falls out .
he hits it twice and the water &apos;s turned into wine .
suppose we get stuck in this graveyard without any water .
Waco , open that hatch , will you ?
all right , come down for a while .
what &apos;s the matter , Waco ?
the motor .
starving you to death , huh ?
we got to save gas , same as we save water .
sarge , got to grease the wheels .
make it quick , we got to keep moving .
try that radio again , Jimmy .
we &apos;ll go in a minute .
eat something , and drink 1 / 3 cup of water .
be sure to measure with the cup .
get anything ?
nothing but static and Heil Hitler !
no contact , so we don &apos;t know where the army will be .
at the worst , the line will be anchored at Tobruk .
- We should circle like this . - Will our petrol hold out ?
I figure we got about enough for 160 miles .
water , I &apos;m worried about .
I &apos;ve got to find one of those wells .
they call them wells on the map .
but most of them are only dried up mudholes full of sand .
wish I could put my feet in a nice big bucket of water .
must be 1000 centigrade in these boots .
my throat needs it worse than my feet .
- I suffer from corns . - I &apos;m fed up with your feet .
so am I. Been fed up with them for years .
- Did you finish , Waco ? - Not yet .
why you call him Waco ?
it &apos;s a city in Texas .
we call it &quot; The City With a Soul . &quot;
why ?
come to think of it , I never figured why .
we got a sign on the biggest building :
&quot; city With a Soul . &quot;
how about another city with a soul ? Paris .
you from Paris , Frenchie ?
no , but for every Frenchman , Paris is the soul . la France .
all my life I &apos;ve wanted to go to Paris .
sometime , maybe we &apos;ll go there .
I &apos;d like to go home .
you fellas like to see a photo of a beautiful girl ?
- She &apos;s pretty . what &apos;s her name ?
- Kathy .
very nice .
she &apos;s a corker .
I told you to measure that water in a cup .
- I wasn &apos;t thinking . - I &apos;ll do the thinking for you .
Frenchie , bring the canteens to me .
we &apos;ve got our own officer . I &apos;ll take my orders from him .
I &apos;m glad you brought that up , Williams .
I &apos;ve something to say to the men , sergeant .
we &apos;ve only one purpose .
to save ourselves so that we can fight again .
we &apos;ve got to work together and have discipline .
sergeant Gunn was in command when we joined him .
he &apos;s an experienced soldier and it seems proper to ask him to continue in that capacity .
I shall confer with him on the safety and conduct of the expedition but immediate authority will rest with him .
my canteen , sergeant .
thank you , sir .
here you are , Frenchie .
what do you make of them ?
that &apos;s what I &apos;m trying to figure out .
Hey , Waco .
fire shots in front of them . that ought to turn them back into us .
that &apos;s a British Sudanese with an Italian prisoner .
I think he &apos;s going to fight us .
give me something white to wave .
make it snappy .
it is true , Bimbashi . I thought I &apos;d captured an enemy tank .
where &apos;d you get this prisoner ?
at Bir Hacheim .
a column of many tanks and many machines attacked us there .
all my company died in battle . I alone escaped .
it was then I captured this man to carry my pack .
what is your name ?
sergeant Major Tambul . force Sudanese Battalion .
you know this desert ?
Yes , sergeant .
is it all like this ?
Yes , all that way worse for tank .
deep sand ?
and salt marshes . only one caravan trail . very old .
- Hard to follow . - Where does it lead ?
to the well at Hassan Barrani .
you think you could find it again ?
I think I can .
I will try .
get your pack off and get on top .
Jimmy , throw down a ration . the rest get back in place .
Waco , start her up . we &apos;re moving on right now .
look !
those birds know just when to show up .
they can smell death ahead of time .
anybody know what he &apos;s babbling ?
I speak English .
speak very good .
don &apos;t leave me here . take me with you .
sorry , we got no room .
I learn English in school in Torino .
and I learn Americano from reading the letters .
it &apos;s the cousin of the uncle of mia moglie .
that &apos;s my wife , signore .
she got an uncle whose cousin live in America and he write all the time .
he tell about the big mountain , the big building , the big art .
everything big in America !
Waco , wind her up . we &apos;re moving on .
I show you letter .
I got a letter from my wife .
she told me she get a letter from the cousin of the uncle .
he work now in Pittsburgh , USA .
in the steel factory .
maybe he make the steel for this tank in Pittsburgh , USA .
and , signore I show you picture .
I got no time to look at pictures .
he &apos;s right . it &apos;s stupid to have pity in war .
you kill in a fight . not like this .
I know better than you .
- I &apos;ve been fighting them since 1936 . - &apos; 36 ?
Spain .
there &apos;s no pity .
my wife and bambina .
that &apos;s my baby .
it &apos;s a nice picture . you must be very proud of them .
I &apos;ll see what I can do .
I wish you &apos;d change your mind .
this man is a prisoner of war .
as such , he &apos;s entitled to certain rights .
we &apos;ve got to take him . we can &apos;t leave him to die .
if we asked the men , they &apos;d agree .
they &apos;d agree now .
what about when they &apos;re starving and dying of thirst ?
you put me in command to look ahead .
- This is a matter of a man &apos;s life !
- You &apos;re wrong .
it &apos;s a matter of the lives of 10 men .
we got a long ways to go .
we need every crumb of food and drop of water .
I &apos;m taking the Sudanese because he &apos;s a British soldier .
but I won &apos;t take on a load of spaghetti !
he walked this far , and he can walk back .
that &apos;s the end of it .
what are you waiting for ?
wind her up .
okay , Joe .
you better get in , Doc .
I &apos;m sorry .
don &apos;t leave me here to die .
I swear , I work for you .
I don &apos;t drink your water I don &apos;t eat your food .
don &apos;t leave me here .
stop !
come on . come on !
hold your fire .
let the blighter have it . I could squash him like a fly .
no , let him think we &apos;re out of ammunition .
blasted him out of the sky !
you men all right down there ?
Yes , Bimbashi .
Tambul , follow me !
Doc , come along in case that guy don &apos;t speak English .
- I &apos;ll come with you , Tambul . - Here &apos;s your gun !
drop that gun !
you heard me , drop it !
what &apos;d he say ?
my German &apos;s a little rusty , but I think I got the sense of it .
he said we haven &apos;t got a chance .
he wants us to be his prisoners .
is he crazy ?
ask him if he speaks English .
he says no .
he didn &apos;t know Americans were here .
a surprise for you , Fritzie .
- We saved it for you , special . - Search him .
- What &apos;s eating him ?
- He wants someone else to do it .
he does , does he ?
why ?
he doesn &apos;t want to be touched by an inferior race .
tell him not to worry about his being black .
it won &apos;t come off on his uniform . search him .
a knife .
and this .
that &apos;s what I thought .
what do you make of that , Doc ?
it says an offer has been made to the British Army .
&quot; raise the white flag and give up your arms .
we have proved the British are led by incompetents and idiots . &quot;
- What &apos;s that ?
- The fall of Tobruk !
what &apos;s that about Tobruk ?
he &apos;s lying like his blasted Führer !
I &apos;ll teach him to lie !
signore Sergeante !
somebody is hurt .
the German , he shoot .
bring him along and pick up that chute .
bring some water .
- Where &apos;s Halliday ?
- What happened ?
take it easy , fella .
we didn &apos;t know he was lying there .
he &apos;s hurt so bad he couldn &apos;t speak .
get the first-aid kit , please .
move him into the shade . very gently .
take it easy .
that &apos;s it .
did you get him ?
don &apos;t try to talk now . we &apos;ll fix you up , all right .
how is he , Doc ?
he &apos;s badly shot but he may pull through .
we can &apos;t hang around here any longer .
- Is it safe to move him ?
- Yes , if we take it easy .
we got to move quickly , after what the German said .
maybe he &apos;s right .
Doyle , get on that radio .
Yes , sarge .
what will we do with this prisoner ?
there is no doubt we have too many in this tank .
here is another mouth that asks for water .
I don &apos;t mean we can leave him here in this desert to die .
my heart is very soft for this Nazi .
let me have a little talk with him .
I &apos;ll march him behind the hill there .
when you &apos;re ready to go , I &apos;ll come back alone .
Corporal , you got a lot to learn .
this is a Nazi .
maybe you find out . it &apos;s like a mad dog .
maybe . but he &apos;s won a lot of prizes .
I &apos;d like to turn him over to headquarters .
if we can get there ourselves !
we &apos;ll keep him as long as we can , then see .
in the meantime he &apos;s in your charge .
thank you .
did you get anything ?
- The Germans got Tobruk . - I know . anything else ?
they &apos;re attacking Sidi Barrani .
we &apos;re still falling back , trying to reform our lines .
what are you smiling at ?
you look like you understood every word he said .
Doc , ask him what he was smiling at .
he thinks it &apos;s funny we want to fight with this curious detachment .
wipe that smile off your puss or I &apos;ll knock your teeth through your head .
all right , boys , we move on .
every minute we &apos;re here , our chance of getting through is less .
he may be lying about Germans in the neighborhood , but we can &apos;t tell .
we &apos;ve got to go ahead as if it was the truth .
- Tambul !
- Yes , sergeant .
how far are those wells ?
about 60 to 70 miles .
it is there .
- How far ?
- What , sergeant ?
how far ?
there , ahead !
you will see as we go down this hill .
- How is he ?
- He &apos;s pretty bad , sir .
what &apos;s he saying ?
sounds like his girl &apos;s name , sir .
- Give him some water . - Can &apos;t , sir .
not a drop left .
bone dry .
it is so in the desert .
one season there is cool , clear water , like lakes in the mountains .
another time nothing .
just a lot of sand .
what &apos;s funny ?
just thinking .
when we were kids , the biggest treat was to play on the beach in the sand .
how far is it to the next well ?
about 50 miles , sergeant .
at the ruins of Bir Acroma .
it is south .
Hello , Kathy .
I miss--
Captain Halliday , sir . Captain Halliday !
he keeps talking to his girl , Kathy .
he &apos;s gone .
it &apos;s tough .
he did it !
let him alone , Stegman .
battle order of the Army .
do not retreat anotherinch .
Cairo and Alexandria must be defended .
the Army will stand and fight north ofEl Khattara on the El Alamein line .
scattered units are ordered to report to their commands immediately .
we need every man and every machine .
report to your commands .
Re-form yourlines .
report to your commands .
hurry .
that &apos;s it ahead , sergeant .
right !
left .
you hear that , Joe ?
she &apos;s missing , ain &apos;t she ?
I wonder how much longer she &apos;ll keep going .
so do I .
Clarkson , back there .
maybe he was lucky !
there , straight ahead !
Bir Acroma !
come on down , guys . everybody take cover inside .
come on , Jimmy . on your feet !
how is it , Jim ?
okay , Joe .
where &apos;s that well ?
somewhere near the building . inside the wall , sergeant .
all right , men . spread out and look for that well !
stick along with me .
sure took a beating , didn &apos;t you , old girl ?
Bimbashi !
the well !
the well !
around here .
you better go down and look .
send down a bucket . there &apos;s still water dripping !
- Something to catch it !
- It &apos;s going to waste .
bring up a couple of cans and rope from the tank .
heads up !
here it comes .
pull it up slowly .
careful !
what a beautiful sight .
real water .
easy now . don &apos;t spill a drop .
three swallows for everybody .
three swallows . no more .
here you are , Jimmy .
Stegman , take Frenchie &apos;s place .
three swallows .
Giuseppe !
- Three swallows . - Three swallows .
for the German .
everybody gets three swallows .
Yes , sergeant .
we &apos;re considering going to this other well .
but we must be sure that we &apos;ll find enough water there .
at Bir Acroma , there has been water in sufficient quantities .
but it means going 130 kilometers out of our way .
these men need water badly , HerrKapitän .
your machines may get through without more water but you take a serious risk with the men .
go with Sergeant Krause &apos;s advance party .
show them the way to Bir Acroma .
the battalion will follow in an hour .
we must get water .
how &apos;s it coming ?
very good , sergeant , very nice .
any way to squeeze it out quicker ?
it takes its own time . you cannot milk it like a cow .
we &apos;ll stay until we get all the water we can carry .
we got to , but it &apos;s tough to waste all that time .
Bates , stand by here . Waco , let &apos;s clean Lulubelle out .
the rest of you , go over your equipment .
Stegman , on lookout .
that water helped , didn &apos;t it ?
couldn &apos;t have lasted much longer .
keep a sharp lookout , especially toward those hills .
if trouble comes , it &apos;ll come from there .
watch for planes .
signore .
I would like to help you .
you know about motors ?
I was maestro mechanic in Torino .
you got a job .
Frenchie let the Italian come around here .
let me take your place .
no , it isn &apos;t necessary .
how is it coming ?
I &apos;m afraid it drops more slowly .
you never can tell about these wells .
have a cigarette .
thanks .
how long you been in the army ?
Twenty years .
my father and his father before him were soldiers .
all my family have been soldiers .
my folks were always farmers .
you know where Texas is ?
it must be very far .
Yes , sir . I &apos;m going back there when this is finished .
- I got married just before I left . - Good .
good ?
it &apos;s better than that .
but you fellas feel differently about marrying .
the boys were telling me you Mohammedans have as many as 300 wives .
the Prophet tells us four wives are sufficient for a true believer .
why four ?
the Prophet says one wife makes a miserable life because she gets bored .
and two wives make a mess of your life also .
for they always quarrel and you never know which one is right .
and three wives are bad too .
two always take sides against a third .
now , four wives makes real happiness .
how ?
two and two are company for each other .
and the man , he has his rest .
it sounds all right .
you got four ?
no , I have only one .
what &apos;s holding you back ?
if you had this law in your Texas , would you have four wives ?
no , my wife wouldn &apos;t like that .
it is the same with me . my wife , she would not like it .
you sure learn things in the army !
Yes , we both have much to learn from each other .
I understand . that guy Mussolini you got over there , he doesn &apos;t ?
ll Duce , he &apos;s a big man .
he speaks like a thunderstorm .
and you guys believe him ?
he tells me he knows best .
everywhere , he writes his mottos . on the walls , on the street ...
so we got him in the brain .
we must believe these mottos .
what does that mean ?
obey . believe . work .
obey ?
work for what ?
not so much now , Signore .
but Mussolini say , by and by , everything is going to be all right .
he says it &apos;s going to be all right .
he thinks he &apos;s God , don &apos;t he ?
Yeah , he think .
but I think maybe Hitler is God and Mussolini is just his prophet .
don &apos;t you worry . someday that guy will blow up and bust .
for some people , it &apos;s all right to laugh at il Duce .
but when you got a wife and baby , it &apos;s no good to laugh .
my little Giuseppina .
such a small bambina .
eyes , big like this .
she &apos;s beautiful .
everybody say she look just like me .
well , don &apos;t tell her .
no , I don &apos;t .
sure , I &apos;m going to tell her !
how do you spell oasis ?
O-A-S-I-S .
scientifically , this isn &apos;t an oasis .
my wife ain &apos;t scientific .
I &apos;m saying I &apos;m on green grass with palm trees waving overhead .
you know you can &apos;t post a letter here .
I promised her I &apos;d write home every week , if I wasn &apos;t dead .
well , I ain &apos;t dead .
I should write to my mother .
what part of South Africa do you come from ?
a dorp near Kimberley .
dorp ?
what &apos;s that ?
a village .
it &apos;s a fine country .
there &apos;s always a soft breeze blowing across the veldt .
sounds good . but personally , I think I &apos;ll stick to Brooklyn .
I was born in Sussex , but we moved to a little farm in Yorkshire .
I &apos;m from London .
I &apos;m from Dublin .
what part of the States are you from ?
no place .
just the Army .
in my village , we had the finest cheese .
- What kind of cheese ?
- From my village . Moulin-Merillac .
what it &apos;s like ?
a sort of Brie or Camembert ?
there &apos;s no village like mine .
there is no cheese like we make .
you should have such a meal !
you take a knife .
here , you have a little cheese , a little bread .
then you wash your throat with wine .
then a little cheese .
and a little onion .
good !
a little onion .
a little bread , a little wine .
a little cheese , a little bread .
a little wine , a little onion .
a little cheese , a little bread .
lay off !
you had enough .
I feel better . all this is no more .
six months ago I &apos;m in my village , but I don &apos;t know it .
there is no cheese !
how do you make cheese without milk ?
how do you make milk without cows ?
we had fine cows with the brown face and the white neck .
the Nazis take these cows . they cut the throat with a knife .
there is no more cheese and milk for the children .
you were in occupied France six months ago ?
- Why were you there ?
- He worked with the underground .
I learned from the channel .
I have seen 12 people executed .
Hostages .
the mayor , who has a white beard Madame Michelet was as big like a jelly Monsieur Le Pecq , who teaches the school Rosalie , who has hair like sunshine .
I can do nothing .
so I &apos;m no good for the underground . too much hate in my eyes !
so I come here .
I wish only to kill to pay back for my village !
there &apos;s something headed this way !
see the cloud of dust ?
moving fast .
German scout car .
keep your eye on them . keep down so they can &apos;t see you .
Leroux , get the Italian inside !
Bates , bring those canteens back to the tank .
the rest of you men take cover .
come on , get in .
you speak English ?
- Coming our way ?
- Straight for us .
all right , watch them .
- Where are they ?
- Behind that hill , coming right at us .
Waco and Jim , get behind that ridge .
hold your fire !
I want prisoners . the rest of you , keep down .
you understand what they say , don &apos;t you ?
you speak English . then you can speak with me .
shut up !
when the time comes , I will tell you what to do .
Sheik Ali , Hans , mirnach .
what happened ?
there was shooting , then there was nothing .
be quiet !
ask him what regiment .
ask him where their outfit is .
this ain &apos;t getting us nowhere .
Bates , bring me up some water .
tell them to take their hands down .
- What do you make of that ?
- Nothing .
all right , take him away .
ask him again what his outfit is .
ask him if he &apos;s thirsty .
tell him he can have water only if he talks .
they &apos;re lost , separated from their company .
tell him he &apos;s lying .
only if you talk .
keep asking him . we got to break him .
come on , talk !
they &apos;re an advance party of a battalion cutting southeast across the Egyptian border .
light , motorized units , no tanks , but about 500 men .
they &apos;ve had no water in days .
they &apos;re told they &apos;ll get all the water they want here .
here &apos;s your water .
go on , take it .
sergeant Gunn !
just as I expected , the well has gone dry .
how much have we got ?
nine and a quarter cans .
it don &apos;t matter , because we &apos;re leaving .
it &apos;ll be a good joke on the Jerries when they get here .
wouldn &apos;t have minded seeing their faces .
what &apos;d you say ?
I wouldn &apos;t mind seeing their faces when they get here .
that &apos;s right .
maybe we ought to see their faces .
any water within 100 miles ?
not from here , but the first well ?
- Anything in sight ?
- Nothing , sarge , not a thing .
Hey , Doc , Williams , Stegman !
I got a lot to say , and not much time to say it .
we found out those Germans are part of a battalion stuck back at the first well , badly in need of water .
think of a battalion so in need of water they got to come 70 miles off their line of march .
suppose they got held up long enough for us to send a message ?
how ?
suppose we send the two Germans to tell them there &apos;s water here .
suppose we hold them up for two or three days while they try to get it .
there &apos;s just one thing wrong with that plan . here we are .
here are the Germans and here &apos;s what happens .
you hit it right on the nose . it &apos;s 100-to-1 shot .
we could clear out of here quick .
with some luck , get through German lines and back to ours .
if we did get back there , they might even give us a medal .
if we stay here maybe nobody will ever know what happened here .
or if it is worthwhile or if it is all wasted .
I realize it &apos;s not common sense , 9 men fighting off 500 .
still , it &apos;s the duty of every man in the Army to do everything he can .
excuse me , sir .
nine of us with peashooters doesn &apos;t make any sense .
if it &apos;s our duty to delay this column , why all the talk ?
just give us our orders .
that brings us down to cases . I look at it this way .
because it &apos;s 100-to-1 shot because it &apos;s much more than line of duty because there &apos;s so little chance of us coming out of it I felt I ought to put up to you .
you &apos;ve all got families at home . wives , mothers and sweethearts .
I ain &apos;t got none , so it doesn &apos;t matter about me .
I know how you feel about them .
whatever you decide , you better decide quick .
I &apos;ll speak for Waco and Jimmy myself .
nobody minds giving his life , but this is throwing it away . why ?
why did your people go about their business in London when the Germans threw everything at them ?
why did your boats take the men off the beach at Dunkirk ?
why did the Russians make a stand at Moscow ?
why did the Chinese move whole cities thousands of miles inland when the Japs attacked them ?
why Bataan ?
why Corregidor ?
maybe they were all nuts .
but there &apos;s one thing they did do :
they kept delaying the enemy until we got strong enough to hit them hard .
I ain &apos;t no general but it seems to me that &apos;s one way to win .
if all I said don &apos;t answer your question then somebody tell me why .
I &apos;m for staying .
- I &apos;ll stay . - Me too , sarge .
it may surprise you , professor , to know that you &apos;re the one man I was absolutely counting on .
mind you , it &apos;s against my better judgement .
then I know I &apos;m right .
what about you , Frenchie ?
I still like your cigarettes .
all right , on your feet .
stand up .
Hey , Doc !
tell him we &apos;re sending him back .
the other fellow told us the truth .
tell him we &apos;re lost too . we need food , they need water .
it &apos;s a fair exchange . no use fighting about it .
water for food .
shut that man up !
he knows English . he tried to warn them .
you &apos;re playing a game ?
you can call it that .
if he moves again , shoot him .
I shall be happy to , sergeant .
you know he talked English ?
I just found out .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
I was afraid .
I &apos;m like a man who fights his shadow .
you give me water , I eat your food .
I swear I will do nothing wrong .
I give you my parola . that &apos;s my word .
we got to work fast .
I want that tank dug in , and slip trenches .
that &apos;s William , Stegman and Bates . take the Italian along to help out .
all right , Doc , go ahead .
Waco , start them on their way and then bring up the half-track .
go on , beat it !
- How is it coming ?
- She &apos;s almost full .
- How many you got left ?
- A little over five canteens .
and this is for you on the road .
take it , Waco .
okay , Tambul .
got it filled ?
pretty sure of yourself .
I like to travel . it broadens the mind .
I wish you wasn &apos;t so cocky about it .
you think I can &apos;t make it ?
I ain &apos;t saying .
I &apos;ll take a bet on it .
- Even money ?
- Why not ?
I got an even chance of getting there . I &apos;m eating British mess tomorrow .
here &apos;s five says you won &apos;t .
here &apos;s ten says I will .
that &apos;s a sucker bet .
if I lose , I won &apos;t need the ten .
all right , Waco . Joe will hold the money .
okay , Waco , get going !
you got to make it .
tell them we need help if they can send it .
don &apos;t worry , I can make it .
I can make this thing stand up and howl .
so long , fellas . I got to mail a letter .
now right .
turn it more to the right .
now straight ahead .
it &apos;s a good thing the Jerries had mines in this scout car .
they &apos;re coming over the hills .
that &apos;s right .
here are your belts .
cover yourself , Frenchie , and watch that German .
around that corner , back of the wall .
- Everything all set here ?
- All set , Joe .
hold your fire till they get to the top of that ridge !
- Hey , Doc !
- Right !
Jimmy !
- Bates !
- I &apos;m here !
all right , Frenchie ?
- Tambul !
- Fine , sergeant .
Stegman !
I think I saw something white out there .
sarge , they &apos;re showing a white flag !
we said we &apos;d make a deal with them .
it looks like our trick is working .
I &apos;ll see what they want . they can do the translating themselves .
watch yourself . you can &apos;t tell with these blighters .
don &apos;t trust them , Joe . it &apos;s a trick .
I &apos;ll be all right . you just stay there and keep me covered .
Major Hans Von Falken .
Gunn , United States Army .
you have come a long way to pull British chestnuts out of the fire .
we don &apos;t mind . we like chestnuts . don &apos;t want them to burn .
very good .
you didn &apos;t come to crack jokes . what do you want ?
can you negotiate ?
where &apos;s your captain ?
it &apos;s around 5 : 00 . you know how those Britishers are about their tea .
I understand you propose to give us water in exchange for food .
we thought you only had about 30 men .
you knew there was a battalion .
the soldier who gave the information confessed .
he &apos;s been executed .
isn &apos;t it still possible to come to an agreement ?
what &apos;s the deal ?
surrender , and you &apos;ll be free to go with as much water and food as you can carry .
we like it here . we &apos;re pretty well fixed .
plenty of water and a lot more food than we thought we had .
I &apos;ll make you an offer .
water for guns .
for every rifle , I &apos;ll give you a pint . for the mortar , a quart .
for all your rifles , I &apos;ll give you water enough for all your men .
I &apos;ve heard you Americans have a great sense of humor .
I &apos;ll give you a last chance .
you can save your life , and the lives of your men .
you heard my offer . water for guns .
how &apos;d you make out ?
- He spoke English pretty good . - What &apos;d he say ?
they think we got so much water we &apos;re swimming in it .
they &apos;re worse off than we thought they were .
they &apos;ll let us go if we give them water .
do you think Waco &apos;s reached a British outpost yet ?
- It &apos;s possible . - Maybe they &apos;re on the way .
I can see them crowding around , clapping him on the back giving him glasses of ice cold water .
they &apos;re getting anxious .
just got two of them .
good , but take it easy , will you ?
if we keep on , we &apos;ll be on our last belt by tomorrow .
isn &apos;t it enough to get two ?
got to get 10 with every shot before I &apos;m satisfied .
here &apos;s your water .
time to strike the rock .
what &apos;s that about a rock ?
the other day , I was making fun of you .
I said you &apos;ll perform a miracle .
strike a rock and water will run out or maybe champagne .
the only miracle I know is the one you get by working for it .
I wish a miracle would cure my corn .
why ?
gives you something to think about .
I &apos;ve got plenty to think about .
I &apos;ve just been working on a problem .
what kind of a problem ?
you might call it a project .
a project ?
I &apos;m planning on how to irrigate this desert .
what , all of it ?
why not ?
turn it into a blooming garden .
ain &apos;t a bad idea .
there &apos;s plenty of water , only it &apos;s not in the right places .
it just stands about , waiting for people to drown in it .
you feeling all right ?
as I remember , you can irrigate one acre with about 15,000 cubic feet of water .
you &apos;re nuts .
- Where &apos;d you learn all that ?
- I &apos;m a typesetter by profession .
you learn by reading while you &apos;re setting type ?
nothing like it for an education .
I &apos;ve set type for about 5000 books .
Prose and poetry .
you wouldn &apos;t believe it , but I &apos;m very partial to poetry .
a book of verses underneath a bough , a jug of wine and ...
it was 100-to-1 shot , Williams .
now is the time !
we must reach the German camp to tell them there is no water here .
no , I cannot do this .
we have only to overpower one man .
maybe we can take the machine gun and kill them all !
I do not want to . I got no hate for these men .
it is not for you to decide .
I &apos;m not going .
this place will soon be taken .
if you refuse to help me now , I will denounce you as a traitor .
denounce me then .
Italians are not like Germans .
only the body wears the uniform , not the soul .
Mussolini is not so clever , like Hitler .
he dresses Italians up only to look like thieves , cheats , murderers .
he cannot , like Hitler , make them feel like that .
he cannot , like Hitler , scrape from their conscience the knowledge of right and wrong or plant in their heads his own Ten Commandments .
&quot; steal from thy neighbor . cheat and kill thy neighbor . &quot;
you dare to insult the Führer ?
that would take an artist . I am but a mechanic .
but are my eyes blind that I must fall to my knees to worship a maniac who has made of my country a concentration camp ?
who has made of my people , slaves ?
must I kiss the hand that beats me , lick the boot that kicks me ?
no !
I &apos;d rather spend my whole life living in this dirty hole than escape to fight again for things I do not believe against people I do not hate .
and for your Hitler it &apos;s because of a man like him that God my God , created hell .
German escaped .
tell them , no water .
I lost him .
I &apos;ll get him , sergeant .
there he comes .
he hasn &apos;t got a chance .
dirty !
he got the Heinie .
Bates , this is for you .
how are you , Leroux ?
how are you feeling ?
fit as a fiddle .
the sergeant say this is to last through next week .
sergeant likes his little joke .
in all the world , there &apos;s nothing--
free French Corporal Leroux , parlementaire .
Major Von Falken .
I was the only one he could send . the others are bathing .
be careful , it &apos;s all we &apos;ve got .
I &apos;d give plenty to see the expression on that Heinie &apos;s puss .
very impressive .
and the rest ?
all dead ?
we &apos;ll make no further attempt to take the well , if we get water .
this is my last offer . report it to your commander .
you are very generous .
but my sergeant did not say we &apos;d like to hear your terms .
he said maybe you would like to hear his terms once again .
for every rifle you send , he will send a pint of water .
one rifle , one pint .
two rifles , two pints . three rifles--
enough of this nonsense !
if you don &apos;t like these terms and you still want the water then you must come and get it .
fire !
Frenchie was right .
we don &apos;t know the Nazis . they did shoot him in the back .
come on in , Doc . sorry I can &apos;t give you a tall one .
- How &apos;s Jimmy doing ?
- Running low on ammunition .
- If we run out , what &apos;ll we fight with ?
- Bayonets , gun butts , fists .
how long can four of us keep on that way ?
I don &apos;t know , Doc .
I have to admit , it sounds impossible but we got to do it .
somebody will have to work a miracle .
a miracle ?
what kind of a miracle ?
you got me there , Doc .
four of us holding off several hundred of them is nothing short of a miracle .
you know why we &apos;re able to do it ?
because we &apos;re stronger than they are .
what do you mean ?
I don &apos;t mean in numbers .
I mean something else .
those men out there have never known the dignity of freedom .
dignity ?
that &apos;s a funny way to put it .
maybe you got something there .
we &apos;ve all got something .
Joe , I &apos;m hit !
- Can you make it inside , Jim ?
- I &apos;ll try .
you &apos;ve got to . come on .
up !
get down !
you &apos;ll be all right .
it &apos;s going to take a lot more than this to kill me .
that &apos;s the spirit . never say die .
water !
got to make it .
somebody &apos;s lying there .
is he dead ?
he &apos;s an American .
that was a close one .
they got the well .
bull &apos;s-eye in the well .
what &apos;s the difference ?
no difference .
as the saying goes , &quot; It was fun while it lasted . &quot;
I wonder what it feels like .
- What ?
- Cold steel .
they tell me it &apos;s over pretty quick .
I never did tell you what my first name was .
no , what is it ?
Osmond .
right , it &apos;s a funny name .
that &apos;s okay .
hope somebody finds this .
finds what ?
- My tag . - Why ?
if they don &apos;t find it , I &apos;m missing .
if they do find it , I &apos;m dead .
if I &apos;m missing , nobody will know I &apos;m dead .
if I &apos;m dead , nobody will know I &apos;m missing .
I might as well be dead .
here they come .
it looks like they &apos;re all coming this time .
okay , Osmond , this is it .
why don &apos;t they finish it ?
come on and take us !
we &apos;re waiting for you .
come on and get it over with !
come on , we ain &apos;t surrendering !
water .
you &apos;re giving guns for water .
go ahead , there it is !
drink all you can find .
go on , take it !
there it is !
roll in it , swim in it !
drink till it rolls out of your ears . go ahead !
drink till it splits your guts .
it &apos;s full of water .
the shells opened up the well .
it &apos;s a blooming miracle .
that &apos;s just what it is .
get down there and take their guns away .
let them drink , then line them up .
I &apos;ll cover you from here .
it &apos;s an American tank .
with some German prisoners .
send some men to pick them up .
it &apos;s them !
they &apos;re coming to meet us . she made it !
Hi , sarge . it &apos;s good to see you .
how &apos;s Lulubelle ?
Hello , boys !
tell us about it .
we had a crummy old time of it .
- Hi , Waco . - Hi , Joe .
you got a butt ?
Crummy-looking bunch you got here . how &apos;d you get them ?
they just walked in .
I see you whittled them down a bit .
they whittled us down too .
Jimmy ?
how was it ?
pretty rough ?
pretty rough .
I &apos;ve been out of this war for a few days . what &apos;s going on ?
the limeys held the Jerries at El Alamein .
too bad they didn &apos;t know about it .
they &apos;d want to know .
Halliday .
Doyle .
Tambul .
Williams .
Stegman .
Frenchie .
Clarkson .
we stopped them at El Alamein .
come in .
Mr Spencer .
Mr Spencer , I hate to bother you ... but I thought you &apos;d like to know there were two men here .
two men asking &apos; for you .
a young man and a kind of older man .
they was sorry you wasn &apos;t in . I said you wasn &apos;t .
- Did they say they &apos;d be back ?
- They didn &apos;t say , but I think they will .
just now , when I had to go to the store , I seen them standing there at the corner .
maybe I shoulda let them in , only you said not to disturb you -
- Yes .
- And I &apos;m sure They &apos;ll be back .
you look kinda tired to me , and that &apos;s a fact .
you got a headache or somethin &apos; ?
I think maybe you need a real rest . that &apos;s what I think .
why , Mr Spencer . you oughtn &apos;t to leave all that money lying around like that .
Oh , it makes me nervous to see money lying around .
everybody in the world ain &apos;t honest , you know .
though I must say I haven &apos;t had much trouble that way .
those friends of yours told me not to mention they &apos;d called .
wanted to surprise you . but I thought you &apos;d like to know somehow . Yes , yes .
of course . if they come back , you may show them in . Yes .
you know , Mrs Martin , it &apos;s very funny .
they aren &apos;t exactly friends of mine . they &apos;ve never seen me .
- That &apos;s odd , isn &apos;t it ?
- &apos; Tis odd , like you say .
and now that I &apos;m here , I &apos;ll have to meet them .
I may even go out and meet them .
and then again , I may not . not yet .
you go ahead with your nap . I &apos;ll pull down the blind .
what do you know ? you &apos;re bluffing . you &apos;ve nothing on me .
Hello , Postal Union ?

love to you all ... and a kiss for little Charlie from her Uncle Charlie .
that &apos;s right . that &apos;s the signature . &quot; Uncle Charlie . &quot;
that &apos;s right . Santa Rosa .
Santa Rosa , California .
Ann ! answer the telephone .
Newton &apos;s residence . Ann Newton speaking .
Oh , hello , Mrs Henderson . this is Ann .
mother isn &apos;t home yet .
a telegram ? well ...
I don &apos;t see a pencil , so maybe she better call you back .
I &apos;m trying to keep my mind free of things that don &apos;t matter ... because I have so much to keep on my mind .
Innumerable things .
I &apos;ll have her call back . thank you for calling .
Goodbye .
Hello , Ann . where &apos;s your mother ?
- She &apos; s out .
- Out ? Mrs Henderson just called from the Postal Union Office .
she says we have a telegram .
I would have taken it down , only I couldn &apos;t find a pencil .
I looked . telegram , eh ?
I knew there &apos;d be trouble if your Aunt Sarah got her driver &apos;s licence .
- Whereabouts was the accident ?
- I didn &apos;t take notes .
Oh . then how about a kiss ?
isn &apos;t that the funniest thing ?
here I am , practically a child and I wouldn &apos;t read the things you read .
Mm-hm . well , I guess they &apos;d give you bad dreams .
bad dreams ? you don &apos;t understand , Papa . mystery stories have done -
- Where &apos;s Roger ?
- Out . the average mind -
- Where &apos;s Charlie ?
- Out . no , she &apos;s in her room thinking .
well , don &apos;t read too much . you &apos;ll ruin your eyes .
and leave my book alone . what &apos;s that you &apos;re reading ?
- Ivanhoe .
- Hm ?
- Who is it ?
- It &apos;s me .
what &apos;s the matter ? don &apos;t you feel well ?
no . I &apos;m perfectly well .
I &apos;ve just been thinking for hours , and I &apos;ve come to the conclusion I give up .
- I simply give up .
- What are you going to give up ?
have you ever to thought that a family should be the most wonderful thing ever ?
and that this family &apos;s just gone to pieces ?
- We have ?
- Of course we have .
we just sort of go along and nothing happens . we &apos;re in a terrible rut .
it &apos;s been on my mind for months . what &apos;s going to be our future ?
Oh , come now , Charlie . things aren &apos;t as bad as that .
- The bank gave me a raise last January .
- Money .
how can you talk about money when I &apos;m talking about souls ?
we eat and sleep and that &apos;s about all .
we don &apos;t even have any real conversations .
- We just talk . - And work .
Yes . poor Mother . she works like a dog .
- Just like a dog .
- Where is she ?
she &apos;s out . when she comes back , it &apos;ll be the same thing .
dinner , then dishes , then bed . I don &apos;t see how she stands it .
you know , she &apos;s really a wonderful woman .
I mean , she &apos;s not just a mother .
and I think we ought to do something for her .
- Don &apos; t you think we should ?
- Yeah . what were you thinking of ?
Oh , nothing , I suppose .
I guess we &apos;ll just have to wait for a miracle or something .
Oh , now , Charlie , you &apos;re right . absolutely right .
- I &apos;ll figure out some way -
- I don &apos;t believe in good intentions now .
- All I &apos;m waiting for now is a miracle .
- Oh , Charlie .
those back stairs are steep .
what &apos;s the matter , Charlie ? what &apos;s the matter , Joe ?
- Well , it seems that , uh -
- Oh , I &apos;ve become a nagging old maid .
you went downtown in that awful old hat you &apos;d promised you &apos;d throw away .
- Mama .
- Darling , does it matter what hat I wear ?
- Mama .
- Why do you let that child yell at you ?
- If she -
- I &apos;m going downstairs , anyway .
Joe , what were you both talking about when I came in ?
something about a miracle .
Oh , it &apos;s nothing . Charlie &apos; s a bit under the weather .
Oh . well , she &apos; II be all right .
well , come on , dear . let &apos;s go downstairs . no use standing here .
I &apos;m going to get myself a bottle of beer .
mother , I &apos;m going downtown and send a telegram .
why , darling , who do you know to send a telegram to ?
I know a wonderful person who &apos;ll come and stir us up . just the one to save us .
what do you mean , &quot; save us &quot; ?
all this time , there &apos;s been one right person to save us .
- What &apos;s Uncle Charlie &apos;s address ?
- Uncle Charlie ?
- You &apos;re not going to ask him for money ?
- Of course not . that wouldn &apos;t help us . what &apos;s his address ?
- The last address I had -
- Do you know how many steps it is to get from here to the drugstore and back ?
- 649 . - If you &apos;ve forgotten , I won &apos;t tell you .
- I remember . Philadelphia .
you can &apos;t ask a busy man to come all this way for nothing .
he &apos;ll come for me . I &apos;m named after him .
besides , we &apos;re the only relatives he has in the world .
if you come all the way up Fourth Street , it &apos;s 802 .
- Mama , guess what ?
- I have no time for guessing .
what &apos;s that thing in your hair ?
well , I &apos;ll tell you anyway , even though I think it &apos;s nicer when people guess .
Mrs Henderson said to call her at the telegraph office .
we have a telegram .
Ann , I don &apos;t think you ought to put things behind your ears .
- Something might get into your ear .
- Emmy , Ann says we have a telegram .
I think you ought to find out about it .
somebody might be sick or something .
Mrs Henderson didn &apos;t read the telegram because I couldn &apos;t find a pencil .
when I have a house , it &apos;s going to be full of well-sharpened pencils .
- Did Mrs Henderson say who it &apos;s from ?
- No , she didn &apos;t .
she might have said who it was from .
come on , Ann . that &apos;s my chair .
I &apos;ll call up and find out .
if you will be quiet just a second .
Hello . 181 , please . I wonder who it can be ?
Oh , nothing , Operator . just 181 .
- If that &apos;s from my sister -
- Hello ?
Mrs Henderson ? this is Emma Newton .
Ann says you have a telegram for me .
- Mama , you don &apos;t have to shout .
- Ssh . really , Papa . you &apos;d think Mama had never seen a phone .
she makes no allowance for science .
she thinks she has to cover the distance by sheer lungpower .
why , how wonderful . Thursday , you say ?
looks like somebody &apos;s coming .
- Who &apos;s coming , Ma ?
- Well , it &apos;s the most wonderful surprise .
it &apos;s my brother , you know . my younger brother . the baby .
Yes , of course , a little spoiled . families always spoil the youngest .
well , it &apos;s just simply wonderful .
thanks most awfully , Mrs Henderson .
well ...
what do you think ? Charles is coming .
- Who ?
- Your Uncle Charlie .
did you say &quot; Charles &quot; ?
and our Charlie &apos;s sending him a telegram .
now , what made her think to do that ?
Hello , Charlie . I just called your house .
- Telegram for your mother .
- Did you ? gonna send that by Bill Forest , but you can take it .
thanks .
from your uncle . the spoiled one .
my uncle ? my Uncle Charlie ?
Yeah .
Mrs Henderson , do you believe in telepathy ?
well , I ought to . that &apos;s my business .
Oh , not telegraphy . mental telepathy .
like ...
well , suppose you have a thought , and suppose the thought &apos;s about someone you &apos;re in tune with .
then across miles , that person knows what you &apos;re thinking and answers you .
- And it &apos;s all mental .
- I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
I only send telegrams the normal way .
he heard me . he heard me .
- Mr Otis ?
Mr Otis ? - Yes ?
you &apos;re almost in Santa Rosa . want to be ready when you get into Santa Rosa .
- I &apos;m ready now . thanks .
- Then I &apos;ll get all your bags out for you .
- How you feelin &apos; , Mr Otis ?
- Pretty well .
a little weak but pretty well on the whole .
Mm-hm .
Harry , tell the porter you &apos;re a doctor .
ask if there &apos;s anything you can do . maybe you can help that poor soul .
- I &apos;m on my vacation .
- My husband &apos;s a doctor and if there &apos;s -
no , Ma &apos;am . he &apos;s a very sick man . won &apos;t see anyone .
I haven &apos;t set eyes on him myself since we first got on the train .
well , you don &apos; t look very well either .
Ah , here we are . come on , children .
close the door , there . that &apos;s right .
- Oh , are you - - Charlie .
young Charlie .
at first , I didn &apos;t know you . I thought you were sick .
- Sick ?
- You aren &apos;t sick , are you ?
look , Pop ! here he is !
why , Uncle Charlie , you &apos;re not sick . that was the funniest thing .
- Me , sick ? well , Joe , how are you ?
- Alright , Charles .
Roger . Hello , Ann . I bet you don &apos;t remember me .
I remember you sort of . you look different .
well , we better get started . Emma &apos;s got the dinner almost ready .
I couldn &apos;t persuade her to come to the station . dinner came first .
- Roger , get the bags . I &apos;ll take that .
- Thank you , Joe .
that &apos;s it . come on . let &apos;s go .
come on , Roger , get these bags .
you , uh , sure that isn &apos;t too heavy for you ?
Oh , no . it &apos;s nothing . I love to carry .
Emma . don &apos;t move .
standing there , you don &apos;t look like Emma Newton .
you look like Emma Spencer Oakley of 46 Burnham Street , St Paul , Minnesota .
- The prettiest girl on the block .
- Charles .
mama , nobody got off the train but Uncle Charlie .
- Let me look at you .
- There was only us meeting somebody .
- To think you could take the time off . - There was only one bed made up .
- It &apos;s so wonderful to have you here .
- Emmy , Emmy , don &apos;t cry .
and imagine your thinking of 46 Burnham Street .
I haven &apos;t thought of that funny old street in years .
I keep remembering those things .
all the old things .
Emmy , how &apos;s he look ? same old Charles , eh ?
Roger , Ann , get these other bags .
you have Charlie &apos;s room right here at the head of the stairs .
Emmy wanted to move Ann , but Charlie thought you &apos;d be more comfortable here .
come on , Roger .
- Ah-ah ! don &apos;t put the hat on the bed .
- Superstitious , Joe ?
no , but I don &apos;t believe in inviting trouble .
it wasn &apos;t the biggest yacht in the world , but it had a fireplace in the library and the bar was panelled in bleached mahogany .
you pushed a button and ...
what am I talking about ? that &apos;s all over .
let &apos;s talk about you .
Charlie , that &apos;s the prettiest dress I ever saw .
I think so , too .
why , Charles , don &apos;t you remember ?
remember ? remember what ?
- Why , Uncle Charlie , you sent it to me .
- I did ? well , say , I &apos;ve been sitting here all this time forgetting something .
Ann . Roger .
- Look at that .
Oh , dear now . - Joe . don &apos;t know whether you had one .
you didn &apos;t have to think of me , Charles .
presents for the children are alright .
say ...
I &apos;ve never had a wristwatch .
fellows at the bank &apos;ll think I &apos;m quite a sport .
I have two for you , Emmy . one old and one new .
Oh , Charles . what is it ?
- You shouldn &apos;t have . really . no .
Oh , Charles .
Oh , how ... beautiful .
Oh , I &apos;ve-I &apos;ve always wanted one .
Oh , Mother , it &apos;s exactly right . it &apos;s what you should have .
look , Emmy .
Charles . you &apos;ve had these all along .
Mm-hm . all along , Emmy . all these years .
safe in a deposit box , no matter where I was .
Oh . Grandpa and Grandma ?
1888 .
53 years ago .
aren &apos;t they sweet ?
my , she was pretty .
everybody was sweet and pretty then . the whole world .
a wonderful world . not like the world today .
not like the world now .
it was great to be young then .
we &apos;re all happy now , Uncle Charlie . look at us .
- And we &apos;re all happy at the same time .
- Now , for your present , Charlie .
Oh , I don &apos;t want anything . right now , I have enough .
before you came , I didn &apos;t think I had anything , but now I don &apos;t want another thing .
- She &apos;s crazy .
- She doesn &apos;t mean it .
if you ask me , I think she &apos;s putting on , like girls in books .
the ones that say they don &apos;t want anything always get more in the end .
- That &apos;s what she &apos;s hoping .
- She &apos;s not crazy .
the smartest girl in her class at school .
won the debate against theEast Richmond HighSchool .
she &apos; s got brains .
I meant it . please don &apos;t give me anything .
- Nothing ?
- Oh , I can &apos;t explain it .
but you came here and Mother &apos;s so happy and ...
Oh , I &apos;m glad that she named me after you and that she thinks we &apos;re both alike .
I think we are , too . I know it .
Oh , it would spoil things if you should give me anything .
you &apos;re a strange girl , Charlie . why would it spoil things ?
because we &apos;re not just an uncle and a niece . it &apos;s something else .
I know you . I know that you don &apos;t tell people a lot of things .
I don &apos;t either . I have a feeling that inside you somewhere , there &apos;s something nobody knows about .
something ... nobody knows ?
something secret and wonderful and ... I &apos;ll find it out .
it &apos;s not good to find out too much , Charlie .
but we &apos;re sort of like twins . don &apos;t you see ?
- We have to know .
- Give me your hand , Charlie .
thank you .
- You didn &apos;t even look at it .
- I don &apos;t have to .
no matter what you gave me , it &apos;d be the same .
here . let me show you .
it &apos;s a good emerald . a really good one .
good emeralds are the most beautiful things in the world .
- You &apos;ve had something engraved .
- I haven &apos;t , but I will if you like it .
Yes , you have , Uncle Charlie . it &apos;s very faint .
&quot; T.S. From B.M. &quot;
but ... Why , it must be someone &apos;s initials .
well , I &apos;ve been rooked . the jeweller rooked me .
- Oh , it doesn &apos;t matter .
really . - Give it back . I &apos;ll have it taken off .
no , No . I like it this way .
someone else was probably happy with this ring .
Oh , it &apos;s perfect the way it is .
you bring the coffee .
sing at the table , you &apos;ll marry a crazy husband .
Superstitions have been proved 100 % wrong .
Yes , I &apos;ve been thinking of transferring some money out here from the East .
I could put it in your bank , Joe , until I found out what &apos;s what .
uh , I suppose your bank does take money , huh ?
that &apos;s one thing we do . Rake in the dough .
can &apos;t promise to give it back .
well , I &apos;ll go downtown in the morning and open an account .
- 30 or 40,000 just to start things off ?
- That &apos;s a lot of money .
he won &apos;t have it long . the government will get it .
- The government gets -
- Don &apos;t talk against the government .
the way men do things .
I can &apos;t get that tune out of my head .
maybe if somebody tells me what it is , I &apos;ll forget it .
- It &apos;s a waltz .
- I know it is , but what one ?
you know , it &apos;s the funniest thing .
sometimes I get a tune in my head like that and pretty soon , I hear somebody else humming it too .
I think tunes jump from head to head .
do you know whatit is , Uncle Charlie ?
uh , no . no . I-I-I don &apos;t know what it is .
I remember . uh ... It &apos;s on the tip of my tongue .
it &apos;s a waltz and it &apos;s Victor Herbert .
- Victor Herbert wasn &apos;t a waltz .
- It &apos;s the Blue Danube Waltz .
Oh , yes . of course it is .
no , it isn &apos;t , Uncle Charlie . I know what it is . it &apos;s the Merry -
- I &apos;m terribly sorry , Emmy . - Nothing to make a fuss about .
Charles , while we do the dishes , why don &apos;t you come in the living room and stretch out on the sofa and read the evening paper ?
you never were much on helping .
- Joe , here &apos;s Herbert .
- Ann , Roger , help me here .
Herbert &apos;s a friend of Joe &apos;s . they &apos;re literary critics .
Hello , Herb . had your supper ?
- Had mine an hour ago .
- Hour ago , huh ?
- Oh . a watch .
- Yeah , a present .
here , Herb . I &apos;d like you to meet my brother-in-law .
- Charles , this is Herb Hawkins .
- Nice to know you , Mr Hawkins .
- Fine , thank you .
- How &apos;s your mother , Herb ?
- Oh , uh , just middling . - Uh-huh .
- Excuse me , Herb . - Oh .
thank you .
I &apos;m sorry your mother &apos;s not better .
- Thank you , dear .
there , now . - Thank you .
lead a life of luxury .
well , I must go and see what Charlie &apos; s doing .
wife &apos;s brother from the East . new York man .
good for the children . you know what I mean ?
in business ? well , he takes himself very seriously .
well , how &apos;s everything ?
say , ha-have you read this one ? huh ?
that little Frenchman beats them all .
you can talk all you like about Sherlock Holmes .
that little Frenchman beats &apos; em all .
I read it . air bubbles don &apos;t necessarily kill a person .
those writers from the other side get too fancy .
- The best way to commit a murder-
- I know , I know .
hit &apos; em on the head with a blunt instrument .
well , it &apos;s true , isn &apos;t it ? listen .
if I wanted to murder you tomorrow , do you think I &apos;d waste my time on fancy hypodermics ?
- Or on Inee ?
- What &apos;s that ?
- Inee . Indian arrow poison . - Oh .
listen , I &apos;d find out if you were alone , walk in , hit you on the head with a piece of lead pipe or a loaded cane -
what &apos;d be the fun of that ?
where &apos;s your planning ? where &apos;s your clues ?
I don &apos;t want any clues . I want to murder you .
what do I want with clues ?
well , if you haven &apos;t got any clues , where &apos;s your book ?
I &apos;m not talkin &apos; &apos; bout writing books . I &apos;m talking about killing you !
if I was going to kill you , I wouldn &apos;t do a dumb thing like hitting you on the head .
first of all , I don &apos;t like the fingerprint angle .
of course , I could always wear gloves , press your hands against the pipe after you were dead and make you look like a suicide .
but you wouldn &apos;t beat yourself to death .
I &apos;d do it so it didn &apos;t look like murder .
Oh , Ann ?
- What ?
- Come here .
did you ever see a house made out of newspapers ?
well , watch .
You-You take one sheet here .
ok ? and you tear it down here .
and you tear it there .
you fold it over here at the side .
fold over the other side here .
and turn it up there .
now with ... the door ...
right off ... and there .
I &apos;m not a baby any more . besides , that &apos;s Papa &apos;s paper .
Oh , Roger , look what we &apos; ve got . a nice , little red barn .
- You &apos;ve got Papa &apos;s paper .
- Oh , that &apos;s alright .
simply unfold it . nobody will ever know the difference .
what are you two doing ?
- You know that &apos;s father &apos;s paper .
- It &apos;s my fault . I was playing a game .
- Didn &apos;t think about it as Joe &apos;s pap .
- Oh , that &apos;s alright .
here &apos;s page one , five ... eight .
- What did you do with three and four ?
- We never touched it .
really . Uncle Charlie &apos; s the only one that touched it .
Oh , well . I guess it &apos;s all right .
if I fold it very neatly , maybe he won &apos; t notice .
come in .
I brought you water .
Oh , thank you , Charlie . that &apos;s very thoughtful of you .
pleasant dreams .
Uncle Charlie ...
- I know a secret you don &apos;t think I know .
- What secret ?
remember I said you couldn &apos;t hide anything from me because I &apos;d find it out ?
well , now I know there was something in the evening paper about you .
about me in the evening paper ?
and that &apos;s why you played that game with Ann and Roger .
you didn &apos;t want us to know and you wanted to tear the paper .
now I know . you might as well tell me .
well , you &apos;ve got me there , Charlie .
it was about , uh ... someone I used to know .
there !
it &apos;s none of your business .
Oh ! Uncle Charlie , you &apos;re hurting me .
- Oh , Charlie . - Your hands .
Charlie , I didn &apos;t mean to hurt you .
I was just fooling .
it was nothing . just ...
just some gossip .
not very pretty , about someone I once met up with .
not for you to read .
forget it .
- Good night , young Charlie .
- Good night . pleasant dreams .
- How long is Uncle Charlie staying ?
- Forever , I hope .
hasn &apos;t he got a house of his own ?
not that I mind you in here , but I never can tell when I &apos;ll want some privacy .
you better go to sleep , baby .
- You said your prayers ?
you better say them .
I lay me down to sleep , I pray the Lord my soul to keep -
- Don &apos;t bless too many people . it &apos;s late .
- I pray the Lord my soul to take .
God bless Mama , Papa , Captain Midnight , Veronica Lake and the president -
- You can &apos;t say them all tonight , dear .
- Oh , and Uncle Charlie . amen .
- All ready for breakfast ?
- Oh , coffee , Emmy .
I don &apos;t know how you do it . now , I &apos;m never comfortable eating in bed .
I had to have my meals in bed for a while after the children came , but I never liked it .
I can &apos;t face the world in the morning .
I must have coffee before I can speak .
well , I don &apos;t mind pampering you your first morning , but I think you &apos;re the only person in this town to have breakfast at 10 : 30 .
and while you were sleeping , the newspaper called up for an interview .
with me ?
and the women &apos;s club I belong to wants you to give a little talk .
women &apos;s club .
Oh ! Oh , you haven &apos;t finished unpacking . I &apos;ll do that for you .
- Where &apos; s Charlie ?
- She &apos;s running around like a mad thing .
she thinks everything needs fixing .
but what I wanted to tell you was that you &apos;re not the only celebrity in this town .
- We &apos;re all going to be in limelight . - What are you cooking up ?
well , a young man called this morning , said his name was Graham , and he wants to interview everybody in this house .
- Interview everybody ?
- That &apos;s what he said .
he &apos;s being sent around the country by some kind of institute or committee and he has to pick a representative American family and ask them questions .
it &apos;s a kind of a poll . it &apos;s called the National Public Survey .
wonder how he happened to pick this family ?
well , he said he wanted a typical American family .
I told him we weren &apos;t a typical American family .
if he &apos;s going to ask a lot of questions , he can leave me out of it .
Oh , but you could tell him so much more than any of us could .
- He &apos;s going to take our pictures too .
- Pictures .
my , isn &apos;t that lovely ?
you see , there were really , there were two young men .
one of them takes the pictures .
- Oh , there were two .
- Yes . Mr Graham was the nicest .
Oh , he doesn &apos;t want us to dress up or anything .
he just wants us to act the way we always do .
Emmy , women are fools .
they &apos;d fall for anything .
why do you let two strangers come and turn this place upside down .
why expose the family to a couple of snoopers ?
- You should have more sense .
- Why , Charles , I -
- Good morning , Uncle Charlie .
- Good morning , Charlie .
your mother says the Newtons have been picked for all-American suckers .
- What do you know about it ?
- Charlie wasn &apos;t here when they came .
but really , the way Mr Graham told it , it wasn &apos;t like snooping at all .
it was our duty as citizens . it &apos;s something the government wants .
- Government ? - Well , it &apos;s for the public good .
I told them about you andtheplaces you &apos;ve been and he was very interested .
now , listen , Emmy . I &apos;ll have nothing to do with this .
I &apos;m just a visitor here and my advice to you is to slam the door in his face .
Oh . well , I-I couldn &apos;t do that .
but you don &apos;t have to meet him if you don &apos;t want to .
well , I think I &apos;d be kind of exciting .
he &apos;d take your photograph and then we could have it for nothing .
no thank you . I &apos;ve never been photographed and I don &apos;t want to be .
Oh , Charles , how can you talk that way ?
I had a photograph of you . I gave it to Charlie .
I tell you , there are none .
I guess you &apos;ve forgotten this one .
get it , Charlie .
you sure you don &apos;t remember ?
of course I don &apos;t ever remember being photographed .
46 Burnham Street .
Mm-hm . it was taken the Christmas you got your bicycle .
- Just before your accident .
- Uncle Charlie , you were beautiful .
wasn &apos;t he , though ? and such a quiet boy . always reading .
Papa shouldn &apos;t have got you that bicycle .
you didn &apos;t know how to handle it .
he took it right out on the icy road and skidded into a streetcar .
- We thought he was going to die . - I &apos;m glad he didn &apos;t .
he almost did . he fractured his skull , and he was laid up so long .
and then , when he was getting well , there was no holding him .
and it was just as though all the rest he had was too much for him and he had to get into mischief to blow off steam .
he didn &apos;t do much reading after that , let me tell you .
it was taken the very day he had his accident .
a few days later when the pictures came home , how mama cried .
she wondered if he &apos;d ever look the same .
she wondered if he &apos;d ever be the same .
what &apos;s the use of looking backward ? what &apos;s the use of looking ahead ?
today &apos;s the thing . that &apos;s my philosophy . today .
if today &apos;s the thing , then you &apos;d better finish your breakfast and get down to the bank because Joe &apos;ll be waiting .
Charlie , don &apos;t be late back . the survey men are coming at 4 : 00 .
- Good morning , Charlie .
- Hello , Madge .
- Good morning , Charlie .
- Hello , Catherine .
did you see the way they looked at you ? I bet they wonder who you are .
Uncle Charlie , I love to walk with you . I want everybody to see you .
there &apos;s Papa in that window over there .
Hello , Joe . can you stop embezzling a minute and give me your attention ?
Oh , uh ...
Charles , we don &apos;t joke about such things here .
Oh , what &apos;s a little shortage in the books at the end of the month ?
any good bank clerk can cover up alittle shortage .
isn &apos;t that right , Charlie
- Everyone can hear you .
- Good . we all know what banks are .
look all right , but noone knows what goes on when they lock the doors .
can &apos;t fool me , though . well , Joe , let &apos;s see your president .
still want to open that account , Charles ?
that &apos;s why I &apos;m here .
well , uh , you wait right here . I &apos;ll see if Mr Greene &apos;s busy .
and , uh , Charles , he doesn &apos;t care much for jokes about banks .
well , $ 40,000 is no joke . not to him , I bet .
it &apos;s a joke to me . the whole world &apos;s a joke to me .
I &apos;ll be right back .
you shouldn &apos;t tease Papa like that .
I wasn &apos;t teasing him . I just hate this stuffy atmosphere .
they &apos;re waving for us to come in .
- Hello , Mr Greene .
- Hello , Charlie .
well , Mr Greene , this is my brother-in-law , Mr Oakley .
- How do you do ?
- How are you , Mr Oakley ?
well , Mr Greene , I was thinking of settling down here for a while .
great country . great country .
we think so . what have you been doing ?
I suppose you might call me a promoter . I &apos;ve done a little bit of everything .
the only trouble is that once I make the money , I &apos;m not interested in it .
not interested in money ?
you know there &apos;s money just lying around waiting for somebody to pick it up .
I thought maybe I &apos;d put some of my loose cash away for safekeeping .
- In the bank where Joe works , naturally . - Loose cash ?
well , I got in a habit of carrying a lot of cash with me when I was travelling .
- A dangerous habit .
- Never lost a penny in my life .
I guess heaven takes care of fools and scoundrels .
- Yes .
- Thirty , thirty-five ...
Forty thousand . shall we start with forty ?
- If you &apos;ll just write out a deposit slip . - Ah , details .
I &apos;m glad to see you &apos;re a man who understands details , Mr Greene .
they &apos;re most important to me . most important . all the little details .
Oh , dear . I &apos;m sorry . I didn &apos;t know you were busy .
- We can come back .
- Come in , now that you &apos;re here .
Mrs Greene , I &apos;d like you to meet my uncle , Mr Oakley .
Uncle Charlie , this is Mrs Greene and Mrs Potter .
Mrs Greene , Miss Potter .
Mrs Potter .
- Something about you made me think -
- What did you want , Margaret ?
- I need some money to go shopping .
there &apos;s one good thing in being a widow , isn &apos;t there ?
you don &apos;t have to ask your husband for money .
- Here you are .
- Oh , thank you .
- Goodbye , Mr Oakley . - Mrs Potter .
Bye , Mrs Greene .
there . there you are , Mr Greene .
- Charlie , let &apos;s see the town .
- Goodbye , Mr Oakley .
- Bye , Mr Greene .
- Call on us for advice anytime .
- Thank you .
- Joe , you may see Mr Oakley out .
Joe , keep your eyes open . you &apos;ll have his job in a couple of years .
here he is .
those must be the questionnaire men . they &apos;re a whole hour early .
I won &apos;t see them .
you don &apos;t have to if you don &apos;t want to . I &apos;ll see that you don &apos;t .
the way they got around your mother .
I thought she &apos;d have better sense .
- How do you do ?
- How do you do ?
- You must have come to interview us .
- My name is Graham , Miss Newton .
- Oh , how do you do ?
- And this is Fred Saunders .
how do you do ? won &apos;t you come in ?
- I &apos;ll call my mother .
- Thank you .
mother , the government men are here .
will you sit down ?
but you said 4 : 00 . nothing &apos;s ready now .
my husband is still at the bank and-and the house is -
that &apos;s all we want now , Mrs Newton , some pictures of the house .
Saunders can get busy and I &apos;d like to ask a few questions .
alright , but I do wish you &apos;d waited until I had the house looking its best .
I wanted flowers around and fresh curtains in the kitchen .
and there are a lot of things I don &apos;t want you to photograph .
- You said you own the house ?
- Own it ? it owns us .
no sooner do I get one thing fixed than something else gets broken .
and then it needs fresh paint and th-
Mr Saunders , I &apos;m very sorry but you simply cannot take a picture with that chair in it .
- It needs a new slipcover .
- And there are , uh , six in your family ?
- Five .
- Five ? but -
well , my uncle &apos; s just visiting .
I told you about him . he &apos;s here from the East .
my uncle doesn &apos;t want to be bothered with a lot of questions .
well , you see , on a survey , we usually -
he &apos;s not interested in a survey and I promised him he wouldn &apos; t be bothered .
well , we &apos;d like it if we could get all of you .
you know , your opinions , what you do or what you want to do .
my uncle &apos;s opinions aren &apos;t average and I &apos;m afraid they wouldn &apos;t help you .
I think when someone asks for privacy , they should have it .
well , we &apos;ll ... The whole idea of this thing is that -
Mr Graham , perhaps you &apos;d better choose another family .
we &apos;ll do anything you say , of course , but this family seemed right and -
it is a nice family .
Charlie , let the young men go ahead , so long as they &apos;re here .
well , alright .
ok . Saunders , go ahead and get another shot .
Mrs Newton , what organisations do you and your husband belong to ?
how about a picture in the kitchen ?
well , I &apos;m afraid the kitchen isn &apos;t quite the way I &apos;d like it .
come along .
if you &apos;ll start by breakin &apos; an egg , Mrs Newton .
Oh , but you don &apos;t start a cake by breaking an egg .
you have to put the butter and sugar in first .
survey or no survey , I &apos;m not going to start by breaking an egg .
I thought I &apos;d make a maple cake . my brother Charles loves maple cake .
what does your brother do ?
I guess he just does about everything .
what does he do ?
he &apos;s just in business . you know , the way men are .
my husband works in a bank , but I think Charles is just in business .
if you really want a picture of me breaking an egg , you &apos;ll have to wait till I cream the butter and sugar .
I &apos;ll wait .
I wonder if we could take a look upstairs .
you show us , and your mother can call us when she &apos;s ready .
- Alright .
- If you &apos;d rather wait , Mr Saunders .
folding in the eggs has to be done just right .
I can &apos; t beat them and let them stand .
the minute I hear you &apos;ve broken the eggs , I &apos;ll come right down .
Yes .
I really don &apos;t see what you want to look up here for .
whose room is that ? it &apos;s mine . my uncle &apos;s using it now , though .
I &apos;d like to see what your room looks like . typical girl , typical room .
typical of you to ask . my uncle &apos;s resting .
I really don &apos;t want to disturb him .
- Is there a back stairs ?
- Mm-hm . right down the hall .
I &apos;ll bet you 50 cents that your uncle isn &apos;t in there .
Oh , betting &apos;s silly .
all you want to do is photograph my room , doesn &apos;t he ?
- That &apos;s it . - Besides , I know my uncle &apos;s in there .
alright , I &apos;ll still bet he isn &apos;t . let me knock and see .
Oh , I &apos;ll knock .
Uncle Charlie ?
Uncle Charlie , may we come in ?
- See ?
- You were right .
nice room . do you mind if I take a picture since he isn &apos;t here ?
- I don &apos;t want to disturb your uncle .
- Oh , I suppose so .
but I really can &apos;t imagine anyone being interested in my room .
it &apos;s not the way I &apos;d like it . I &apos;d like to have it yellow and white .
might as well let him work in peace .
besides , I &apos;d like to talk to you .
your picking us as an average family gave me a funny feeling .
- What kind of a funny feeling ?
- Oh , I don &apos;t know .
I guess I don &apos;t like to be and average girl in an average family .
average families are the best . look at me .
- I &apos;m from an average family .
- As average as ours ?
sure . besides , I don &apos;t think you &apos;re average .
Oh , that &apos;s because you see me now instead of a few days ago .
I was in the dumps . then Uncle Charlie came and everything changed .
but your mother said he came last night . maybe you just think -
I don &apos;t think . I know .
funny , but when I think about how I feel , I always come back to Uncle Charlie .
are you trying to tell me I shouldn &apos;t think he &apos;s so wonderful ?
- Oh , no . I -
- Mr Saunders ?
- I &apos;m ready with the eggs . - Mr Saunders mustn &apos;t move anything .
- My uncle &apos;s awfully neat and fussy .
- Saunders is neat and fussy , too .
- Is this your uncle ?
- Yes , it is .
now , for one of the hall .
Mr Saunders has been taking pictures of my room .
my sister told me to remind you about eggs and a cake .
I don &apos;t like to be photographed . I &apos;ll have to ask you for the film .
- Oh , Uncle Charlie .
- Give it to me , please .
give it to him , Fred .
that &apos;s too bad . there &apos;s a picture of Mrs Newton on this film .
- Excuse me . - The eggs are ready .
I can &apos;t let them stand another minute .
that was my last roll of film .
Mr Saunders took Uncle Charlie &apos;s picture by mistake and Uncle Charlie made him give him back the roll .
he wasn &apos;t joking about not wanting to be photographed .
we didn &apos;t want to start a family feud .
I &apos;ll get you making the cake again tomorrow .
I won &apos;t be making a cake again tomorrow .
I want to help an important work , but I cannot go on making cakes .
you have helped , Mrs Newton .
and now I &apos;d like to ask another favour .
could I borrow your daughter ? I &apos;d like to look around the town .
- Ann ?
- Charlie .
Ann would be better . Ann knows everything about everybody .
- Charlie .
- Well , if , uh , Charlie doesn &apos;t mind .
- I don &apos;t mind .
- Goodbye , then , Mrs Newton .
- Goodbye . - 6 : 30 ?
- 6 : 30 .
- OK . Goodbye .
- Bye . - Bye , Mr Saunders .
- Bye . Goodbye .
he seems like a nice young man .
but I thought you were going to the movies with Catherine .
Oh , I &apos;ll tell her I don &apos;t feel well or something .
- Hello , Charlie .
- Well ... hello , Catherine .
Hello , Shirley . - Hello .
- This is Jack Graham . he &apos;s in town .
- How do you do ?
- Hello . - How &apos;s your throat , Charlie ?
- Oh , much better .
thank you . bill Forest was asking about you .
Oh . bill Forest ?
well , uh ... goodbye .
- Bye .
- Goodbye .
I know what you are , really .
you &apos;re a detective . there &apos;s something the matter and you &apos;re a detective .
- Charlie , listen .
- I don &apos;t want to listen .
why , you &apos;re not on a survey at all .
you lied to us . you lied to Mother .
you just wanted to get in our house .
police . that &apos;s what it is .
what do you want with us ? why are you here , lying to us ?
look , Charlie , you &apos;ve got to listen to me .
you &apos;ve got to trust me . when you &apos;ve done nothing but lie ?
and you probably didn &apos;t want to take me out at all the way I thought .
you just wanted to ask me a lot of questions .
have I asked you a lot of questions ?
have I ? alright , I &apos;m a detective . a pretty bad one .
now , won &apos;t you even listen to me ?
- Why should I when you lied to me ?
- I had to . when I came here to find a man , I hadn &apos;t counted on you .
- I hadn &apos;t counted on your family .
- Find a man ?
what man ? there &apos;s a man loose in this country .
we &apos;re after him . we don &apos;t know much . we don &apos;t even know what he looks like .
Charlie , think . how much do you know about your uncle ?
why , he &apos;s my mother &apos;s brother . what &apos;s he got to do with it ?
this man we want may be your uncle .
Oh , I don &apos;t believe you . go away and leave me alone .
we &apos;re after one man . your uncle may be that man .
but in the East , there &apos;s another man who &apos;s being hunted too , through Massachusetts and into Maine .
he may be the one . my uncle hasn &apos;t done anything .
he knows it would kill my mother if he did .
he &apos;s her younger brother , just like Roger is mine .
why don &apos;t they arrest that man in the East ?
why don &apos;t you go away and leave us alone ?
Charlie , when we were eating tonight and talking about our folks and what we &apos;d done and how we felt , we were like two ordinary people .
we &apos;d been brought up about the same .
- You liked me and I liked you .
- Oh , it doesn &apos;t matter now .
what do you mean , &quot; It doesn &apos;t matter &quot; ? it &apos;s the only thing that does .
if it weren &apos;t for you , you don &apos;t think I &apos; d care how or where I caught up with your uncle , do you ?
because if he &apos;s the guy , I &apos;m going to catch up with him . remember that .
and you &apos;re going to keep your mouth shut .
you &apos;re going to keep your mouth shut because you &apos;re such a nice girl you &apos;d help if you knew your uncle was the man we wanted .
- I wouldn &apos;t help you .
- And I know you would .
and I &apos;m trying to make it easier for you .
if your uncle &apos;s the man we want , we &apos;ll get him out of town quietly .
- We won &apos;t arrest him here .
- Arrest him here ?
with mother - I &apos;m trying to tell you we won &apos; t .
- Please , Charlie .
- I won &apos;t say anything .
Oh , take me home !
good night , Charlie .
it &apos;s going to be funny when you find out you &apos;re wrong .
good night .
- Hello , Charlie .
home already ?
- Oh , yes , Dad . it &apos;s so nice out , I thought I &apos;d get some air before I went to bed .
you better run in . your Uncle Charlie &apos;s been asking about you .
I think I &apos;ll just go up the back way .
I - I &apos;m tired and I don &apos;t feel like talking .
alright . suit yourself .
- Take care of yourself .
- Mm-hm . - Good night , Herb .
- Good night , Charlie .
good night , Charlie .
what were we saying , Herb ? did I notice what ?
well , did you taste anything funny about that coffee you had at my house this evening ?
no . it tasted all right .
that &apos;s what I mean . it wasn &apos;t all right .
- Put something in it ?
- Put a little soda .
about the same amount that I &apos;d have used if I &apos;d wanted to use poison .
well , you don &apos;t say ? I never tasted a thing .
of course , I might not notice the soda .
you &apos;d notice the soda more than you would the poison .
for all you knew , you might just as well be dead now .
- Aren &apos;t you asleep yet , Ann ?
Charlotte , what are you doing ?
Oh , I &apos;m just looking for a recipe I thought I saw , but it &apos;s just so torn up .
they have papers in the &quot; libarry &quot; , new ones and old ones .
Miss Corcoran will get them out for you .
she won &apos;t even notice if you cut out a little , bitty recipe .
Oh , it &apos;s not that important .
what time does the library close ?
if you read as much as you should , you &apos;d know it closes at 9 : 00 .
Oh , well . if I think about it , maybe I &apos;ll go tomorrow .
you really ought to go to sleep , Ann .
get back there ! get back !
just a moment , Charlie . what do you think I am out here for ?
Oh , I &apos;m sorry , Mr Norton .
alright . go ahead .
Oh ! Miss Corcoran , please let me in .
Oh , please !
Oh , thank you .
really , Charlie . you know as well as I do the library closes at 9 : 00 .
if I make one exception , I &apos;ll have to make a thousand .
I &apos;m sorry , Mrs Corcoran , but there is something in the paper I &apos;ve got to see .
I &apos;m surprised at you , Charlie . no consideration .
- Oh , I &apos;ll only be a minute .
- You &apos;ve got all day to come here .
I don &apos;t know why you want to rush in here tonight like a madwoman .
I &apos;ll give you just three minutes .
can &apos;t be anything really awful .
I &apos;ll prove to him it isn &apos;t .
page three -
Hello .
- Where &apos;s Charlie ?
- Still asleep . I don &apos;t want to wake her .
- Charlie still asleep ?
- No , she just woke up .
I shouldn &apos;t have let her sleep so long , but she needed it .
she doesn &apos;t look quite herself . she &apos;ll be down for dinner .
mother , let me finish mashing those .
I &apos;ll fix the rest of dinner and get it on the table .
you go talk to Uncle Charlie .
- How do you feel ?
- Fine . I must have been tired . I slept like a log .
Uncle Charlie was asking for you again . he &apos;s fond of you .
that nice young man came to ask after you . I told him you were asleep .
I &apos;m rested now . is the gravy made ?
now you &apos;re humming that waltz . please don &apos;t hum that tune anymore .
I &apos;ve just got it out of my head and don &apos;t want it started again .
please remember , don &apos;t hum that tune .
and don &apos;t keep getting up every few minutes .
you just sit there and be a real lady .
alright , if you say so , but at least I can carry in the soup .
Roger , wash your hands ! Joe . Charles .
- Mama - - Ann , don &apos;t put things behind your ear .
and don &apos;t whisper . anyone could hear you a block away .
may I sit by you at the table ?
by me ? I should think you &apos;d want to sit by Uncle Charlie .
- No , I want to sit by you .
- Why do you want to change ?
mother , let her change if she wants to .
Roger doesn &apos;t mind .
no , certainly not . Uncle Charlie might think ... Certainly not .
- Mother , let her change .
- OK , but Ann has some foolish ideas .
go in the dining room , both of you .
what &apos;s going on here ? have I lost my little girl ?
Roger wanted to sit next to you , and I thought it would be nice if the children took turns .
- I never ...
- Never what , Roger ?
- Nothing . - Come , Ann . come and help me .
Joe ! I brought it in by mistake . nothing special in it .
- Want to look at the headlines , Charles ?
- Thank you , Joe .
Roger , don &apos;t make so much noise with your soup .
if he holds his lips together , he could draw it carefully , like a horse .
- Don &apos;t be disgusting .
- May I dip my bread in it ?
- Where &apos;s Charlie ?
- She wanted to serve dinner .
- She &apos; II be in in a minute .
- You &apos;re right , Joe .
nothing special tonight . Oh , here she is !
- Here &apos; s my girl .
- How many hours did you sleep ?
if you could tell me the exact minute you went to sleep , the exact minute you woke up , if you woke up in between and how long you stayed awake each time you woke up , then I could tell you exactly -
you won &apos;t sleep tonight . nobody who sleeps all day can .
I slept all right , and I kept dreaming , perfect nightmares about you , Uncle Charlie .
nightmares about me ?
you were on a train , running away from something and when I saw you on the train , I felt terribly happy .
how could you feel happy seeing Uncle Charlie on a train ?
I don &apos;t want to see him on a train . I hope he stays here forever .
well , he has to leave sometime . we have to face the facts .
I like people who face facts .
well , we &apos;re not going to face any such facts as those .
Oh , Ann , would you like to see the funnies ?
I &apos;m too old for funnies .
I read two books a week . I took a sacred oath I would .
besides , no one &apos;s allowed to read at the table . it isn &apos;t polite .
don &apos;t correct your elders !
she &apos;s right , Emmy . I &apos;m forgetting my manners .
Joe , I &apos;m going to blame this paper on you .
Roger , go to the icebox and bring me a big , red bottle you &apos;ll find there .
you can throw the paper away . Dad &apos;s read it , you &apos;ve read it .
we don &apos;t need to play any games with it tonight .
Ann , you can help Charlie carry the vegetables .
I saw that bottle when I was getting dinner .
St Paul said , &quot; Take a little wine for thy stomach &apos;s sake . &quot;
wine for dinner sounds so gay !
remember they had the champagne when the oldest Jones girl got married ?
this is sparkling burgundy .
one sip and I &apos;ll be calling it &quot; sparkling burgledy . &quot;
maybe I &apos;d better not take any .
Oh ... imported .
imported Frankie and his tweeds ?
and his loaded cane .
his loaded everything !
Roger , go get four of the small glasses with stems .
Charles , I promised Mrs Greene of our club that you &apos;d talk to the ladies .
what am I going to talk about ? travel or current events ?
Oh , not current events . we get current events .
who &apos;ll my audience be ?
Oh , women like myself . busy with our homes , most of us .
women keep busy in towns like this .
in the cities it &apos;s different .
middle-aged widows , husbands dead , husbands who &apos; ve spent their lives making fortunes , working and working , and then they die and leave their money to their wives , their silly wives .
and what do the wives do , these useless women ?
you see them in the best hotels every day by the thousands , drinking the money , eating the money , losing the money at bridge , playing all day and all night , smelling of money .
proud of their jewellery , but of nothing else .
horrible , faded , fat , greedy women .
but they &apos;re alive ! they &apos;re human beings .
are they ? are they , Charlie ?
are they human , or are they fat , wheezing animals ?
hm ? and what happens to animals when they get too fat and too old ?
well , I seem to be making my speech right here .
don &apos;t talk about women like that in front of my club ! you &apos;ll be lynched .
that nice Mrs Potter &apos;s going to be there . she was asking me about you .
the Greenes are bringing her here to the party I &apos;m having for you afterwards .
Joe , it &apos;s Herbert .
he always comes when we &apos;re eating .
good evening , Mrs Newton .
- Good evening , Mr Oakley .
- Good evening .
well , Herb , how &apos;s your mother ?
Oh , she &apos;s just middling .
- Had your dinner ?
- Oh , I had mine an hour ago .
you folks are getting pretty stylish . having dinner later every evening .
ha ha !
- Joe .
- Huh ?
- Joe , I-I picked some mushrooms .
- You don &apos;t say ?
mushrooms mean anything to you , Joe ?
I eat &apos; em on my steak when I &apos;m out and the meat &apos;s not good enough as it is .
if I brought you some mushrooms , would you eat &apos; em ?
suppose I would .
why ? then I &apos;ve got it . the worst I &apos;d be accused of would be manslaughter .
doubt if I &apos;d get that . accidental death , pure and simple .
a basket of good mushrooms and ...
two or three poisonous ones .
no , no . innocent party might get the poisonous ones .
I thought of something better when I was shaving .
a bath tub .
pull the legs out from under you , hold you down .
Oh , what &apos;s the matter with you two ?
do you always have to talk about killing people ?
we &apos;re not talking about killing people .
Herb &apos;s talking about killing me , and I &apos;m talking about killing him .
it &apos;s your father &apos;s way of relaxing .
can &apos;t he find some other way to relax ?
can &apos;t we have a little peace and quiet without dragging in poisons all the time ?
Charlie ! she doesn &apos; t make sense talking like that .
I &apos;m worried about her . Roger , bring her back .
I &apos;ll go . you stay and finish dinner . I &apos;ll catch up with her .
what &apos;s wrong with her ?
- Excuse me , Mr Norton .
- You &apos;re always running around at night .
- Where were you hurrying to last night ?
- Just doing an errand .
- Is this your uncle I &apos;ve heard about ?
- Yes . - Uncle Charlie , Mr Norton .
- Glad to know you . what &apos;s the name ?
Oakley . Charles Oakley . nice to meet you .
better keep your eye on your niece .
I &apos;ll have to give her a ticket for speeding .
- City ordinance about running . - Hear that , Charlie ?
don &apos;t want to break the law . I &apos;ll take care of her .
- Good night .
- Good night .
what &apos;s the matter , Charlie ? what &apos;s wrong ?
- I want to talk to you .
- You &apos;re hurting my arm again .
- Come in here with me .
- I can &apos;t . I don &apos;t go to places like this .
go on in .
- Why &apos;d you bring me here ?
- What does it matter where we are ?
Hello , Charlie .
Hello . Hello , Louise . Uncle Charlie , Louise Finch .
- This is my uncle .
- I was in Charlie &apos;s class in school .
I sure was surprised to see you come in . I never thought I &apos;d see you here .
I been here two weeks . lost my job over at Kern &apos;s .
I &apos;ve been in half the restaurants in town . what &apos;ll you have , Charlie ?
- Nothing , thank you . - A ginger ale for her , a brandy for me .
- Well , Charlie ?
- Well ?
think you know something , don &apos;t you ? that young fellow told you something .
Jack ? why should he know anything about you ?
Charlie , something &apos;s come between us . I don &apos;t want that to happen .
why , we &apos;re old friends .
more than that . we &apos;re like twins .
- You said so yourself .
- Don &apos;t touch me , Uncle Charlie .
what did that boy tell you ?
he &apos;s got nothing to do with it . I hope he never knows anything about you .
Charlie , you &apos;re a pretty understanding sort of girl .
if you &apos;ve heard some little things about me ,
I guess you &apos;re a woman of the world enough to overlook them .
you &apos;re the head of your family , Charlie . anyone can see that .
I &apos;m not so old . I &apos;ve been chasing around the globe since I was sixteen .
I guess I &apos;ve done some pretty foolish things , made some pretty foolish mistakes .
nothing serious , just ... foolish .
Oh , Charlie , now , don &apos;t start imagining things .
how could you do such things ?
you &apos;re my uncle , my mother &apos;s brother .
we thought you were the most wonderful man in the world .
- The most wonderful and the best .
- Charlie , what do you know ?
I &apos;m sorry I was so long . we &apos;re awful busy .
whose is it ? ain &apos;t it beautiful ?
I &apos;d just die for a ring like that .
Yes sir , for a ring like that , I &apos;d just about die .
I love jewellery , real jewellery .
notice I didn &apos;t even have to ask if it was real . you can tell .
- I can .
- Bring me another brandy .
sit down .
sit down !
you think you know something , don &apos;t you ?
you think you &apos;re the clever little girl who knows something .
there &apos;s so much you don &apos;t know . so much .
what do you know , really ?
you &apos;re just an ordinary little girl living in an ordinary little town .
you wake up every day and know there &apos;s nothing in the world to trouble you .
you go through your ordinary little day .
at night , you sleep your ordinary sleep filled with peaceful , stupid dreams .
and I brought you nightmares .
or did I ? or was it a silly , inexpert , little lie ?
you live in a dream . you &apos;re a sleepwalker , blind .
how do you know what the world is like ?
do you know the world is a foul sty ?
do you know if you ripped the fronts off houses , you &apos;d find swine ?
the world &apos;s a hell . what does it matter what happens in it ?
wake up , Charlie . use your wits . learn something !
you goin &apos; , Charlie ?
- Charlie , will you help me ?
- Help you ?
the same blood flows through our veins . I was at the end of my rope .
Oh , I &apos;m so tired . there &apos;s an end to the running a man can do .
you &apos;ll never know what it &apos;s like to be so tired . I was going to ...
then I got the idea of coming out here .
it &apos;s my last chance , Charlie .
give it to me .
Graham and the other fellow , they don &apos;t know .
there &apos;s a man in the east they suspect , and if they get him , I &apos;ll ...
Charlie , give me this last chance .
take your chance .
go ! I &apos;ll go , Charlie . just give me a few days .
think of your mother . it &apos;ll kill your mother .
Yes , it would kill my mother .
take your few days . see that you get away from here .
you realise what it &apos;ll mean if they get me ?
the electric chair .
Charlie , you &apos;ve got to help me .
you said yourself we &apos;re no ordinary uncle and niece , no matter what I &apos;ve done .
you go in . I &apos;ll be in in a minute .
- Home , sweet home .
- Where &apos;s Charlie ?
- She &apos;s outside . don &apos;t worry about her .
- What was the matter ?
she was a little edgy . I persuaded her to go for a walk . she &apos;s calmer now .
- I &apos;m so glad . I &apos;ve saved dessert for you .
- We had an ice-cream soda .
Oops-a-daisy ! off to bed you go !
- Roger , come here !
there &apos;s my girl . psst ! Ann !
Hello ! you must be trying to hide or something .
- We &apos;re not hiding .
- People who are hiding say &quot; psst &quot; .
- We just don &apos;t want to yell on Sunday .
- Look , Ann . ask your sister to run over here . just ask her quietly .
we &apos;ll wait here . - Did my father have a feud with yours ?
- My father ?
because if they didn &apos;t , there &apos;s no sense in my asking Charlotte quietly .
mama won &apos;t care . she thinks girls ought to marry and settle down .
- In a book I &apos;m reading -
- Just ask her , Ann . don &apos;t be literary .
- Alright .
- Remember , I &apos;m doing all the talking .
- Hello .
- Hello .
good morning , Mr Graham .
Catherine , this is Mr Saunders .
- How do you do ?
- How do you do ?
- Ann says you want to speak to me .
- Saunders wants to .
come on , Ann . tell Catherine the story of Dracula .
come on , Catherine .
- What do you want ?
- Let them get a little bit ahead .
it &apos;s about that photograph we took , the one of your uncle .
- He probably burned it .
- Not that one , he hasn &apos;t .
we gave him the wrong film .
we got the picture alright . we wired it East .
they &apos;ve got witnesses can identify the man we want from that picture .
- What do you mean , identify him ?
- Just what I said .
when the witnesses see that picture , we &apos;ll know whether Oakley &apos;s the man .
- We &apos;re waiting for the wire now .
- And then Uncle Charlie will be -
that &apos;s right . that &apos;s the way it is .
Graham thought you could get your uncle to leave town now .
it would be better -
I &apos;ve got to , haven &apos;t I ? I &apos;ve got to ! what &apos;s the most time you &apos;ll give me ?
- Two hours . - I &apos;ll make him leave !
you seem pretty sure he &apos;s the man we want .
why ? no reason why . I &apos;m just scared .
you &apos;re the ones who seem sure .
- I couldn &apos;t bear anything happening here .
- You know what he &apos;s done ?
- No , I don &apos;t want to hear !
- Well , I want you to get this .
we &apos;re doing you a favour .
if you know anything more about your uncle , tell us .
we also want to know when and how he leaves town .
- If you hold out on us -
- I won &apos;t . I &apos;ll tell you .
step on a crack , you &apos;ll break your mother &apos;s back .
I wish I knew we could trust you .
I won &apos;t do anything to help him , I promise .
but you can &apos;t ask me to spy on him .
we &apos;ve made a bargain . I &apos;ll get him to leave . that &apos;s all I &apos;ll do .
think , Charlie . the man &apos;s dangerous . if he gets away from us -
I don &apos;t want to hear what he &apos;ll do . we &apos;ve made a bargain . I &apos;ll keep it .
I &apos;ll let you know when he leaves .
funny if he turned out to be the wrong man . could be .
- Ann !
- I broke my mother &apos;s back three times .
not bad .
you didn &apos;t finish telling me whether Miss Rose married the rich guy ,
- or the one she was in love with .
- How long have you two such friends ?
Oh , we play games . I ask questions . she knows all the answers .
the only trouble is I can &apos;t make out what she &apos;s making up .
I never make up anything . I get everything from my books .
they &apos;re all true .
come on , Ann . we &apos;d better get home and help with dinner . Goodbye .
- Goodbye . - Goodbye , Mr Graham . Mr Saunders .
- Goodbye , Catherine .
- Come on , Catherine .
- Why not pick flowers for the table ? - Simple flowers are the best .
- I didn &apos;t ask for orchids .
- I wish I &apos;d been born in the South .
Southern women have a lot of charm . they pick flowers with gloves on .
- Goodbye , Catherine .
- Goodbye , Charlie . see you after dinner .
Bye .
- Hello , Ann .
- Hello .
how was church , Charlie ? did you count the house ? turn anybody away ?
no , room enough for everyone .
I &apos;m glad to hear that .
show &apos;s been running such a long time , I thought attendance might be falling off .
anything special on the noon broadcast ?
they caught that other fellow , the Merry Widow Murderer .
- They did , did they ?
where ? - State of Maine . Portland .
didn &apos;t catch him exactly .
he was running away from the police , and they cornered him at the airport and he ran into the propeller of a plane .
- Oh , boy !
- Cut him all to pieces .
had to identify him by his clothes .
his shirts were all initialled , &quot; C , &quot; &quot; O , &quot; apostrophe &quot; H. &quot;
well , makes a good ending . couldn &apos;t have done better myself .
I guess that closes that case pretty final .
sure does . never cared much for that case .
well , I think I &apos;ll go get ready for dinner .
I &apos;m hungry . I can eat a good dinner today .
Charlie , I have great news for you . where can we talk alone ?
we got a wire from Maine . we can call off the job .
I &apos;ll bet you &apos;re relieved . I am .
Oh , I am relieved .
you were trying to get youruncle out . he must have thought you were crazy .
now that it &apos;s over , I don &apos;t want to talk about it any more .
I &apos;d like to pretend the whole dreadful thing never happened .
- There &apos;s nothing to pretend about .
- There &apos;s mother &apos;s gloves .
mother and her gloves . she &apos;s always losing things .
all mothers lose things . someday , she &apos;ll be losing you .
mothers don &apos;t lose daughters , they gain sons .
Yes , but gain isn &apos;t always the word . now , take me .
who &apos;d want a detective for a son-in-law ?
- My father would .
- He would ?
if you told him you were going to marry a detective , he wouldn &apos;t disown you ?
it wouldn &apos;t have to be me . there &apos;s Ann .
no , Ann wants to marry a librarian . she told me .
so she &apos;ll always have plenty of books around to read .
what &apos;s the matter ?
I was laughing . it &apos;s been so long since I laughed .
I like it when you laugh .
I like it when you don &apos;t . I guess I like you whatever you do .
- I guess I like you .
- I &apos;m glad . I like you too .
funny how you happen to meet someone and like them and ...
like them .
Mm-hm .
- Charlie ?
I suppose it couldn &apos;t ever really happen some day that you &apos;d tell your father ...
you know , about marrying someone , a detective , I mean .
- I don &apos;t know .
- I didn &apos;t mean to tell you .
I wanted to wait until you &apos;d forgotten the mess we &apos;ve been through together , till you didn &apos;t think of me as part of something unpleasant and frightening .
I wanted to wait and come back and then tell you .
but I can &apos;t help it . I want to tell you now .
I love you , Charlie . I love you terribly .
I know it &apos;s no time to tell you now and I &apos;m sorry . do you mind ?
- I don &apos;t mind .
- Do you think you could think about it ?
- About your loving me ?
- And perhaps your loving me ?
I - I &apos;d like us to be friends . I know that .
- I &apos;d like to have that to think about .
- Nothing more ?
I don &apos;t know , Jack .
I ... just don &apos;t know yet .
alright . but I may come back ?
Oh , please come back . please come back .
listen , Charlie .
when I go , go back to that square in the middle of town .
take a good look at it . that &apos;s where I first knew I loved you .
that &apos;s where we had the fight and I didn &apos;t know what to do .
I like my job , but I didn &apos;t like it that night .
I hated it that night .
- You hate it now ?
- No , not now .
you know , this is a swell place . I &apos;m going to put a bronze plaque up .
that door &apos;s always banging shut !
Oh ! it sticks .
uh !
what are you two locking yourselves in the garage for ?
- When I was young , it was the parlour .
- Hello , Mr Oakley .
- I was saying goodbye to Charlie .
- In the garage ?
the door got stuck . now I &apos;ll have to say goodbye to you .
let &apos;s say goodbye out here on the lawn .
no use taking a chance on the garage .
- Finished here ?
- All finished , but I &apos;ll be back .
- You &apos; II be seeing me around .
not on business , though .
I can understand you coming back . Charlie &apos;s a fine girl .
she &apos;s the thing I love most in the world .
I mean it . have a nice trip , Mr Graham .
and don &apos;t take any more photographs without permission .
rights of man . you know , freedom ?
we &apos;ll have a talk about freedom some day , Mr Oakley .
- Bye .
- Goodbye .
don &apos;t forget to write . remember , you have the addresses .
Jack !
anything else ? I &apos;ve got butter , fruit , green thread and go to the library .
and whatever vegetable looks freshest .
if I &apos;ve forgotten anything , I &apos;ll send Ann .
alright .
mother !
Charlie ! darling ! are you hurt ?
I tripped .
Oh , what is it ? is it your ankle ?
I don &apos;t think I &apos;m hurt . I grabbed the banister .
you might have been killed !
I worry myself sick every time one of you comes down these stairs .
they &apos;re too steep and rickety . they ought to be fixed .
are you sure you &apos;re all right ?
when are you leaving , Uncle Charlie ?
Oh , come now . that other business , it &apos;s all over . I &apos;d like to forget it .
- We &apos;re all happy here .
- When are you leaving ?
I &apos;m not going , you see .
not yet . I &apos;m not going .
I want to settle down . live somewhere people know me . put some money by .
- Start a business . be part of the family . - I see .
the most sensible thing for you to do is to be friends with me .
I can do a lot for you , Charlie , for all of you .
no , not you . we don &apos;t want anything from you .
- I wish I &apos;d told my mother about you .
- I know what you &apos;ve been thinking .
how would your mother have felt ? what would it do to her now ?
how about your father ? his job at the bank ?
what would become of all of you if everything came out ?
you needn &apos;t be afraid . I can &apos;t tell them .
but I &apos;m not afraid . what would you tell ? who &apos;d believe you ?
a waltz runs through your head .
you don &apos;t like the initials on a ring and connect it up with a newspaper clipping .
now , you haven &apos;t even got the ring . I don &apos;t know what became of it .
- You have it . - I ?
I gave it to you .
I don &apos;t want you here , Uncle Charlie . I don &apos;t want you to touch my mother .
so go away , I &apos;m warning you .
go away , or I &apos;ll kill you myself .
see ? that &apos;s the way I feel about you .
- Here you are , Joe .
- Oh , perfume .
- Just the fresh , clean smell of lavender .
- Yeah , I know .
you look very handsome , both of you .
- I &apos;m proud of the two men in my family .
- Emmy , you &apos;re a dream .
it &apos;s a pity the children have to sit on our laps .
it &apos;s going to be a tight squeeze . it won &apos;t do my pants any good .
- Joe , I wish you could drive .
- We do it this way .
- Charles , you &apos;ll sit -
- He can sit in the back with Dad .
the children can fit in beside them .
nonsense . I &apos;m getting a cab . you all go in the taxi .
- Charlie and I &apos;ll go in the car .
- No , Uncle Charlie , you go in the taxi .
I want to ride in the taxi !
course you do . so it &apos;s all arranged .
- Charlie , run out and get the car .
- I &apos;d rather drive the family .
I want you to hear my speech on the way . you &apos;re my severest critic .
anyway , we need a taxi . Ann , go call Mr Abercrombie .
mother !
mother , please ride with me . father can take the children . please !
bet I &apos;ll be the only man outside of Charles fool enough to dress up .
then you &apos;ll be the only other on e to be correct . you look distinguished .
Charles , are you all ready ? Joe , are you ?
wait a minute ! I &apos;ve got to get my overcoat .
please , dear . hurry !
take your time , Emmy . they can &apos;t start till I get there .
it &apos;s getting chilly in here .
KSRO , Santa Rosa , with studios in Vallejo and Santa Rosa , California .
may as well have a little music while we wait .
Oregon State Police pressed theirsearch today for five -
Oh ! does it have to be so loud ?
gets the lower tones better .
I likeit loud ! if the music &apos;s too soft , I can &apos;t tell what they &apos;re playing .
if I have a band , I &apos;m a-least have 87 men .
help , everybody ! somebody &apos;s caught in the garage .
they &apos;re suffocating ! there &apos;s something wrong with the door .
Joe !
I &apos;ll take her . I &apos;ve got her .
Joe , there &apos;s some whisky on my bureau . get it quick .
- Charlie . Charlie .
dear Charlie . - Charlie ?
Emmy , rub her feet . Roger , run get something to fan her with .
Charlie !
Ann , don &apos;t , dear .
Charlie ? what are you trying to say ?
go away .
go away .
Emmy , she wants you .
I &apos;m here , darling . here &apos;s mother . that &apos;s right , my baby .
that &apos;s right , my brave little girl . here .
- Take a little sip of this .
- No , I &apos;m all right .
- Joe , call Dr Phillips .
- No , I &apos;m all right . I just want to get up .
you had a wonderful escape . someone must have left the motor running .
- I couldn &apos;t find the key to turn it off .
- The key was there when I went in .
lucky thing I passed by .
she might have died . you saved her . you knew just what to do .
- Don &apos;t know how I happened across her .
- We &apos;ll put the lecture off .
Oh , yes , there is . I want you all to go . there &apos;s the cab now .
Oh , I couldn &apos;t . I just couldn &apos;t go .
Wh-Who found me in the garage ?
Herb heard you beating on the door .
I was coming across the backyard and I heard gasping &apos; and bangin &apos; .
I figured there must be a human bein &apos; in there .
- Quick thinking , Herb .
- Lucky thing .
I &apos;m glad you happened to be going by , Herb .
come on , Mother .
I
- I want to stay with you .
I don &apos;t feel like making a speech now , when I think what might have happened .
I &apos;m all right . I just want to sit on the porch a while and get the air .
no , darling , I won &apos;t hear of it .
I &apos;m alright , really . I &apos;d rather stay home and get things ready for the party .
darling , I want to stay with you .
Herb , will you take Roger ? Ann , you come with us .
I just don &apos;t understand it . first the stairs and ...
Mr Graham isn &apos;t there ?
this is the Hotel Stewart in Fresno , isn &apos;t it ?
and you don &apos;t expect him ?
I see . thank you .
he isn &apos;t there ? thank you very much . Goodbye .
can you tell me where I can reach him ?
I &apos;ve already tried to get him at the address he gave me in Fresno .
thank you .
mom , may we have some sandwiches ?
don &apos;t take anything from the dining room . go in the kitchen .
please go . and just leave your coats ...
Joe , dear , will you take care of everyone ?
Charlie !
I &apos;ll be right down .
well ... now ... hm .
now , Mr Oakley . I thought champagne was only for battleships !
none for me , nor I &apos;m sure , for my wife .
but we hope you &apos;ll all forget we &apos;re here .
I &apos;d like to propose a toast to ...
isn &apos;t Charlie coming down ?
she &apos;ll be down in a moment . Mrs Potter .
not that one . why do I make tomato ? they always soak through the bread .
try one of these . it &apos;s whole wheat bread and cream cheese .
Paprika makes it pink .
- Mr Greene .
- Mrs Greene , what would you like ?
thank you .
- I think I &apos;d like to propose a toast , too .
to our distinguished visitor , who made the best speech heard in town for years .
to that very good fellow , Mr Oakley .
- Herbie .
- Thank you .
we don &apos; t get many American speakers .
seems like foreigners make the best talkers .
Ah , here she is . now for my toast .
Charlie ...
you &apos;re just in time for a farewell toast .
I hate to break the news to you like this , but tomorrow I must leave Santa Rosa .
- Not forever .
- If that isn &apos;t the strangest coincidence .
- I &apos;m off to San Francisco .
- Charles ?
Oh , Emmy darling , I didn &apos;t mean to spoil your fun tonight .
I got a letter today . I have to catch the early morning train .
I &apos;ll miss you , Emmy .
but I want you all to know I &apos;ll always think of this lovely town ... as a place of hospitality and kindness ... and homes ... homes .
- But I can &apos;t bear it if you go , Charles .
- Oh , Emmy , I &apos;ll be back .
I &apos;ve arranged with Dr Phillips for our little memorial for the children .
it isn &apos;t any of the things you &apos;ve done .
it &apos;s just the idea that we were together again . I &apos;m sorry .
but you see , we were so close growing up .
and then Charles went away , and I got married , and ...
then , you know how it is .
you sort of forget you &apos;re you . you &apos;re your husband &apos;s wife ...
we &apos;ll be looking for you . we feel you &apos;re one of us , don &apos;t we , Margaret ?
indeed . I want to thank you on behalf of our club .
and bless you for your gift to our hospital .
- The children will bless you , too .
- Thank you , sir .
excuse me , sir , but I-I can hear the train coming now .
excuse me .
better get aboard , Charles .
alright . Goodbye , everybody . Roger , Ann , come see the train .
come on , Charlie . you can see they get off .
alright .
I want to see the rooms , the private ones .
I &apos;ve seen berths . I &apos;ve slept in two uppers and one lower with papa .
- Goodbye , Joe .
- Goodbye , Charles .
- Goodbye , Emmy . - Goodbye .
and don &apos;t forget to write !
I will . you write too . I &apos;ll send you my address .
Goodbye .
don &apos;t jump on the seats , Roger .
Roger , what did I tell you ?
porter , there &apos;s one more bag in the other car . will you get it , please ?
Charlie , the train &apos;s going to start . I don &apos;t want to get carried away .
maybe it &apos;s too late ! maybe I &apos;ll have to go along !
there &apos;s plenty of time . you run along , we &apos;ll follow .
Charlie .
just a minute .
I want you to know I think you were right to make me leave .
it &apos;s best for your mother , best for all of us .
you saw what happened to her last night .
she &apos;s not very strong , you know . I don &apos;t think she could stand the shock .
- I remember once , when she was little -
- The train &apos;s moving !
listen , Charlie . I want you to forget all about me .
forget that I ever came to Santa Rosa .
your hands !
let me go , Uncle Charlie ! let me go !
I &apos;ve got to do this , Charlie ... so long as you know what you do about me .
not yet , Charlie . let it get a little faster .
just a little faster .
faster .
now !
Santa Rosa has gained and lost a son , a son that she can be proud of .
brave , generous , kindly . with all of the spendid dignity -
I &apos;m glad you were able to come , Jack .
I couldn &apos;t have faced it without someone who knew .
- I did know more . I couldn &apos;t tell you .
- I know .
he thought the world was a horrible place .
- He couldn &apos;t have been very happy ever .
he didn &apos;t trust people . he seemed to hate them .
he hated the whole world .
you know , he said that people like us had no idea what the world was really like .
well , it &apos;s not quite as bad as that , but sometimes it needs a lot of watching .
it seems to go crazy every now and then .
like your Uncle Charlie .
the beauty of their souls , and characters live on with us forever .
why , hello there , Mr. Neff .
- Working pretty late , aren &apos;t you , Mr.Neff ?
- Late enough . let &apos;s ride .
- You look kind of all in , at that . - I &apos;m fine .
- How is the insurance business , Mr.Neff ? - Okay .
they wouldn &apos;t ever sell me any .
they said I have something loose in my heart .
- I say it &apos;s rheumatism . - Yeah ?
Twelve .
office memorandum .
Walter Neff to Barton Keyes , Claims Manager .
Los Angeles , July 16 , 1938 .
dear Keyes ...
I suppose you &apos;ll call this a confession when you hear it .
well , I don &apos;t like the word confession .
I just want to set you right about something you couldn &apos;t see ... because it was smack up against your nose .
you think you &apos;re such a hot potato as a Claims Manager ... such a wolf on a phony claim .
maybe you are , but let &apos;s take a look at that Dietrichson claim .
accident and double indemnity .
you were pretty good in there for a while , Keyes .
you said it wasn &apos;t an accident . check .
you said it wasn &apos;t suicide . check .
you said it was murder . check .
you thought you had it cold , didn &apos;t you ?
all wrapped up in tissue paper , with pink ribbons around it .
it was perfect .
except it wasn &apos;t , because you made one mistake ... just one little mistake .
when it came to picking the killer , you picked the wrong guy .
you want to know who killed Dietrichson ?
hold tight to that cheap cigar of yours , Keyes .
I killed Dietrichson .
me , Walter Neff , insurance salesman .
35 years old , unmarried , no visible scars ... until a while ago , that is .
Yes , I killed him .
I killed him for money ... and for a woman .
and I didn &apos;t get the money and I didn &apos;t get the woman .
pretty , isn &apos;t it ?
it all began last May .
around the end of May , it was .
I &apos;d been out to Glendale to deliver a policy on some dairy trucks .
on the way back I remembered this auto renewal near Los Feliz Boulevard .
so I drove over there .
it was one of those California Spanish houses ... everyone was nuts about 10 or 15 years ago .
this one must &apos;ve cost somebody about $ 30,000 .
that is , if he ever finished paying for it .
is Mr. Dietrichson in ?
- Who wants to see him ? - My name is Neff . Walter Neff .
- If you &apos;re selling something--
- Look , it &apos;s Mr. Dietrichson I want to talk to ... and it &apos;s not magazine subscriptions .
- Listen , Mr. Dietrichson is not in . - How soon do you expect him ?
he &apos;ll be home when he gets here , if that &apos;s any help to you .
what is it , Nettie ? who is it ?
it &apos;s for Mr. Dietrichson .
I &apos;m Mrs. Dietrichson . what is it ?
how do you do , Mrs. Dietrichson ?
I &apos;m Walter Neff , Pacific All Risk .
- Pacific all what ? - The Pacific All Risk Insurance Company .
it &apos;s about some renewals on the automobiles .
I &apos;ve been trying to contact your husband for the past two weeks ... but he &apos;s never in his office .
ls there anything I can do ?
the insurance ran out on the 15th .
I &apos;d hate to think of your having a smashed fender ... or something while you &apos;re not ... fully covered .
perhaps I know what you mean , Mr. Neff .
- I &apos;ve just been taking a sunbath . - No pigeons around , I hope .
about those policies , Mrs. Dietrichson , I hate to take up your time , but ...
Oh , that &apos;s all right .
if you &apos;ll wait till I put something on , I &apos;ll be right down .
Nettie , show Mr. Neff into the living room .
where would the living room be ?
in there , but they keep the liquor locked up .
it &apos;s all right . I always carry my own keys .
the living room was still stuffy ... from last night &apos;s cigars .
the windows were closed ... and the sunshine coming in through the venetian blinds ... showed up the dust in the air .
on the piano , in a couple of fancy frames , were Mr. Dietrichson and Lola ... his daughter by his first wife .
they had a bowl of those little red goldfish ... on the table behind the big davenport .
but to tell you the truth , Keyes . ..
I wasn &apos;t a whole lot interested in goldfish right then .
or in auto renewals , or in Mr. Dietrichson and his daughter Lola .
I was thinking about that dame upstairs , and the way she had looked at me ... and I wanted to see her again , close ... without that silly staircase between us .
- I wasn &apos;t long , was I ? - Not at all , Mrs. Dietrichson .
- Hope I &apos;ve got my face on straight . - It &apos;s perfect , for my money .
- Neff is the name , isn &apos;t it ? - Yeah .
with two &quot; F &apos;s , &quot; like in Philadelphia , if you know the story .
- What story ? - The Philadelphia Story .
suppose we sit down and you tell me about the insurance .
my husband never tells me anything .
well , it &apos;s on your two cars , the LaSalle and the Plymouth .
we &apos;ve been handling this insurance for Mr. Dietrichson for three years ... and we &apos;d hate to see the policies lapse .
that &apos;s a honey of an anklet you &apos;re wearing , Mrs. Dietrichson .
as I was saying , we &apos;d hate to see the policies lapse .
of course , we give them 30 days .
that &apos;s all we &apos;re allowed to give .
I guess he &apos;s been too busy down at Long Beach in the oil fields .
couldn &apos;t I catch him at home some evening for a few minutes ?
I suppose so . but he &apos;s never home much before 8 : 00 .
that &apos;s fine with me .
you &apos;re not connected with the Automobile Club , are you ?
no , the All Risk , Mrs. Dietrichson . why ?
somebody from the Automobile Club has been trying to get him .
- Do they have a better rate ? - If your husband &apos;s a member .
no , he isn &apos;t .
well , then he &apos;d have to join the club and pay the membership fee to start with .
I never knock the other fellow &apos;s merchandise , Mrs. Dietrichson .
the Automobile Club &apos;s fine .
I can do just as well for you , though .
I have a very attractive policy here .
it wouldn &apos;t take me two minutes to put it in front of your husband .
for instance , we &apos;re writing a new kind of 50 % retention feature ... in the collision coverage .
you &apos;re a smart insurance man , aren &apos;t you , Mr. Neff ?
- Well , I &apos;ve been at it 11 years . - Doing pretty well ?
it &apos;s a living .
you handle just automobile insurance , or all kinds ?
fire , earthquake , theft , public liability , group insurance ... industrial stuff and so on , right down the line .
accident insurance ?
accident insurance ? sure , Mrs. Dietrichson .
wish you &apos;d tell me what &apos;s engraved on that anklet .
- Just my name . - As , for instance ?
- Phyllis . - Phyllis , huh ?
- I think I like that . - But you &apos;re not sure ?
I &apos;d have to drive it around the block a couple of times .
Mr. Neff , why don &apos;t you drop by tomorrow evening around 8 : 30 ?
- He &apos;ll be in then . - Who ?
my husband . you were anxious to talk to him , weren &apos;t you ?
Yeah , I was , but I &apos;m sort of getting over the idea ... if you know what I mean .
there &apos;s a speed limit in this state , Mr. Neff . 45 miles an hour .
- How fast was I going , officer ? - I &apos;d say around 90 .
suppose you get down off your motorcycle and give me a ticket .
suppose I let you off with a warning this time .
suppose it doesn &apos;t take .
suppose I have to whack you over the knuckles .
suppose I bust out crying and put my head on your shoulder .
suppose you try putting it on my husband &apos;s shoulder .
that tears it .
- 8 : 30 tomorrow evening then . - That &apos;s what I suggested .
- Will you be here , too ? - I guess so , I usually am .
same chair , same perfume , same anklet ?
I wonder if I know what you mean .
I wonder if you wonder .
it was a hot afternoon and I can still remember ... the smell of honeysuckle all along that street .
how could I have known that murder can sometimes smell like honeysuckle ?
maybe you would have known , Keyes ... the minute she mentioned accident insurance , but I didn &apos;t .
I felt like a million .
I went back to the office to see if I had any mail .
it was the day you had that truck driver from Inglewood on the carpet .
remember , Keyes ?
Mr. Neff , Mr. Keyes wants to see you .
he &apos;s been yelling for you all afternoon .
is he sore , or just frothing at the mouth a little ?
park this for me , will you , sweetheart ?
- Hello , Walter . - Hi , George .
come on . come on , Garlopis .
you &apos;re not kidding anybody with that line of bull .
- You &apos;re in a jam and you know it . - Says you .
- All I want is my money . - Says you .
all you &apos;re gonna get is the cops . Hello , Walter .
- This is Sam Garlopis from Inglewood . - Sure , I know Mr. Garlopis .
wrote a policy on his truck . how are you , Mr. Garlopis ?
- I ain &apos;t so good . my truck burned down . - Yeah .
every month hundreds of claims come to this desk .
some of them are phonies , and I know which ones .
how do I know ? because my little man tells me .
- What little man ? - The little man in here .
every time one of these phonies comes along , it ties knots in my stomach .
I can &apos;t eat .
yours is one of them , Garlopis .
that &apos;s how I knew your claim was crooked .
so what did I do ?
I sent a tow car over to your garage this afternoon ... and they &apos; yanked up that burned-out truck of yours .
and what did they find ?
they found what was left of a neat pile of shavings .
what shavings ?
the ones you soaked with kerosene and dropped a match on .
look , Mister , I &apos;m just a poor guy . maybe I made a mistake .
that &apos;s one way of putting it .
I ain &apos;t feeling so good , Mr. Keyes .
here . just a minute . sign this and you &apos;ll feel fine .
- Sign what ? - It &apos;s a waiver on your claim . right here .
- Here ? - Here .
now you &apos;re an honest man again . Goodbye , Garlopis .
but I ain &apos;t got no more truck .
$ 2,600 is lot of dough where I live .
what &apos;s the matter , Garlopis , don &apos;t you know how to open the door ?
just put your hand on the knob , turn it to the left .
now pull it toward you .
- That &apos;s the boy . - Thank you , Mr. Keyes .
what kind of an outfit is this , anyway ?
are we an insurance company , or just a bunch of dimwitted amateurs ... to write a policy on a mug like that ?
now , wait a minute , Keyes . I don &apos;t rate this beef .
I clipped a note to that Garlopis application ... to have him thoroughly investigated ...
- before we accepted the risk . - I know you did , Walter .
I &apos;m not beefing at you . it &apos;s the company .
it &apos;s the way they do things .
the way they don &apos;t do things !
the way they &apos;ll write anything just to get it down on the sales sheet .
and I &apos;m the guy that has to sit here up to my neck in phony claims ... so they won &apos;t throw more money out the window than they take in at the door .
okay , turn the record over , let &apos;s hear the other side .
well , I get darn sick of trying to pick up after a gang of fast-talking salesmen ... dumb enough to sell life insurance to a guy ... who sleeps in the same bed with four rattlesnakes .
Walter , I &apos;ve had 26 years of this and let me tell you , I &apos;m getting--
Yeah , and you &apos;ve loved every minute of it , Keyes .
you love it , only you worry about it too darn much , you and your little man .
you &apos;re so darn conscientious , you &apos;re driving yourself crazy .
you wouldn &apos;t even say today is Tuesday unless you looked at the calendar .
then you &apos;d check to see if it was this year &apos;s or last year &apos;s calendar .
then you &apos;d find out who printed the calendar ... and find out if their calendar checked with the World Almanac &apos;s calendar .
now , that &apos;s enough from you , Walter .
now , get out of here before I throw my desk at you .
I love you , too .
I really did , too , you old crab ... always yelling your head off , always sore at everybody .
but you never fooled me with your song and dance . not for a second .
I kind of always knew that behind the cigar ashes on your vest ... you had a heart as big as a house .
back in my office there was a phone message from Mrs. Dietrichson ... about the renewals .
she didn &apos;t want me to come tomorrow evening .
she wanted me to come Thursday afternoon at 3 : 30 instead .
I had a lot of stuff lined up for that Thursday afternoon ... including a trip down to Santa Monica ... to see a couple of live prospects about some group insurance .
but I kept thinking about Phyllis Dietrichson ... and the way that anklet of hers out into her leg .
Hello , Mr. Neff . aren &apos;t you coming in ?
I &apos;m considering it .
I hope you didn &apos;t mind my changing the appointment .
- Last night wasn &apos;t so convenient . - That &apos;s all right .
I was working on my stamp collection anyway .
I was just fixing some iced tea . would you like a glass ?
Yeah , unless you &apos;ve got a bottle of beer that &apos;s not working .
there may be some . I never know what &apos;s in the icebox .
Nettie .
about those renewals , Mr. Neff . I talked to my husband about it .
- Oh , you did ? - Yes . he &apos;ll renew with you , he told me so .
as a matter of fact , I thought he &apos;d be here this afternoon .
- But he &apos;s not ? - No .
that &apos;s terrible .
Nettie !
Oh , I forgot , today &apos;s the maids day off .
never mind the beer . iced tea will be fine .
- Lemon ? sugar ? - Fix it your way .
as long as it &apos;s the maid &apos;s day off , maybe there &apos;s something I can do for you .
- Like running the vacuum cleaner . - Fresh .
I used to peddle vacuum cleaners .
not much money , but you learn a lot about life .
I didn &apos;t think you &apos;d learned it from a correspondence course .
where &apos;d you pick up this tea drinking ?
- You &apos;re not English , are you ? - No . Californian .
born right here in Los Angeles .
they say all native Californians come from Iowa .
- Mr. Neff , I--
- Make it Walter , huh ?
- Walter . - That &apos;s right .
tell me , Walter , on this insurance , how much commission do you make ?
Twenty percent . why ?
I thought perhaps I could throw a little more business your way .
- I can always use it . - I was thinking about my husband .
I worry a lot about him down in those oil fields .
- It &apos;s very dangerous . - Not for an executive , is it ?
he doesn &apos;t just sit behind a desk .
he &apos;s right down there with those drilling crews .
it &apos;s got me worried sick .
you mean , some dark night a crown block might fall on him ?
- Please don &apos;t talk like that . - But that &apos;s the idea .
the other day a casing line snapped and caught the foreman .
- He &apos;s in the hospital with a broken back . - That &apos;s bad .
it &apos;s got me jittery just thinking about it .
suppose something like that happened to my husband .
- It could . - Well ...
- don &apos;t you think he ought to have accident insurance ? - Mmm-hmm .
what kind of insurance could he have ?
enough to cover doctors and hospital bills .
say $ 125 a week cash benefit .
and he &apos;d rate around $ 50,000 capital sum .
- Capital sum ? what &apos;s that ? - In case he gets killed .
maybe I shouldn &apos;t have said that .
I suppose you have to think of everything in your business .
well , your husband would understand .
I &apos;m sure I could sell him on the idea of some accident protection .
why don &apos;t I talk to him about it ?
you could try , but he &apos;s pretty tough-going .
they &apos;re all tough at first .
he has a lot on his mind .
he doesn &apos;t seem to want to listen to anything ... except maybe a baseball game on the radio .
sometimes we sit here all evening and never say a word to each other .
- Sounds pretty dull . - So , I just sit and knit .
is that what you married him for ?
maybe I like the way his thumbs hold up the wool .
anytime his thumbs get tired ...
only , with me around , you wouldn &apos;t have to knit .
- Wouldn &apos;t I ? - You bet your life , you wouldn &apos;t .
wonder if a little rum would get this up on its feet .
I want to ask you something , Walter .
could I get an accident policy for him without bothering him at all ?
how &apos;s that , again ?
it would make it easier for you , too .
you wouldn &apos;t even have to talk to him .
I have a little allowance of my own .
I could pay for it and he needn &apos;t know anything about it .
why shouldn &apos;t he know ?
because he doesn &apos;t want accident insurance .
- He &apos;s superstitious about it .
- A lot of people are . that &apos;s funny , isn &apos;t it ?
if there was a way to get it like that , all the worry would be over .
- See what I mean , Walter ? - Sure . I got good eyesight .
you mean you want him to have the policy without him knowing it .
and that means without the insurance company knowing that he doesn &apos;t know it .
- That &apos;s the setup , isn &apos;t it ? - Is there anything wrong with it ?
no , I think it &apos;s lovely .
then , if some dark , wet night , that crown block did fall on him--
what crown block ?
only sometimes it can &apos;t quite make it on its own , it has to have a little help .
I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
of course , it doesn &apos;t have to be a crown block .
it can be a car backing over him , or he could fall out of the upstairs window .
any little thing like that , just so it &apos;s a morgue job .
are you crazy ? not that crazy .
- Goodbye , Mrs. Dietrichson . - What &apos;s the matter ?
look , baby , you can &apos;t get away with it .
you want to knock him off , don &apos;t you ?
that &apos;s a horrible thing to say .
what &apos;d you think I was , anyway ?
a guy that walks into a good looking dame &apos;s front parlor and says :
&quot; good afternoon , I sell accident insurance on husbands .
&quot; you got one that &apos;s been around too long ?
&quot; one you &apos;d like to turn into a little hard cash ?
&quot; just give me a smile and I &apos;ll help you collect . &quot;
- Boy , what a dope you must think I am . - I think you &apos;re rotten .
I think you &apos;re swell , so long as I &apos;m not your husband .
- Get out of here . - You bet I &apos;ll get out of here , baby .
I &apos;ll get out of here , but quick .
so I let her have it straight between the eyes .
she didn &apos;t fool me for a minute , not this time .
I knew I had hold of a red-hot poker ... and the time to drop it was before it burned my hand off .
I stopped at a drive-in for a bottle of beer , the one I had wanted all along ... only I wanted it worse now , to get rid of the sour taste of her iced tea ... and everything that went with it .
I didn &apos;t want to go back to the office so I dropped by a bowling alley ... at Third and Western and rolled a few lines ... to get my mind thinking about something else for a while .
I didn &apos;t feel like eating dinner when I left , and I didn &apos;t feel like a show .
so , I drove home , put the car away and went up to my apartment .
it had begun to rain outside and I watched it get dark ... and didn &apos;t even turn on the light .
that didn &apos;t help me either .
I was all twisted up inside ... and I was still holding on to that red-hot poker .
and right then it came over me that I hadn &apos;t walked out on anything at all .
that the hook was too strong ... that this wasn &apos;t the end between her and me .
it was only the beginning .
so at 8 : 00 the bell would ring and I &apos;d know who it was without even having to think .
as if it was the most natural thing in the world .
Hello . you forgot your hat this afternoon .
- Did I ? - Don &apos;t you want me to bring it in ?
sure .
put it on the chair .
- How &apos;d you know where I live ? - It &apos;s in the phone book .
- It &apos;s raining . - Yeah .
peel off your coat and sit down .
your husband out ?
Yes . long Beach . they &apos;re spudding in a new well .
he phoned he &apos;d be late . about 9 : 30 .
it &apos;s about time you said you were glad to see me .
I knew you wouldn &apos;t leave it like that .
- Like what ? - Like it was this afternoon .
I must have said something that gave you a terribly wrong impression .
you must never think anything like that about me , Walter .
- Okay . - No , it &apos;s not okay .
not if you don &apos;t believe me . what do you want me to do ?
I want you to be nice to me .
like the first time you came to the house .
it can &apos;t be like the first time .
- Something &apos;s happened . - I know it has .
it &apos;s happened to us .
I feel as if he was watching me . not that he cares . not anymore .
he keeps me on a leash so tight I can &apos;t breathe .
he &apos;s in Long Beach , isn &apos;t he ? relax .
maybe I oughtn &apos;t to have come .
- Maybe you oughtn &apos;t . - You want me to go ?
- If you want to . - Right now ?
sure , right now .
- I &apos;m crazy about you , baby . - I &apos;m crazy about you , Walter .
that perfume on your hair . what &apos;s the name of it ?
I don &apos;t know . I bought it in Ensenada .
you ought to have some of that pink wine to go with it .
the kind that bubbles . all I got is bourbon .
bourbon is fine , Walter .
get a couple of glasses , will you ?
- Club soda ? - Plain water , please .
you know , about six months ago a guy slipped on a cake of soap in his bathtub ... and knocked himself cold and was drowned .
only he had accident insurance .
so they had an autopsy and she didn &apos;t get away with it .
- Who didn &apos;t ? - His wife .
then there was a case of a guy who was found shot .
his wife said he was cleaning a gun and his stomach got in the way .
all she collected was a three-to-ten stretch in Tehachapi .
perhaps it was worth it to her .
see if you can carry that as far as the living room .
it &apos;s nice here , Walter . who takes care of it for you ?
a colored woman comes in a couple of times a week .
- Cook your own breakfast ? - Squeeze a grapefruit once in a while .
- Get the rest down at the corner drugstore . - Sounds wonderful .
just strangers beside you .
you don &apos;t know them and you don &apos;t hate them .
you don &apos;t have to sit across the table ... and smile at him and that daughter of his every morning of your life .
what daughter ? you mean the little girl on the piano ?
Lola . she lives with us .
he thinks a lot more of her than he does of me .
- You ever think of a divorce ? - He wouldn &apos;t give me a divorce .
I suppose because it &apos;d cost him too much money .
he hasn &apos;t got any money . not since he went into the oil business .
but he had when you married him ?
Yes , he had . and I wanted a home . why not ?
but that &apos;s not the only reason . I was his wife &apos;s nurse .
she was sick a long time .
when she died , he was terribly broken up .
- I pitied him so . - And now you hate him .
Yes , Walter . he &apos;s so mean to me .
every time I buy a dress or a pair of shoes he yells his head off .
he never lets me go anywhere . he keeps me shut up .
he &apos;s always been mean to me .
even his life insurance all goes to that daughter of his .
- That Lola . - Nothing for you at all ?
no . and nothing is just what I &apos;m worth to him .
so you lie awake in the dark and listen to him snore and get ideas .
Walter , I don &apos;t want to kill him . I never did .
not even when he gets drunk and slaps my face .
- Only sometimes you wish he was dead . - Perhaps I do .
then you wish it was an accident , and you had that policy for $ 50,000 .
- Is that it ? - Perhaps that , too .
the other night we drove home from a party . he was drunk again .
when we drove into the garage , he just sat there with his head on the steering wheel ... and the motor still running .
and I thought what it would be like if I didn &apos;t switch it off ... just closed the garage doors and left him there .
I &apos;ll tell you what it &apos;d be like .
if you had that accident policy and tried to pull a monoxide job ...
we &apos;ve got a guy in our office named Keyes .
for him a setup like that &apos;d be just like a slice of rare roast beef .
in three minutes he &apos;d know it wasn &apos;t an accident .
in 10 minutes you &apos;d be sitting under the hot lights .
in a half-hour you &apos;d be signing your name to a confession .
but , Walter , I didn &apos;t do it and I &apos;m not going to do it .
not if there &apos;s an insurance company in the picture , baby .
they know more tricks than a carload of monkeys .
and if there &apos;s a death mixed up in it , you haven &apos;t got a prayer .
they &apos;ll hang you just as sure as ten dimes will buy a dollar .
and I don &apos;t want you to hang , baby .
stop thinking about it , will you ?
so we just sat there .
she started crying softly , like the rain on the window , and we didn &apos;t say anything .
maybe she had stopped thinking about it , but I hadn &apos;t .
I couldn &apos;t .
because it all tied up with something I &apos;d been thinking about for years .
since long before I ever ran into Phyllis Dietrichson .
because you know how it is , Keyes .
in this business you can &apos;t sleep ... for trying to figure out all the tricks they could pull on you .
you &apos;re like the guy behind the roulette wheel ... watching the customers to make sure they don &apos;t crook the house .
and then one night , you get to thinking how you could crook the house yourself .
and do it smart .
because you &apos;ve got that wheel right under your hands .
you know every notch in it by heart .
and you figure all you need is a plant out front .
a shill to put down the bet .
and suddenly the doorbell rings ... and the whole setup is right there in the room with you .
look , Keyes , I &apos;m not trying to whitewash myself .
I fought it , only I guess I didn &apos;t fight it hard enough .
the stakes were $ 50,000 , but they were the life of a man , too .
a man who &apos;d never done me any dirt , except ... he was married to a woman he didn &apos;t care anything about .
and I did .
will you phone me ? Walter ?
I hate him . I loathe going back to him .
- You believe me , don &apos;t you , Walter ? - Sure I believe you .
I can &apos;t stand it anymore . what if they did hang me ?
they &apos;re not going to hang you , baby .
it &apos;s better than going on this way .
they &apos;re not gonna hang you because ... you &apos;re gonna do it and I &apos;m gonna help you .
- Do you know what you &apos;re saying ? - Sure , I know what I &apos;m saying .
we &apos;re gonna do it and we &apos;re gonna do it right .
- And I &apos;m the guy that knows how . - Walter , you &apos;re hurting me .
there &apos;s not going to be any slip-up .
nothing sloppy . nothing weak .
it &apos;s got to be perfect .
call me tomorrow . but not from your house . from a booth .
and watch your step every single minute .
this has got to be perfect , you understand ?
straight down the line .
straight down the line .
that was it , Keyes .
the machinery had started to move and nothing could stop it .
the first thing we had to do was fix him up with that accident policy .
I knew he wouldn &apos;t buy , but all I wanted was his signature on an application .
sol had to get him to sign without his knowing what he was signing .
and I wanted another witness besides Phyllis to hear me give him a sales talk .
I was trying to think with your brains , Keyes ... because I wanted all the answers ready ... for all the questions you were gonna spring as soon as Dietrichson was dead .
a couple of nights later I went to the house .
everything looked fine , except I didn &apos;t like the witness Phyllis had brought in .
it was Dietrichson &apos;s daughter , Lola .
and it made me feel a little queer in the belly ... to have her sitting right there in the room , playing Chinese checkers ... as if nothing were going to happen .
I suppose you realize , Mr. Dietrichson ... that , not being an employee ... you are not covered by the State Compensation Insurance Act .
the only way you can protect yourself is by having a personal policy of your own .
Yeah , I know all about that .
the next thing you &apos;ll tell me I need ... earthquake insurance and lightning insurance and hail insurance .
if we bought all the insurance they can think up ... we &apos;d stay broke paying for it , wouldn &apos;t we , honey ?
what keeps us broke is you going out and buying five hats at a crack .
who needs a hat in California ?
dollar for dollar , Mr. Dietrichson ... accident insurance is the cheapest coverage you can buy .
well , maybe some other time , Mr. Neff . I had a tough day .
just as you say .
suppose we just settle that automobile insurance tonight .
sure .
all we &apos;ll need on that is for you to sign the application for renewal .
Phyllis , do you mind if we don &apos;t finish this game ?
- It bores me stiff . - Got something better to do ?
Yes , I have .
father , is it all right if I run along now ?
- Run along where ? who with ? - Just Anne .
- Anne who ? - Anne Matthews .
it &apos;s not that Nino Zachetti again , is it ?
it better not be that Zachetti guy .
if I ever catch you with that--
it &apos;s Anne Matthews , I told you .
and I also told you we &apos;re going roller-skating .
I &apos;m meeting her at the corner of Vermont and Franklin , the northwest corner ... in case you &apos;re interested , and I &apos;m late already .
I hope that &apos;s all quite clear . good night , Father .
- Good night , Phyllis . - Good night , Miss Dietrichson .
- I &apos;m sorry . good night , Mr ...
- Neff .
good night , Mr. Neff .
a great little fighter for her weight .
now , if you &apos;ll just sign these , Mr. Dietrichson .
- Sign what ? - The applications for the auto renewals .
so you &apos;ll be covered until the new policies are issued .
- When will that be ? - About a week .
just so I &apos;m covered when I drive up north .
- San Francisco ? - Palo Alto .
he was a Stanford man , Mr. Neff .
and he still goes to his class reunion every year .
what &apos;s wrong with that ?
can &apos;t I have a little fun , even once a year ?
great football school , Stanford .
- Did you play football , Mr. Dietrichson ? - Left guard .
almost made the varsity , too . where do I sign ?
the bottom line .
- Both copies , please . - Sign twice , huh ?
Yes . one is the agent &apos;s copy .
- I need it for my files . - Files.Duplicates. Triplicates .
thank you , Mr. Dietrichson .
don &apos;t worry about the check , I can pick it up at your office some morning .
- How much you taking me for ? - $ 147.50 .
I think that &apos;s enough insurance for one evening , Mr. Neff .
plenty .
bring me some soda when you come up , Phyllis .
good night , Mr. Neff .
good night , Mr. Dietrichson .
I think you left your hat in the hall , Mr. Neff .
good night , Mr. Neff .
- All right , Walter ? - Fine .
- He signed it , didn &apos;t he ? - Sure he signed it . you saw him .
now , listen . that trip to Palo Alto . when does he leave ?
end of the month .
- He drives , huh ? - He always drives .
not this time . you &apos;re gonna make him take the train .
- Why ? - Because it &apos;s all worked out for a train .
listen , baby .
there &apos;s a clause in every accident policy ... a little thing called double indemnity .
the insurance companies put it in as a sort of come-on for the customers .
that means they pay double on certain accidents .
the kind that almost never happen .
like for instance , if a guy is killed on the train ... they pay $ 100,000 instead of $ 50,000 .
- I see . - We &apos;re hitting it for the limit , baby .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s got to be the train .
it &apos;ll be the train , Walter . just the way you want it .
straight down the line .
Hello , Mr. Neff .
it &apos;s me .
- Is anything wrong ? - I &apos;ve been waiting for you .
for me ? why ?
I thought you could let me ride with you , if you &apos;re going my way .
- Which way would that be ? - Down the hill . down Vermont .
sure . Vermont and Franklin . northwest corner , wasn &apos;t it ?
be glad to , Miss Dietrichson .
going roller-skating , huh ?
- You like roller-skating ? - I can take it or leave it .
- Only tonight you &apos;re leaving it ? - Yes , lam .
I &apos;m having a very tough time at home .
my father doesn &apos;t understand me and Phyllis hates me .
- Sounds tough , all right . - That &apos;s why I have to lie sometimes .
you mean it &apos;s not Vermont and Franklin ?
it &apos;s Vermont and Franklin all right .
only it &apos;s not Anne Matthews . it &apos;s Nino Zachetti .
you won &apos;t tell on me , will you ?
- I &apos;d have to think it over . - Nino &apos;s not what my father says at all .
he &apos;s just had bad luck .
he was doing premed at USC ... and working nights as an usher in a theater downtown .
got behind in his credits , flunked out .
then he lost his job for talking back . he &apos;s so hot-headed .
becomes expensive , doesn &apos;t it ?
guess my father thinks nobody &apos;s good enough for his daughter ... except maybe the guy that owns Standard Oil .
I wish he &apos;d see it my way . I can &apos;t give Nino up .
it &apos;ll all straighten out , Miss Dietrichson .
I suppose it will sometime .
this is the corner right here , Mr. Neff .
Nino ? over here , Nino .
- This is Mr. Neff , Nino .
- Hello , Nino .
the name is Zachetti .
Nino , please . Mr. Neff gave me a ride from the house .
I told him all about us .
why does he have to get told about us ?
we don &apos;t have to worry about Mr. Neff , Nino .
I &apos;m not doing any worrying .
just don &apos;t you broadcast so much .
well , what &apos;s the matter with you , Nino ?
- Why , he &apos;s a friend . - I don &apos;t have any friends .
if I did , I like to pick them myself . come on .
look , sonny , she needed a ride , so I brought her along .
is that anything to get tough about ?
all right , Lola , make up your mind . are you coming or aren &apos;t you ?
of course I &apos;m coming .
don &apos;t mind him , Mr. Neff . and thanks a lot for the ride .
you &apos;re awfully sweet . Nino ?
she was a nice kid .
maybe he was a little better than he sounded .
but right then it gave me a nasty feeling to be thinking about them at all ... with that briefcase right behind my head that had her father &apos;s signature in it ... and what that signature meant .
it meant he was a dead pigeon .
it was only a question of time , and not very much time at that .
you know that big market up on Los Feliz , Keyes ?
that &apos;s the place Phyllis and I had picked for a meeting place .
I already had most of the plan in my head ... but a lot of details had to be worked out .
and she had to know them all by heart when the time came .
we had to be very careful from now on .
we couldn &apos;t let anybody see us together .
we couldn &apos;t even talk to each other on the telephone .
not from her house or at my office , anyway .
so she was to be in the market every morning about 11 : 00 , buying stuff .
and I could sort of run into her there any day I wanted to .
sort of accidentally on purpose .
- Walter , I wanted to--
- Not so loud .
I wanted to talk to you , ever since yesterday .
let me talk first . it &apos;s all set .
the accident policy came through . I &apos;ve got it in my pocket .
I got his check , too . I saw him down in the oil fields .
he thought he was paying for the auto insurance .
the check &apos;s just made out to the company , so it could be for anything .
but you have to send a check for the auto insurance , see ?
it &apos;ll be all right that way , because one of the cars is in your name .
open your bag . quick .
can you get in the safe-deposit box ?
- Yes . we both have keys . - Fine .
but don &apos;t put the policy in there yet . I &apos;ll tell you when .
remember , you never saw it , you never even touched it , you understand ?
- I &apos;m not a fool . - Okay . when is he leaving on the train ?
- That &apos;s just it . he isn &apos;t going . - What ?
that &apos;s what I &apos;ve been trying to tell you . the trip is off .
what happened ?
mister , could you reach me that package of baby food ?
that one up there ?
I don &apos;t know why they always put what I want on the top shelf .
go ahead . I &apos;m listening .
he had a fall-down at the well . broke his leg . it &apos;s in a cast .
- Broke his leg ? - What do we do now , Walter ?
- Nothing . we just wait . - Wait for what ?
until he can take the train .
I told you it &apos;s got to be the train .
but we can &apos;t wait . I can &apos;t go on like this .
look , we &apos;re not gonna grab a hammer and do it quick , just to get it over with .
- There are other ways . - We &apos;re not gonna do it other ways .
but we can &apos;t leave it like this .
what do you suppose would happen if he found out about the accident policy ?
plenty . but not as bad as sitting in that death house .
- Don &apos;t ever talk like that .
- Don &apos;t let &apos;s start losing our heads , that &apos;s all .
it &apos;s not our heads . it &apos;s our nerve we &apos;re losing .
excuse me .
we &apos;re gonna do it right . that &apos;s all I said .
it &apos;s the waiting that &apos;s getting me .
it &apos;s getting me just as bad , baby .
- But we &apos;ve got to wait . - Maybe we have , Walter , only ... it &apos;s so tough without you .
it &apos;s like a wall between us .
I better go , baby . I &apos;m thinking of you every minute .
after that , a full week went by and I didn &apos;t see her once .
I tried to keep my mind off her and off the whole idea .
I kept telling myself that maybe those Fates they say watch over you ... had gotten together and broken his leg to give me a way out .
then it was the 15th of June . you may remember that date , Keyes .
you came into my office around 3 : 00 in the afternoon .
Hello , Keyes .
I just came from Norton &apos;s office .
the semiannual sales records are out .
you &apos;re high man , Walter .
that &apos;s twice in a row . congratulations .
thanks . how would you like a cheap drink ?
how would you like a $ 50 cut in salary ?
- Do I laugh now or wait till it gets funny ? - No , I &apos;m serious .
I &apos;ve just been talking to Norton .
too much stuff piling up on my desk .
too much pressure on my nerves .
I spend half the night walking up and down in my bed .
I &apos;ve got to have an assistant and I thought of you .
me ? why pick on me ?
well , because I &apos;ve got a crazy idea you might be good at the job .
that &apos;s crazy , all right . I &apos;m a salesman .
Yeah . a peddler , a gladhander , a backslapper .
you &apos;re too good to be a salesman .
- Nobody &apos;s too good to be a salesman . - Phooey !
all you guys do is just ring doorbells and dish out a smooth line of monkey talk .
what &apos;s troubling you is that $ 50 cut , isn &apos;t it ?
- Well , that &apos;d trouble anybody . - Now look , Walter .
the job I &apos;m talking about takes brains and integrity .
it takes more guts than there is in 50 salesmen .
it &apos;s the hottest job in the business .
Yeah , but it &apos;s still a desk job .
- I don &apos;t want to be nailed to a desk . - Deskjob ?
is that all you can see in it ?
just a hard chair to park your pants on from 9 : 00 to 5 : 00 , huh ?
just a pile of papers to shuffle around , and five sharp pencils ... and a scratch pad to make figures on , maybe a little doodling on the side .
well , that &apos;s not the way I look at it , Walter .
to me , a claims man is a surgeon , that desk is an operating table ... and those pencils are scalpels and bone chisels .
and those papers are not just forms and statistics and claims for compensation .
they &apos;re alive .
they &apos;re packed with drama ... with twisted hopes and crooked dreams .
a claims man , Walter , is a doctor and a bloodhound and a--
who ? okay , hold on a minute .
a claims man is a doctor and a bloodhound and a cop and a judge and a jury ... and a father confessor , all in one .
and you want to tell me you &apos;re not interested ?
you don &apos;t want to work with your brains ?
all you want to work is with your finger on the doorbell ... for a few bucks more a week .
there &apos;s a dame on your phone .
- Walter Neff speaking . - I had to call you , Walter .
it &apos;s very urgent . are you with somebody ?
Yes , I am . can &apos;t I call you back , Margie ?
no , you can &apos;t . I &apos;ve only got a minute . it can &apos;t wait .
listen . he &apos;s going tonight . on the train .
Walter ? Yeah . I &apos;m listening , Margie .
- Only , make it snappy , will you ? - He &apos;s on crutches .
the doctor says he can go if he &apos;s careful .
the change will do him good .
it &apos;s wonderful , Walter . just the way you wanted it , on a train .
only with the crutches it makes it much better , doesn &apos;t it ?
Yeah . Yeah , that &apos;s 100 % better .
hold the line a minute , will you ?
- Keyes , suppose I join you in your office ?
- That &apos;s all right . I &apos;ll wait .
only tell her not to take all day .
go ahead .
it &apos;s the 10 : 15 from Glendale . I &apos;m driving him .
it &apos;s still the same dark street , isn &apos;t it ?
and the signal is three honks on the horn . okay . anything else ?
no .
Oh , uh ... what color did you pick ?
blue . Navy blue . and the cast is on his left leg .
Mmm-hmm .
Yeah , that suits me fine .
this is it , Walter . I &apos;m shaking like a leaf .
but it &apos;s straight down the line for both of us .
I love you , Walter . Goodbye .
- Sorry , Keyes . - What &apos;s the matter ?
dames chasing you again ? or still ? or is it none of my business ?
if I told you it was a customer--
Margie . I bet she drinks from the bottle .
why don &apos;t you settle down and get married , Walter ?
- Why don &apos;t you , for instance ? - I almost did , once . long time ago .
now look , Keyes , I &apos;ve got to call on a prospect .
even had the church picked out , the dame and I .
she had a white satin dress with flounces on it .
I was on my way to the jewelry store to buy the ring .
and then suddenly that little man in here started working on me .
so you went back and had her investigated ?
Yeah . and the stuff that came out ...
she &apos;d been dyeing her hair ever since she was 16 .
there was a manic depressive in her family , on her mother &apos;s side .
she already had one husband .
he was a professional pool player in Baltimore .
- And as for her brother-- - I get the general idea .
- She was a tramp from a long line of tramps .
- Yeah . all right , all right .
now what do I say to Norton ? what about this job I want you for &apos; ?
I don &apos;t think I want it , Keyes .
- Thanks just the same . - Fair enough .
only get this , I picked you for the job ... not because I think you &apos;re so darn smart ... but because I thought you were a shade less dumb than the rest of the outfit .
guess I was wrong . you &apos;re not smarter , Walter .
you &apos;re just a little taller .
Yes , Keyes .
those Fates I was talking about had only been stalling me off .
now they had thrown the switch . the gears had meshed .
the time for thinking had all run out .
I wanted my movements accounted for up to the last possible moment .
so when I left the office I put my rate book on the desk as if I had forgotten it .
that was part of my alibi .
from here on , it was a question of following the timetable ... move by move .
I got home about 7 : 00 and drove right into the garage .
this was another item to establish my alibi .
- Hi , Mr. Neff . - Hello , Charlie .
how about giving the heap a wash job ?
how soon you gonna want it ?
I got a couple cars ahead of you .
any time you get to it , Charlie .
- I &apos;m staying in tonight . - Okay .
up in my apartment I called Lou Schwartz ... one of the salesmen that shared my office .
he lived in Westwood , so it was a toll call and there &apos;d be a record of it .
I told him I &apos;d forgotten my rate book and needed some dope ... on the public liability bond I was figuring .
I changed into a navy blue suit like Dietrichson was going to wear .
Lou Schwartz called me back and gave me a lot of figures .
I stuffed a hand towel and a roll of adhesive into my pockets ... so I could fake something that looked like a cast on a broken leg .
next , I stuck a card inside the telephone box ... so that it would fall down if the bell rang .
that way I &apos;d know if anybody had called me while I was away .
then I did the same thing to the doorbell in case anybody came to see me .
I left the apartment by the service stairs . nobody saw me .
I walked all the way from my apartment to the Dietrichson house .
I didn &apos;t want to take the bus ... because there was always the chance that someone might remember seeing me on it .
I was being that careful .
I could smell that honeysuckle again .
only it was even stronger , now that it was night .
I slid the garage door open as quietly as I could .
she &apos;d backed the sedan in , just the way I told her to .
I &apos;d figured it was safer that way ... in case he got into the car before she drove it out .
I got into the back of the car .
I lay there on the floor and waited .
all the time I was thinking about that dark street on the way to the station ... where I was to do it ... and the three honks on the horn that were to be the signal .
about 10 minutes later they came down .
- All right , honey ? - Yeah , I &apos;m all right .
I &apos;ll have the car out in a second .
- Take it easy , honey . - We &apos;ve got lots of time . Yeah .
remember what the doctor said .
if you get careless ... you might end up with a shorter leg .
so what ? I could break the other one and match them up again .
it makes you feel pretty good to get away from me , doesn &apos;t it ?
it &apos;s only for four days . I &apos;ll be back Monday at the latest .
this is not the right street . why did you turn here ?
what are you doing that for ?
what are you honking the horn for ?
you take care of the redcap and the conductor .
- Don &apos;t worry . - Keep away from me as much as you can .
- Tell them I don &apos;t want to be helped .
- I said , don &apos;t worry , Walter .
you start as soon as the train leaves .
when you get to the refinery , turn off the highway onto the dirt road .
from there it &apos;s exactly eight-tenths of a mile ... to the dump beside the tracks .
- I remember everything . - No speeding .
you don &apos;t want any oops stopping you with him in the back .
Walter , we &apos;ve been through all that so many times .
when you leave the highway , turn off all your lights .
I &apos;ll be back on the observation platform .
I &apos;ll drop off as close to the spot as I can .
let the train pass , then dim your lights twice .
- San Francisco train , lady ? - Car 9 , section 11 .
just my husband .
car 9 , section 11 ? this way please .
thank you . my husband doesn &apos;t like to be helped .
car number 8 . up there .
car 9 , section 11 . thank you .
here &apos;re the tickets . take good care of yourself with that leg .
Yeah . you take it easy driving home .
- I &apos;ll miss you , honey . - Section 11 , sir .
- All aboard ! - Thank you .
- Goodbye , honey . - All aboard !
good luck , honey .
porter , will you make up my berth right away ?
Yes , sir .
I &apos;m going back to the observation oar for a smoke .
right this way , sir .
like a chair ?
no , thanks . I &apos;d rather stand .
- You going far ? - Palo Alto .
my name &apos;s Jackson .
I &apos;m going all the way to Medford . Medford , Oregon .
I had a broken arm once .
that darn cast itches something fierce , doesn &apos;t it ?
I thought I &apos;d go crazy with mine .
Palo Alto &apos;s a nice little town . you a Stanford man ?
- I used to be . - I &apos;ll bet you left something behind .
I always do .
my cigar case .
I guess I left it in my overcoat back in the section .
would you care to roll yourself a cigarette , Mister--
Dietrichson .
no thanks , I really prefer a cigar .
- Maybe the porter could-- - Well , I could get your cigars for you .
- Be glad to , Mr. Dietrichson . - If it &apos;s not too much trouble .
- Car 9 , section 11 . - Car 9 , section 11 .
with pleasure .
okay . this has gotta be fast .
here , take his hat . pick up the crutches back on the tracks .
okay , baby . that &apos;s it .
all right . let &apos;s go .
on the way back , we went over once more ... what she was to do at the inquest ... if they had one , and about the insurance , when that came up .
I was afraid she might go to pieces a little , now that we had done it .
but she was perfect . no nerves .
not a tear , not even a blink of the eyes .
she dropped me a block from my apartment house .
Walter , what &apos;s the matter ? aren &apos;t you going to kiss me ?
it &apos;s straight down the line , isn &apos;t it ?
- I love you , Walter . - I love you , baby .
it was two minutes past 11 : 00 , as I went up the service stairs again .
nobody saw me this time either .
in the apartment I checked the bells .
the cards hadn &apos;t moved . no calls . no visitors .
then I changed my clothes again .
that left one last thing to do .
I had to go down to the garage . I wanted Charlie to see me again .
you gonna use your oar , after all ? I &apos;m not quite through .
well , that &apos;s all right , Charlie .
just going up to the drugstore to get something to eat .
been working upstairs all night .
my stomach &apos;s getting a little sore at me .
Yes , sir , Mr. Neff .
that was all there was to it .
nothing had slipped , nothing had been overlooked .
there was nothing to give us away .
and yet , Keyes , as I was walking down the street to the drugstore ... suddenly it came over me that everything would go wrong .
it sounds crazy , Keyes , but it &apos;s true , so help me .
I couldn &apos;t hear my own footsteps .
it was the walk of a dead man .
that was the longest night lever lived through , Keyes ... and the next day was worse , when the story had broke in the papers ... and they started talking about it at the office ... and the day after that , when you started digging into it .
I kept my hands in my pockets because I thought they were shaking .
I put on dark glasses so people couldn &apos;t see my eyes .
and then I took them off again so they wouldn &apos;t get to wondering why I wore them .
I tried to hold myself together , but ...
I could feel my nerves pulling me to pieces .
- Oh , Walter ? - Hello , Keyes .
come along . the big boss wants to see us .
- The Dietrichson case ? - Must be .
- Anything wrong ? - Well , the guy is dead .
we had him insured and it &apos;s gonna cost us dough .
that &apos;s always wrong .
- What have they got so far ? - Autopsy report .
no heart failure , no apoplexy , no predisposing medical cause of any kind .
died of a broken neck .
- When &apos;s the inquest ? - Had it this morning .
his wife and daughter made the identification .
the train people and some of the passengers told how he went through ... to the observation car .
it was all over in 45 minutes . verdict ? accidental death .
what do the police figure ?
that he got tangled up in his crutches and fell off the train .
they &apos;re satisfied .
it &apos;s not their dough . come on , Walter .
all right . thank you very much , gentlemen .
I believe the legal position is now clear .
please stand by . I may need you later .
come in , Mr. Keyes . you , too , Mr. Neff .
you find this an uncomfortably warm day , Mr. Keyes ?
I &apos;m sorry , Mr. Norton , but I didn &apos;t know this was formal .
sit down , gentlemen . thank you .
any new developments ?
I just talked to this Jackson long distance , up in Medford , Oregon .
who &apos;s Jackson ?
he &apos;s the last man who saw Dietrichson alive .
they were out on the observation platform together , talking .
Dietrichson wanted a cigar and so Jackson went back ... to get Dietrichson &apos;s cigar case for him .
when he returned to the observation platform , no Dietrichson .
well , Jackson didn &apos;t think anything was wrong until ... a wire caught up with the train at Santa Barbara .
they found Dietrichson &apos;s body on the tracks near Burbank .
very interesting about the cigar case .
- Anything else ? - No , not much .
Dietrichson &apos;s secretary says she didn &apos;t know anything about the policy .
there &apos;s a daughter , but all she remembers is Neff talking to her father ... about accident insurance at their house one night .
I couldn &apos;t sell him at first .
Mr. Dietrichson opposed it . he said he &apos;d think it over .
later I saw him in the oil fields and closed him .
he signed the application and gave me his check .
a fine piece of salesmanship that was , Mr. Neff .
well , there &apos;s no sense in pushing Neff around .
he &apos;s got the best sales record in the office .
are your salesmen supposed to know a customer is going to fall off the train ?
fall off a train ? are we sure Dietrichson fell off the train ?
- I don &apos;t get it . - You don &apos;t , Mr. Keyes ?
then what do you think of this case ?
this policy might cost us a great deal of money .
as you know , it contains a double indemnity clause .
just what is your opinion ?
- No opinion at all . - Not even a hunch ?
one of those interesting little hunches of yours ?
Nope . not even a hunch .
I &apos;m surprised , Mr. Keyes . I &apos;ve formed a very definite opinion .
I think I know .
in fact , I know I know what happened to Dietrichson .
you know you know what ? I know it was not an accident .
- What do you say to that ? - Me ?
well , you &apos;ve got the ball . let &apos;s see you run with it .
there &apos;s a widespread feeling that just because a man has a large office--
Yes ? have her come in , please .
there &apos;s a widespread feeling that ... just because a man has a large office , he must be an idiot .
I &apos;m having a visitor , if you don &apos;t mind .
no , no . I want you to stay and watch me handle this .
Mrs. Dietrichson .
thank you very much for coming , Mrs. Dietrichson .
I assure you I appreciate it . this is Mr. Keyes .
- How do you do ? - How do you do ?
- And Mr. Neff . - I &apos;ve met Mr. Neff . how do you do ?
- Mrs. Dietrichson . - Won &apos;t you sit down ?
may I extend our sympathy in your bereavement ?
I hesitated before asking you to come here so soon after your loss .
but now that you &apos;re here I hope you won &apos;t mind if I plunge straight into business ?
you know why we asked you to come , don &apos;t you ?
no . all I know is that your secretary made it sound very urgent .
your husband had an accident policy with this company .
evidently you don &apos;t know that , Mrs. Dietrichson .
no . I remember some talk at the house , but he didn &apos;t seem to want it .
your husband took the policy out a few days later , Mrs. Dietrichson .
you &apos;ll probably find the policy among his personal effects .
his safe-deposit box hasn &apos;t been opened yet .
it seems a tax examiner has to be present .
please , Mrs. Dietrichson , I don &apos;t want you to think ... you &apos;re being subjected to any questioning ... but there are a few things we should like to know .
what sort of things ?
we have the report of the coroner &apos;s inquest .
accidental death . we are not entirely satisfied .
in fact , we are not satisfied at all .
frankly , Mrs. Dietrichson , we suspect ... a suicide .
- I &apos;m sorry . would you like a glass of water ? - Please .
thank you .
had your husband been depressed or moody lately , Mrs. Dietrichson ?
did he have financial worries , for instance ?
he was perfectly all right and I don &apos;t know of any financial worries .
let us examine this so-called accident .
first , your husband takes out this policy in absolute secrecy .
because he doesn &apos;t want his family to suspect what he intends to do .
- Do what ? - Next , he goes on this trip entirely alone .
he has to be alone .
he hobbles all the way out to the observation platform .
very unlikely with his leg in a cast , unless he has a very strong reason .
once there , he finds he is not alone . there is a man there .
- What was his name , Keyes ?
- His name was Jackson . probably still is .
so he gets rid of this Jackson with some flimsy excuse about cigars .
- And then he is alone . and then he does it . - Does what ?
he jumps . suicide . in which case , the company is not liable .
you know that , of course . now , we could go to court--
I don &apos;t know anything . in fact , I don &apos;t know why I came here .
just a moment , please .
I said we could go to court . I didn &apos;t say we want to .
what I want to suggest is a compromise on both sides .
a settlement for a certain sum , a part of the policy value .
don &apos;t bother , Mr. Norton .
when I came in here , I had no idea you owed me any money .
you told me you did . then you told me you didn &apos;t .
now you tell me you want to pay me a part of it , whatever it is .
you want to bargain with me , at a time like this .
I don &apos;t like your insinuations about my husband , and I don &apos;t like your methods .
in fact , I don &apos;t like you , Mr. Norton . Goodbye , gentlemen .
nice going , Mr. Norton . you sure carried that ball .
only you fumbled on the goal line .
then you heaved an illegal forward pass and got thrown for a 40-yard loss .
now you can &apos;t pick yourself up because you haven &apos;t got a leg to stand on .
I haven &apos;t , eh ? she can go to court and we can prove it was suicide .
Oh , can we ?
Mr. Norton , the first thing that struck me was that suicide angle .
only I dumped it into the wastepaper basket just three seconds later .
you know , you ought to take a look at the statistics on suicide sometime .
you might learn a little something about the insurance business .
Mr. Keyes , I was raised in the insurance business .
Yeah , in the front office .
come now , you &apos;ve never read an actuarial table in your life , have you ?
why , they &apos;ve got 10 volumes on suicide alone .
suicide by race , by color , by occupation ... by sex , by seasons of the year , by time of day .
suicide , how committed ?
by poisons , by firearms , by drowning , by leaps .
suicide by poison , subdivided by types of poison ... such as corrosive , irritant , systemic , gaseous , narcotic ... alkaloid , protein , and so forth .
suicide by leaps , subdivided by leaps from high places ... under the wheels of trains , under the wheels of trucks ... under the feet of horses , from steamboats .
but , Mr. Norton ... of all the cases on record there &apos;s not one single case of suicide by leap ... from the rear end of a moving train .
and do you know how fast that train was going ... at the point where the body was found ?
15 miles an hour .
now how can anybody jump off a slow moving train like that ... with any kind of expectation that he would kill himself ?
no . no soap , Mr. Norton .
we &apos;re sunk , and we &apos;ll have to pay through the nose , and you know it .
may I have this ?
come on , Walter .
next time I &apos;ll rent a tuxedo .
I could have hugged you right then and there , Keyes ... you and your statistics .
you were the only one we were really scared of ... and instead you were almost playing on our team .
that evening when I got home , my nerves had eased off .
I could feel the ground under my feet again .
and it looked like easy going from there on in .
that $ 100,000 looked as safe for Phyllis and me ... as if we had the check already deposited in the bank .
Hello ? Oh , hello , baby . sure , everything is fine .
you were wonderful in Norton &apos;s office .
I felt so funny , I wanted to look at you all the time .
how do you think I felt , baby ? where are you ?
at the drugstore . just a block away .
- Can I come up ? - Okay . but be careful .
don &apos;t let anybody see you .
Hello , Keyes .
- What &apos;s on your mind ? - That broken leg .
- The guy had a broken leg . - What are you talking about ?
talking about Dietrichson . he had accident insurance , didn &apos;t he ?
- Yeah . - Then he broke his leg , didn &apos;t he ?
- So what ? - And he didn &apos;t put in a claim .
- Why didn &apos;t he put in a claim ? why ? - What are you driving at ?
Walter , I had dinner two hours ago and it stuck half way .
that little man of yours is acting up again , huh ?
there &apos;s something wrong with the Dietrichson case .
why ? because he didn &apos;t file a claim ?
maybe he just didn &apos;t have time .
maybe he just didn &apos;t know that he was insured .
no . no , that couldn &apos;t be it .
you delivered the policy to him personally , didn &apos;t you ?
- Yeah . - You got his check ?
sure I did .
- Got any bicarbonate of soda ? - No , I haven &apos;t .
Walter , I &apos;ve been living with this little man for 26 years .
and he &apos;s never failed me yet . there &apos;s got to be something wrong .
well , maybe Norton was right . maybe it was suicide .
no . not suicide .
- But not an accident , either . - What else ?
now look , Walter .
a guy takes out an accident policy that &apos;s worth $ 100,000 ..
if he &apos;s killed on a train .
then two weeks later , he is killed on a train .
and not in a train accident , mind you , but falling off some silly observation oar .
do you know what the mathematical probability of that is ?
one out of I don &apos;t know how many billions .
and add to that the broken leg .
no , it just can &apos;t be the way it looks .
- Something has been worked on us . - Such as what ?
murder ?
don &apos;t you have any peppermint or something ?
- Sorry . want a little soda water ? - No , no , no .
who do you suspect ?
maybe I like to make things easy for myself .
but I always tend to suspect the beneficiary .
- You mean the wife ? - Yeah .
that wide-eyed dame that just didn &apos;t know anything about anything .
you &apos;re crazy , Keyes . she wasn &apos;t even on the train .
I know she wasn &apos;t , Walter .
I don &apos;t claim to know how it was worked , or who worked it ... but all I know is that it was worked .
I &apos;ve got to get to a drugstore .
this thing feels like a hunk of concrete inside me .
- Good night , Walter . - Good night , Keyes .
- See you at the office in the morning . - Yeah .
I &apos;d like to move in on her right now , tonight .
if it wasn &apos;t for Norton and his striped-pants ideas about company policy ...
I &apos;d have the police after her so fast it &apos;d make her head spin .
they &apos;d put her through the wringer ... and , brother , the things they would squeeze out .
only you haven &apos;t got a single thing to go on , Keyes .
not too much .
just 26 years experience ... all the percentage there is , and this hunk cf concrete in my stomach .
can I have one of those things ?
- Good night , Keyes . - So long , Walter .
- How much does he know ? - He doesn &apos;t know anything .
it &apos;s those stinking hunches of his .
and he can &apos;t prove anything , can he ?
not if we &apos;re careful . not if we don &apos;t see each other for a while .
- How long a while ? - Until this dies down .
you don &apos;t know Keyes .
once he gets his teeth into something , he never lets go .
he &apos;ll investigate you , have you shadowed .
he &apos;ll watch you every minute from now on .
- You afraid , baby ? - Yes , I &apos;m afraid .
but not of Keyes . I &apos;m afraid of us .
we &apos;re not the same anymore .
we did it so we could be together , but instead of that it &apos;s pulling us apart .
- Isn &apos;t it , Walter ? - What are you talking about ?
and you don &apos;t really care whether we see each other or not .
shut up , baby .
Pacific All Risk . good afternoon .
Hello , Mr. Neff .
- Hello . - Lola Dietrichson .
- Don &apos;t you remember me ? - Yes . Yes , of course .
could I talk with you just a few minutes ?
somewhere where we could be alone ?
Oh , yes . come into my office .
is it something about what happened ?
Yes , Mr. Neff . it &apos;s about my father &apos;s death .
I &apos;m terribly sorry , Miss Dietrichson .
Lou , do you mind if I use the office alone for a few minutes ?
no . it &apos;s all yours , Walter .
look at me , Mr. Neff .
I &apos;m not crazy . I &apos;m not hysterical . I &apos;m not even crying .
but I have the awful feeling that something is wrong ... and I had that same feeling once before , when my mother died .
when your mother died ?
we were at Lake Arrowhead . that was six years ago .
we had a cabin there .
it was winter and very cold .
my mother was very sick with pneumonia .
she had a nurse with her .
there were just the three of us in the cabin .
one night I got up and went into my mother &apos;s room .
she was delirious with fever .
all the bed covers were on the floor and the windows were wide open .
the nurse wasn &apos;t in the room .
I ran and covered my mother up as quickly as I could .
just then I heard a door open behind me .
the nurse stood there .
she didn &apos;t say a word , but there was a look in her eyes ...
I &apos;ll never forget .
two days later , my mother was dead .
do you know who that nurse was ?
- No . who ? - Phyllis .
I tried to tell my father , but I was just a kid then .
he wouldn &apos;t listen to me .
six months later she married him ... and I kind of talked myself out of the idea she could have done anything like that .
but now it &apos;s all back again , now that something &apos;s happened to my father , too .
you &apos;re not making sense , Miss Dietrichson .
your father fell off a train .
Yes , and two days before he fell off that train , what was Phyllis doing ?
she was in her room in front of a mirror , with a black hat on ... pinning a black veil to it .
as if she couldn &apos;t wait to see how she would look in mourning .
you &apos;ve had a pretty bad shock , Miss Dietrichson .
aren &apos;t you just imagining these things ?
I caught her eyes in the mirror .
they had that look in them they had before my mother died .
that same look .
you don &apos;t like your stepmother , do you ?
isn &apos;t it just because she is your stepmother ?
I loathe her because she did it . she did it for the money .
only you &apos;re not going to pay her , are you , Mr. Neff ?
she &apos;s not going to get away with it this time , because I &apos;m going to speak up .
I &apos;m going to tell everything I know .
- You &apos;d better be careful , saying things like--
- I &apos;m not afraid . you &apos;ll see .
I &apos;m sorry .
I didn &apos;t mean to act like this .
all this that you &apos;ve been telling me , who else have you told ?
no one .
- How about your stepmother ? - Of course not .
I &apos;ve moved out .
I &apos;m not living at home anymore .
and you haven &apos;t told that boyfriend of yours ? Zachetti ?
I &apos;m not seeing him anymore . we had a fight .
where are you living now ?
I got myself a little apartment in Hollywood .
four walls , and you just sit and look at them ?
Yes , Mr. Neff .
so that evening I took her to dinner ... at a Mexican restaurant down on Olvera Street where nobody would see us .
I wanted to cheer her up .
the next day was Sunday and we went for a ride down to the beach .
she had loosened up a bit , she was even laughing .
I had to make sure that she wouldn &apos;t tell that stuff about Phyllis to anybody else .
it was dynamite , whether it was true or not .
and I had no chance to talk to Phyllis .
you were watching her like a hawk , Keyes .
I couldn &apos;t even phone her because I was afraid you had the wires tapped .
Monday morning there was a note on my desk that you wanted to see me , Keyes .
for a minute I wondered if it could be about Lola .
it was worse .
outside your door was the last guy in the world I wanted to see .
come in . come in , Walter .
- Hello , Keyes . - I want to ask you something .
after all the years we &apos;ve known each other ... do you mind if I make a rather blunt statement ?
- About what ? - About me .
- Walter , I &apos;m a very great man . - Yeah ?
this Dietrichson business , it &apos;s murder ... and murders don &apos;t come any neater .
as fancy a piece of homicide as anybody ever ran into ... smart , tricky , almost perfect , but ...
I think Papa has it all figured out .
figured out and wrapped up in tissue paper with pink ribbons on it .
- Go ahead . I &apos;m listening . - You know what ?
that guy Dietrichson was never on the train .
- He wasn &apos;t ? - No , he wasn &apos;t .
now look , Walter .
you can &apos;t be sure of killing a man ... by throwing him off a train that &apos;s going 15 miles an hour .
the only way you can be sure is to kill him first ... and then throw his body on the tracks .
now that would mean either killing him on the train ... or , and this is where it really gets fancy , you kill him somewhere else ... and put him on the tracks .
two possibilities , and I personally buy the second .
you &apos;re way ahead of me , Keyes .
well , look , Walter , it was like this .
they killed the guy , the wife and a somebody else ... and the somebody else took the crutches and went on the train as Dietrichson ... then the somebody else jumped off ... then they put the body on the tracks where the train had passed .
an impersonation , see ? a cinch to work .
because it was night , very few people were about ... they have the crutches to stare at ... they never really looked at the man at all .
fancy all right , Keyes , but maybe it &apos;s a little too fancy .
is it ? I tell you , it all fits together like a watch .
now let &apos;s see what we have in the way of proof .
the only guy who really got a good look at this supposed Dietrichson ... is sitting right outside my office .
I took the trouble to bring him down here from Oregon .
come here , Mr. Jackson . Yes , sir , Mr. Keyes .
these are fine cigars you smoke .
- Two for a quarter . - That &apos;s what I said .
well , did you study those photographs ?
Yes , indeed . I studied them thoroughly .
- Very thoroughly . - Have you made up your mind ?
mister Keyes , I &apos;m a Medford man . Medford , Oregon .
up in Medford we take our time making up our mind .
well , we &apos;re not in Medford now . we &apos;re in a hurry . let &apos;s have it .
are these photographs of the late Mr. Dietrichson ?
Yes .
- Then my answer is no . - What do you mean , no ?
I mean , this is not the man that was on the train .
will you swear to that ?
Mr. Keyes , I &apos;m a Medford man . Medford , Oregon .
if I say it , I mean it . if I mean it , of course I &apos;ll swear it .
there you are , Walter . there &apos;s your proof .
this is Mr. Neff , one of our salesmen .
pleased to meet you , Mr. Neff . pleased , indeed .
- How are you ? - Very fine , thank you .
- Never was better . - Sit down , Mr. Jackson .
just how would you describe the man you saw on the observation platform ?
well , I &apos;m pretty sure he was a younger man ... about 10 or 15 years younger than the man in these photographs .
Dietrichson was about 50 , wasn &apos;t he , Walter ?
Fifty-one , according to the policy .
the man I saw was nothing like 51 years old .
of course , it was pretty dark out on that platform .
come to think of it , he tried to keep his back towards me .
- But I &apos;m positive just the same . - Thank you , Jackson .
of course , you understand this matter is strictly confidential ?
we may need you again down here in Los Angeles , if the case comes to court .
any time you need me , I &apos;m entirely at your disposal , gentlemen .
- Expenses paid , of course . - Oh , yes . Yes .
get me Lubin , in the cashier &apos;s office .
Hello , Lubin . this is Keyes .
listen . I &apos;m sending a man named Jackson down to you with an expense account .
well , we brought him down here from Medford , Oregon in connection with ... the Dietrichson claim .
well , take care of his hotel bill , will you ?
ever been in Oregon , Mr. Neff ?
Yeah . he &apos;ll be right down .
no . never been up there .
wait a minute . you go trout fishing ?
- Maybe I saw you up Klamath Falls way . - Nope . I don &apos;t fish .
you don &apos;t go fishing , Mr. Neff . Neff . it &apos;s the name .
- There &apos;s a family of Neffs in Corvallis . - No relation .
let me see . this man &apos;s an automobile dealer in Corvallis .
- A very reputable man , too , I &apos;m told . - All right , Mr. Jackson .
suppose you go down to the cashier &apos;s office .
room 27 on the 11th floor .
he &apos;ll take care of your expense account and your ticket for the train tonight .
tonight ?
tomorrow morning would suit me better .
there &apos;s a very good osteopath in town ...
- I &apos;d like to see before I leave . - Osteopath ?
well , just don &apos;t put her on the expense account .
well , goodbye , gentlemen .
- It &apos;s been a pleasure . - Goodbye .
there it is , Walter .
it &apos;s beginning to come apart at the seams already .
murder &apos;s never perfect . always comes apart sooner or later .
and when two people are involved , it &apos;s usually sooner .
now , we know the Dietrichson dame is in it , and a somebody else .
pretty soon we &apos;ll know who that somebody else is .
he &apos;ll show . he &apos;s got to show .
sometime , somewhere , they &apos;ve got to meet .
their emotions are all kicked up .
whether it &apos;s love or hate doesn &apos;t matter .
they can &apos;t keep away from each other .
they may think it &apos;s twice as safe because there are two of them .
but it isn &apos;t twice as safe .
it &apos;s 10 times twice as dangerous .
they &apos;ve committed a murder ... and it &apos;s not like taking a trolley ride together ... where they can get off at different stops .
they &apos;re stuck with each other and they &apos;ve got to ride ... all the way to the end of the line .
and it &apos;s a one-way trip , and the last stop is the cemetery .
she put in her claim .
I &apos;m gonna throw it right back at her .
let her sue us if she dares .
I &apos;ll be ready for her and that somebody else .
they &apos;ll be digging their own graves .
Mrs. Dietrichson ? this is Jerry &apos;s Market .
we just got in a shipment of that English soap you were asking about .
will you be coming by today ? thank you , Mrs. Dietrichson .
- Hello , Walter . - Come over here .
what &apos;s the matter ? everything &apos;s the matter .
Keyes is rejecting your claim .
he &apos;s sitting back with his mouth watering , waiting for you to sue .
he wants you to sue , but you &apos;re not going to .
- What &apos;s he got to stop me ? - He &apos;s got plenty .
he &apos;s figured out how it was worked .
he knows it was somebody else on the train ... and he &apos;s dug up a witness he thinks can prove it .
prove it how ? if he rejects that claim , I have to sue .
Yeah ? and then you &apos;re in court and a lot of other things are going to come up .
like , for instance , about you and the first Mrs. Dietrichson .
what about me and the first Mrs. Dietrichson ?
the way she died .
and about that black hat you were trying on before you needed a black hat .
Lola &apos;s been telling you some of her cockeyed stories .
- She &apos;s been seeing you . - I &apos;ve been seeing her , if you want to know .
so she won &apos;t yell her head off about what she knows .
she &apos;s putting on an act for you , crying all over your shoulder , the lying--
keep her out of this . all I &apos;m telling you is we &apos;re not going to sue .
because you don &apos;t want the money anymore ... even if you could have it , because she &apos;s ... made you feel like a heel all of a sudden ?
it isn &apos;t the money anymore . it &apos;s our necks .
we &apos;re pulling out , do you understand ?
because of what Keyes can do ? you &apos;re not fooling me , Walter .
it &apos;s because of Lola , what you did to her father .
you &apos;re afraid she might find out someday and you can &apos;t take it , can you ?
I said , leave her out of this .
it &apos;s me I &apos;m talking about .
- I don &apos;t want to be left out of it . - Stop saying that .
it &apos;s just that it hasn &apos;t worked as we wanted .
- We can &apos;t go through with it , that &apos;s all .
- We have gone through with it .
the tough part is all behind us .
we just have to hold on now and not go soft inside ... stick close together the way we started out .
watch it .
I loved you , Walter , and I hated him .
but I wasn &apos;t going to do anything about it , not until I met you .
you planned the whole thing . I only wanted him dead .
and I &apos;m the one that fixed it so he was dead .
- Is that what you &apos;re telling me ? - And nobody &apos;s pulling out .
we went into this together , we &apos;re coming out at the end together .
it &apos;s straight down the line for both of us , remember ?
Yes , I remembered .
just like I remembered what you had told me , Keyes ... about that trolley car ride ... and how there was no getting off till the end of the line where the cemetery was .
and then I got to thinking what cemeteries are for .
they &apos;re to put dead people in .
I guess that was the first time I ever thought about Phyllis that way .
dead , I mean .
and how it would be if she were dead .
I saw Lola three or four times that week .
one night we went up into the hills behind the Hollywood Bowl .
I guess it sounds crazy , Keyes , but it was only with her that ...
I could relax and let go a little .
why are you crying ?
not gonna tell me , huh ?
of course I will , Walter . I wouldn &apos;t tell anybody else but you .
- It &apos;s about Nino . - Zachetti ? what about him ?
they killed my father together . he and Phyllis .
he helped her do it . I know he did .
what makes you say that ?
I &apos;ve been following him .
he &apos;s been to her house , night after night .
it was Phyllis and him all along .
maybe he was just going with me as a blind .
and the night of the murder--
you promised me you weren &apos;t gonna talk like this anymore .
he was supposed to pick me up after a lecture at UCLA .
but he never showed up . he said he was sick .
sick !
he couldn &apos;t show up , because the train was leaving with my father on it .
maybe I &apos;m just crazy . maybe it &apos;s all in my mind .
sure , it &apos;s all in your mind .
I only wish it were , Walter , &apos; cause I still love him .
Zachetti . Phyllis and Zachetti .
what was he doing up at her house ?
I couldn &apos;t figure that one out .
I tried to make sense out of it and got nowhere .
but the real braintwister came the next day .
you sprang it on me , Keyes , after office hours , when you caught me ... down in the lobby of the building .
Walter . Walter , just a minute .
- Hello , Keyes . - Just hang on to your hat , Walter .
- What for ? - Oh , nothing much .
that Dietrichson case just busted wide open .
- How do you mean ? - The guy showed . that &apos;s how .
- What guy ? - The guy who helped her do it .
the somebody else ?
- No kidding ? - Yeah . she just filed suit against us .
it &apos;s okay by me .
when we get them in that courtroom , I &apos;ll tear them to pieces , both of them .
- Come on . I &apos;ll buy you a martini , Walter . - No thanks , Keyes .
with two olives .
no , I &apos;ve got to get a shave and a shoeshine . I &apos;ve got a date .
Margie . I still bet she drinks from the bottle .
they give you matches when you buy cigars , you know .
all you have to do is ask for them .
don &apos;t like them , they always explode in my pocket .
I was scared stiff , Keyes .
maybe you were playing cat- and-mouse with me .
maybe you knew all along I was the somebody else .
I had to find out , and I knew where to look . in your office .
memo to Mr. Norton .
confidential . Dietrichson file .
with regard to your proposal to put Walter Neff under surveillance ...
I disagree absolutely .
I have investigated his movements on the night of the crime ... and he &apos;s definitely placed in his apartment from 7 : 15 p.m. on .
in addition to this , I have known Neff intimately for 11 years ... and I personally vouch for him without reservation .
furthermore , no connection whatsoever has been established ... between Walter Neff and Mrs. Phyllis Dietrichson ... whereas I am now able to report that such a connection has been established ... between her and another man .
this man has been observed to visit Mrs. Dietrichson ... on the nights of July 9th , 10th , 11th , 12th and 13th .
we have succeeded in identifying him as one Nino Zachetti ... former medical student , age of 28 ... residing at Lilac Court Apartments ... 1228 1 / 2 North La Brea Avenue .
we have checked Zachetti &apos;s movements on the night of the crime ... and have found that they cannot be accounted for .
I am preparing a more detailed report for your consideration .
it is my belief that we already have sufficient evidence against Zachetti ... and Mrs. Dietrichson to justify police action .
I strongly urge that this whole matter be turned over to the office ... of the district attorney .
Respectfully , Barton Keyes .
Phyllis ? it &apos;s Walter . I &apos;ve got to see you .
Yes , it has to be tonight .
how &apos;s 11 : 00 ?
don &apos;t worry about Keyes .
just leave the front door unlocked and put the lights out .
no , nobody &apos;s watching the house . not anymore .
it &apos;s just for the neighbors . I told you not to worry about Keyes .
I &apos;ll see you at 11 : 00 . Yeah .
Goodbye , baby .
I guess I don &apos;t have to tell you ... what I intended to do at 11 : 00 , Keyes .
for the first time , I saw a way to get clear of the whole mess I was in ... and of Phyllis , too , all at the same time .
Yeah , that &apos;s what I thought .
what I didn &apos;t know was that she had plans of her own .
in here , Walter .
Hello , baby .
- Anybody else in the house ? - Nobody . why ?
- What &apos;s that music ? - A radio up the street .
just like the first time I came here , isn &apos;t it ?
we were talking about automobile insurance .
only you were thinking about murder .
I was thinking about that anklet .
and what are you thinking about now ?
I &apos;m all through thinking , baby .
- I just came to say goodbye . - Goodbye ?
- Where are you going ? - You &apos;re the one that &apos;s going , baby . not me .
I &apos;m getting off the trolley car right at this corner .
suppose you stop being fancy . let &apos;s have it , whatever it is .
all right , I &apos;ll tell you . a friend of mine &apos;s got a funny theory .
he says when two people commit a murder , it &apos;s sort of like they &apos;re riding ... on a trolley oar together .
one can &apos;t get off without the other .
they &apos;re stuck with each other and they have to go on ... riding together clear to the end of the line .
and the last stop is the cemetery .
- Maybe he &apos;s got something there . - You bet he has .
two people are gonna ride to the end of the line , all right .
only I &apos;m not gonna be one of them .
I &apos;ve got another guy to finish my ride for me .
- Just who are you talking about ? - An acquaintance of yours .
a Mr. Zachetti .
come on , baby , I just got into this thing ... because I happen to know a little something about insurance , didn &apos;t I ?
I was a sucker .
I &apos;d have been brushed off just as soon as you got your hands on the money .
- Nobody wanted to brush you off . - Save it . I &apos;m telling this .
it &apos;s been you and that Zachetti guy all along , hasn &apos;t it ?
that &apos;s not true .
doesn &apos;t make any difference if it &apos;s true or not .
the point is , Keyes believes Zachetti is the one he &apos;s been looking for .
he &apos;ll have him in that gas chamber before he knows what &apos;s happened to him .
- What &apos;s happening to me all this time ? - Don &apos;t be silly , baby .
what do you think is gonna happen to you ?
you helped him do the murder , didn &apos;t you ?
that &apos;s what Keyes thinks .
and what &apos;s good enough for Keyes is good enough for me .
maybe it &apos;s not good enough for me , Walter .
maybe I don &apos;t go for the idea .
maybe I &apos;d rather talk .
sometimes people are where they can &apos;t talk .
under six feet of dirt , maybe .
and if it was you , they &apos;d charge that up to Zachetti , too , wouldn &apos;t they ?
sure they would , and that &apos;s just what &apos;s gonna happen , baby .
&apos;Cause he &apos;s coming here tonight , in about 15 minutes .
with the cops right behind him . it &apos;s all taken care of .
that would make everything lovely for you , wouldn &apos;t it ?
right .
and it &apos;s got to be done before that suit of yours comes to trial ... and Lola gets a chance to sound off ... before they trip you up on the stand , and you start to go in drag me down with you .
maybe I had Zachetti here so they won &apos;t get a chance to trip me up ... so we can get the money and be together .
- That &apos;s cute . say it again .
- He came here first to ask where Lola was .
I made him come back . I was working on him .
he &apos;s a crazy sort of guy , quick-tempered .
I kept hammering into him that she was with another man ... so he &apos;d go into one of his jealous rages , and then I &apos;d tell him where she was .
and you know what he would &apos;ve done to her , don &apos;t you , Walter ?
Yeah , and for once I believe you , because it &apos;s just rotten enough .
we &apos;re both rotten .
only you &apos;re a little more rotten .
you got me to take care of your husband for you ... and then you got Zachetti to take care of Lola , maybe take care of me , too .
then somebody else would have come along to take care of Zachetti for you .
- That &apos;s the way you operate , isn &apos;t it , baby ? - Suppose it is .
is what you &apos;ve got cooked up for tonight any better ?
I don &apos;t like that music anymore . mind if I close the window ?
you can do better than that , can &apos;t you , baby ?
better try it again .
maybe if I came a little closer ?
how &apos;s this ? think you can do it now ?
why didn &apos;t you shoot again , baby ?
don &apos;t tell me it &apos;s because you &apos;ve been in love with me all this time .
no , I never loved you , Walter , not you or anybody else .
I &apos;m rotten to the heart . I used you , just as you said .
that &apos;s all you ever meant to me ... until a minute ago ... when I couldn &apos;t fire that second shot .
I never thought that could happen to me .
sorry , baby . I &apos;m not buying . I &apos;m not asking you to buy .
just hold me close .
Goodbye , baby .
Zach em .
come here .
I said , come here .
- My name is Neff . - Yeah , and I still don &apos;t like it .
what do you want ?
look , kid .
I want to give you a present . this nice new nickel .
- What &apos;s the gag ?
- Suppose you go on back down the hill ... to the drugstore and make a phone call .
keep your nickel and buy yourself an ice-cream cone .
the number is Granite-0-3-8-6 .
ask for Miss Dietrichson . first name is Lola .
she isn &apos;t worth a nickel .
if I ever talk to her , it &apos;s not going to be over any telephone .
tough , aren &apos;t you ?
here , take the nickel and call her . she wants you to .
she doesn &apos;t want any part of me .
I know who told you that . it &apos;s not true .
Lola &apos;s in love with you . she always has been .
don &apos;t ask me why . I couldn &apos;t even guess .
here . Granite-0-3-8-6 . now go on and call her .
go on . that way .
it &apos;s almost 4 : 30 now , Keyes .
it &apos;s cold .
I wonder if she &apos;s still lying alone up there in that house .
or if they &apos;ve found her by now .
I wonder a lot of things . they don &apos;t matter anymore .
except I want you to do a favor for me , Keyes .
I want you to be the one to tell Lola , kind of gently , before it breaks wide open .
and I want you to take care of her and that guy Zachetti ... so he doesn &apos;t get pushed around too much .
Hello , Keyes .
up pretty early , aren &apos;t you ?
I always wondered what time you got down to the office .
or did that little man of yours pull you out of bed ?
the janitor did .
seems you leaked a little blood on the way in here .
Yeah .
wouldn &apos;t be surprised .
I wanted to straighten you out on that Dietrichson case .
so I gather .
- How long have you been standing there ? - Long enough .
kind of a crazy story with a crazy twist to it .
one you didn &apos;t quite figure out .
you can &apos;t figure them all , Walter .
that &apos;s right . I guess you can &apos;t at that .
now I suppose I get the big speech ... the one with all the two-dollar words in it .
let &apos;s have it , Keyes .
Walter , you &apos;re all washed up .
thanks , Keyes . that was short anyway .
I &apos;m gonna call for a doctor .
what for ? so they can patch me up ?
so they can nurse me along till I get back on my feet ?
so I can walk into that gas chamber up at San Quentin on my own power ?
is that it , Keyes ?
something like that .
- I &apos;ve got a different idea . - Yeah ?
look , Keyes .
suppose you went back to bed and didn &apos;t find these cylinders ... till tomorrow morning , when the office opens ...
after that you can play it any way you like .
would you do that much for me , Keyes ?
- Give me one good reason .
- I need four hours to get where I &apos;m going .
- You &apos;re not going anywhere , Walter . - You bet I am .
- I &apos;m going across the border . - You haven &apos;t got a chance , Walter .
good enough to try for .
- You &apos;ll never make the border . - That &apos;s what you think .
just watch me .
you &apos;ll never even make the elevator .
so long , Keyes .
Hello ... send an ambulance to the Pacific Building on Olive Street .
Yeah . it &apos;s a police job .
how you doing , Walter ? fine .
only somebody moved the elevator a couple of miles away .
they &apos;re on the way .
you know why you couldn &apos;t figure this one , Keyes ?
I &apos;ll tell you .
because the guy you were looking for was too close .
he was right across the desk from you .
closer than that , Walter .
I love you , too .
the Fire Tong Bowl
a Cheerful Film by Heinrich Spoerl
Starring Heinz Rühmann
this film is in praise of schools but it is possible that the schools will not recognize it as such .
and now gentlemen , let us pay our respects .
today I buried our dear old &quot; Pavian &quot; .
let us not remember all that was humorous .
actually his name was Schmitz and he was our Latin teacher .
he nourished us with Horace and Caesar , and we put blasting caps under his podium .
now he has rest from his bad boys .
we toast his memory .
Yes , to all of our old teachers .
Yes , and when you think about it ...
I remember we had a very young P.E. teacher .
when we wanted to irritate him ...
we reversed and changed everything that old Otto Bock had set up .
an interesting question at this point : why do people do this kind of thing ?
why do people play these kinds of jokes on their teachers ?
because it is so incredibly funny .
no , no . just the opposite .
but it &apos;s only funny , when you are the one playing the pranks .
living day in and day out with such boys like us ... would make you a little crazy .
well they probably all are a little bit crazy .
our school principal raised chickens right next to the school courtyard .
we used to feed them bread .
and we would first dip the bread in Schnapps !
they acted quite like humans do .
one of them tried to sing and the others all became sentimental .
but the chicken became obtrusive and relieved himself in a tin can .
at any rate we had the opportunity to witness the stupefying effects of the alcohol ...
well , in this sense ...
we raise our glasses and drink to ... our school .
... and to our teachers .
cheers ! gone but not forgotten .
Hello Doctor .
well now , the men seem to be quite animated this evening .
doctor , I believe they are telling jokes .
Pfeiffer , come on over here .
the premiere lasted a long time .
how was the show ?
I &apos;m glad that I was not the writer .
what kind of brew is that ?
we just got started .
Feuerzangenbowle .
the devil &apos;s infernal brew . it works something terrible on your mind .
not for me .
and it gives you a hell of a hangover .
is it the same for you , that you sometimes dream about your school days ?
no .
we all do that .
I always have the same dream :
I &apos;m sitting together with my boy in a school desk .
I have forgotten everything , and the rascal has to give me all the answers .
I always dream that I have forgotten my history book .
especially on nights when I &apos;ve eaten lobster .
history book ?
I &apos;ve never owned one .
I never had enough money .
I spent my money drinking !
Pfeiffer , come on now and laugh .
about what ? you are beyond help .
we need to get the next batch ready .
good night . thank you very much .
if you put worn down chalk in ink then it foams and you have ...
we had a teacher once who was a real dandy ..
he was also near sighted . so with him we ...
you know what we did with him ?
well come on , tell us ! a wet sponge ..
we put a wet sponge on his podium chair.Now , imagine this ... the whole morning he sat there in his wet pants .
and do the teachers all find this funny ?
we never asked them . didn &apos;t you do things like this too ?
no . so this was some kind of model institution ?
I never went to a school .
but you ...
I received my diploma through private tutors .
I was taught by private teachers in my home by the generosity of my father .
what ? you were never in a school ?
no .
well that is just terrible . you poor , pitiful man .
then you don &apos;t know how it is .
living in a real flop house and cramming for exams ..
with your fellow students . I can imagine .
imagine ? Oh no ...
you have to actually experience it .
you really missed something .
I really feel sorry for him .
he missed the most wonderful part of being young .
God knows he did .
and it can &apos;t be repeated . cheers Pfeiffer .
cheers Pfeiffer .
why couldn &apos;t he go back to school ?
what do you mean ? you mean he could really go back again ...
just for fun and only for a couple of weeks .
as a grown man ? come on , that &apos;s crazy Of course it &apos;s crazy .
although when you think about it purely in a theoretical sense ...
Yes . you are serious ?
I &apos;m not sure .
I would have to seriously think about it .
it would have to be somewhere where no one knows him . that is easy .
Babenberg for example . that is my hometown and it is in the middle of nowhere .
a charming little town ... with a charming little high school .
... and very charming ...
girls ?
no , Teachers .
is there at least a decent hotel where he can stay ?
hotel , no way ! he &apos;ll have to find a room . Yes , of course , where he can do whatever he wants .
but his sweet Marion will never allow him to do it .
I won &apos;t ask her . what ? do you really want to ?
God knows I have more important things toNdo .
if you would permit me , your publisher ... to say something .
here recently you have been writing a little too much .
it is high time that you experience something .
right !
something completely crazy .
so that you can learn to laugh .
so , what &apos;ll it be Pfeiffer ?
what could possibly happen to him ?
if things got to boring for him he could just stand and say : &quot; you can &apos;t do anything to me .
I &apos;ve got my diploma and my PhD in my briefcase . ! &quot;
well , Pfeiffer is going back to high school .
Yes , well , if you would allow me ...
nothing is allowed here .
... until I have expressed how I feel .
when are you leaving ?
I envy you . damn it , I &apos;d like to go too .
man , I would kill for the chance .
then it is clear to all of us that this is of course insane ...
but Ihave always wished , to do something a little insane .
to be a regular boy .
foolish and no worries .
to do homework , and to shoot paper wads ,
but Gentlemen , nobody would believe me .
I certainly don &apos;t look like a young pupil .
you &apos;ll have to change your appearance accordingly . how ?
should I perhaps shave off my dear beard ?
and have my flowing , thick hair trimmed ?
maybe also a pair of sad , nickel plated eyeglasses ?
books under my arm , a pupil &apos;s cap on my head .
and then I &apos;ll stand ... one morning out on the schoolyard ...
I &apos;m the new guy , the sensation for Babenberg .
and they are all coming up to me in droves ... amazed by me , questioning me ... who I am , where I come from , whether I ...
that &apos;s the new guy . he looks like ...
is he supposed to be from Berlin ?
but you &apos;re here .
how clever !
you &apos;re supposed to take a seat .
Yes sir .
take off your cap and stand up .
on behalf of this institution ... and the upper school , I welcome you .
now , sit up front so you can see better .
you will feel right at home here .
your name is ?
Doct ... uhh ... Jo ...
Johann Pfeiffer .
with one &quot; f &quot; ?
with three .
three &quot; f &apos;s &quot; ?
one in front of the &quot; ei &quot; , and two after it , sir .
so you have never been in a school ?
you gave me that impression .
you will get used to our strict school routine .
have a seat . Yes sir .
being in school is like taking medicine , it has to taste bad or it doesn &apos;t work .
as I have written in my own book :
&quot; the duty of a teacher taking into consideration the institution of higher learning &apos; ... taking into consideration , the institution of higher learning ... is primarily that he has done his part , to further scientific endeavors ... and to see that the prescribed teaching material
has been taught .
first and foremost by the knowledge and the assistance of the teacher to the students , which have been entrusted to him .
and secondly with the utmost respect and highest admiration from the students for their teacher .
who did that
Professor , why don &apos;t you ask Luck ?
did you see who shot this paper wad ?
who me ? Rosen !
did you see him do it ?
I just said you should ask Luck , because he is so smart ..
sit down , Rosen .
you have no moral maturity . if the culprit does not identify himself ,
I will find out who he is .
Ohhh , this piece of paper has been torn out of a notebook .
show me all of your notebooks .
for the next hour repeat what we have gone through .
Klemm , what do you need ?
Pfeiffer is supposed to go to the principal right away .
sir .
come closer , Pfeiffer . Yes sir . you have learned the school rules , Pfeiffer ?
they were given to me .
so you know that pupils are not to visit pubs ... without a chaperone ?
and still you were seen just yesterday ..
in the pub &quot; Axmacher &quot; . I live there .
you live there !
this is starting out well .
I thought ... You &apos;re not supposed to think .
I will break the habit .
Axmacher &quot; is a ...
he is thinking again .
I thought that if such noisy , fine gentlemen such as ...
he is still thinking .
excuse me , I ...
just be quiet .
I don &apos;t mean to say anything against the &quot; Axmacher &quot; , but that is no place for you to live .
first of all it &apos;s too costly for you und secondly , what kind of impression does that make ?
you , a pupil at a reputable institution of higher learning . I didn &apos;t think about that .
but you are supposed to think .
... as an educated person . ok .
then today I &apos;ll go looking for a new pad . a pad ? what kind of expression is that ?
a pad is something , well , nasty .
I would almost say uhh , immoral .
a student at a reputable institution of higher learning ... should not have a pad but rather a proper room , with proper , well intentioned people .
fine , then later I &apos;ll go ... o !
right now .
you are excused from your lessons .
Oh , too bad .
I don &apos;t know whether or not this might be a little bit expensive for you ... 65 Marks a week room and board ,
I can afford it .
per month , young man . what is there to eat ?
good home cooking of course .
it is substantial and nutritious .
and as much as you want .
I &apos;m not a big eater .
it &apos;s necessary for children ... in the developing years .
my son also didn &apos;t want to eat properly until ... until later , when he ...
excuse me , where is the bathroom ?
bathroom ? Oh , yes .
I have a cast iron tub .
if you would like to see it sometime ... o , thank you .
every Saturday I &apos;ll heat you up some food .
you should feel at home here .
I could have a rocking chair set up for you here. or maybe my piano .
thank you very much .
you didn &apos;t do this very well .
that could have broken . Oh , that is definitely your mother ?
no , no that is ...
well then it is some other relative ?
maybe an aunt ?
something like that .
beautiful woman ... and so elegant .
does she look after you ? I have to count on it .
where is Doctor Pfeiffer ?
not here again ?
doctor Pfeiffer is on vacation somewhere , as has already been mentioned several times .
Alfred , you are lying .
he would have taken me with him .
perhaps this time he had a special reason , for traveling without his dear ...
reasons ?
be honest .
who is she , what &apos;s her name and is she cute ?
who ? the other woman .
he didn &apos;t take a woman with him this time .
well then he must still be here.I smell cigarette smoke .
I can hardly imagine that .
here is a glass that has been used . how could that be ?
Alfred , what is going on with you ?
you &apos;re just standing there .
well , you &apos;re drunk ! something is not right here .
all of his suitcases are still here ?
and all of his suits ?
he didn &apos;t even take a pair of pajamas ? the poor man .
how will he sleep ?
telephone . sweetheart !
will you please get it ?
hmmm Ohhh .
well ...
Damned invention .
Mr. Hans , is everything OK with you ? no .
what would you like to have for breakfast ?
in the morning I really require very little .
just a little something .
if the cocoa is not sweet enough for you ...
it &apos;s fine , it &apos;s fine .
how do you like it here in Babenberg ? have you settled in well ?
Yes , yes , of course .
have you been to the Marksmen &apos;s Festival ?
well , what I really wanted to say was ...
don &apos;t get involved with any girls .
after all we live here in a city .
many a boy has been corrupted .
don &apos;t let me disturb you .
my son was also so diligent .
now he works with taxes . Oh well , things could be worse I guess .
do you have strict teachers ? hmmm . very strict
morning boys .
morning , Professor .
Oh , so you are the new one ? you don &apos;t need to stand up .
I don &apos;t require the students to stand for me .
what does it benifit me if everyone stands up ? morning , Pömmel .
I said &apos; morning &apos; , didn &apos;t I ?
Oh , you know , this weather today , the sun is shining ...
I &apos;m in such a good mood .
we really don &apos;t want to get off on the wrong foot today .
so , where were we ?
today we &apos;re talking about a steam engine .
what is a steam engine ?
to put it quite simply a steam engine ... is a large , round , black chamber .
and the large , round , black chamber , it has two holes .
the one hole is where the steam comes in ... and the other hole ... well , we &apos;ll get to that later .
Ow , what does the steam do ?
the steam , it pushes on the pistons .
what is a piston ? well , that can &apos;t be explained .
it &apos;s in the book .
what are you doing down there , Rudi ?
10 Pfennig of mine fell down here .
that is a lot of money for a boy . where was I ? right , yes , the pistons .
now that is very ingenious .
this is also where the steam comes in from the other side .
and that also pushes on the pistons ...
with it . you pig .
what will you give me for the &quot; Mecklenburg &quot; ?
have you doubled it ? but it &apos;s not genuine .
show me .
on one end it goes back and forth , and on the other end it goes around .
that is the connecting rod .
sometimes this kind of steam engine has two cylinders .
then it &apos;s called a twin engine .
any questions ?
so , now you all know how a steam engine works .
and if you don &apos;t know , it &apos;s your own fault .
where is my other shoe ?
it was just right here . and now it &apos;s gone .
maybe you have it on .
has one of you seen my other shoe ?
when I catch the lousy student , who took my shoe !
Professor , we are not stealing any shoes .
just be nice and give me my shoe back .
if you do , there will be no punishment . I am not going to give in to you .
you can check our desks .
if you had some kind of idea that I was going to hop to my next class ..
on one leg ... I have time .
Professor , the second bell ...
without my shoe I &apos;m not going anywhere .
but we have history with Doctor Brett right now .
I can &apos;t change that .
anything special out there ?
our sister high school .
isn &apos;t that convenient . can you get together with any of them ?
the blonde with the long locks .
I like the dark headed one . she is hot .
no , she &apos;s mine I like the tall one .
what about you ?
I like all of them .
you little pig .
Brett !
your attention please !
good morning . good morning .
what &apos;s going on ?
Pömmel .
Pömmel .
my dear colleague , this must be a mistake .
I &apos;m waiting for my shoe .
what is going on here ?
Oh , Rudi , yes .
... and no tickling please . Yes , thank you .
thanks very much .
have a nice morning , sir .
here you go . thank you , Ackerman .
Gees ! what a horrible character you all have .
Pfeiffer . I know .
with three &quot; f &apos;s &quot; Only because Mr. &quot; Nose &quot; asked me in such a funny way .
Mr. &quot; Nose &quot; ?
I couldn &apos;t have known that ... Professor Kray is his real name .
you see , Pfeiffer , things are different in my class .
I take care of my pupils . and I give them the choice :
war or peace .
this class has decided for peace , and it is going quite well that way .
other than that it is really of no use , because I already know all of the stupid things you might try from my own childhood .
so , it &apos;s not going to work with me .
but what if we do something brand new ?
then try it .
you were supposed to look over the chapter on mass migration .
so , Knebel !
tell us about it . which tribe of people could you best speak about ?
the , uhh ... Goths .
then I don &apos;t need to ask you about the Goths .
then tell us something about the ...
the Goths were located originally ...
originally the Goths were located in ...
Knebel , step away from your desk .
originally the Goths were located in ...
Sweden . right . then from there they went to ... ?
from there they went to uhh , near Danzig .
from there they went to to Russia and from there they went to ...
Yes , and after that they really didn &apos;t know what they should do and uhhh and they found themselves in the east where the mixed with the Western Goths .
good , Knebel .
you can have a seat . &quot; d &quot; . how could that answer possibly be a &quot; D &quot; ?
I earned a &quot; B &quot; .
Pfeiffer gets the &quot; B &quot; . and please give me your mirror .
here you go . you call that new ?
what do you do when it rains ?
the Spring time loves the playing of a flute , and the playing of the trumpet .

the Spring blows in good cheer ..
Reliably every year ...
the Spring time loves the playing of a flute , ... of the ...
tru- tru- trumpet .
someone is singing off key .
everything is OK here . Pfeiffer !
are you the one singing off key ?
uhh ... definitely not .
you &apos;re singing too deep .
Ahhhhhh ...
now it &apos;s too high .
Ahhhh ... Ahhhhhhhhhh ...
you &apos;re obviously tone deaf . you are of course excused from the chorus .
uhhh .. so I &apos;m not allowed to sing anymore ?
let &apos;s try it again .
the Spring time loves the playing of a flute , and the playing of the trumpet
it blows in good cheer ...
Reliably every year ...
the Spring time loves the playing of a flute , and the playing of the trumpet
Reliably every year ... I think it steals your heart .
this proud melancholy of language .
heavenly . magical .
and he is so intelligent . you can actually have a conversation with him .
to whom are you saying that ?
he was with me for breakfast yesterday .
you are so lucky . Pfeiffer has been missing from Berlin without a trace for two weeks now .
- Ladies , please move along .
- Oh , it is such an experience to read his work .
read ?
Oh yes , I guess one could do that sometime .
you see , that is him :
Pfeiffer , as he loves and lives . elegant , beautiful , thoughtful ... and so alluring .
well , can &apos;t everyone do that ?
when ?
the key word is Baldrian .
what ? Baldrian .
who says that ?
I do of course .
when I say the word &quot; Baldrian &quot; , things start to happen .
careful , the old men are coming ...
Pfeiffer seems to have settled in very well with us here .
I &apos;m afraid perhaps too well .
sir , do you still have class with the Upper School today ? Yes , why ?
I would advise you to be on guard .
if we don &apos;t bother the boys then they don &apos;t bother us .
- Do you agree with me ?
- Yes , but they live for such things .
the affection of our pupils can be won by other means .
I have a few effective tricks , with which you can spice up ... your lessons and present it in a pleasant way .
ln chemistry for instance ,
I talk every year about the effects of alcohol .
so every year I bring - and my students know this - ... a one liter bottle of huckleberry wine , which I have made myself , and I bring it with me to the chemistry lesson , so that each of the students
can be convinced of its pleasant taste .
careful now !
each of you just get a small swallow , otherwise it will go to your head .
each of you must hold the glass at a 20 degree angle ,
so the wine in a different position .
we will determine the alcohol content while we are doing this .
as you can see it is almost 13 percent .
I picked the huckleberries myself .
huckleberry wine not only has a pronounced and spiced taste ,
but it is also healthy and very nourishing .
isn &apos;t it right to say , Professor , Baldrian ...
Baldrian ... is supposed to be healthy as well .
of course Baldrian is healthy .
but that discussion is for some other time .
you &apos;re right , Professor .
my uncle always used to say , Baldrian ,
Baldrian belongs in every family .
you &apos;re silly .
Ackermann , what do you know about the effects of alcohol ?
even the old Germanic tribes were making a strong drink from honey called Meade .
without their meast they used to lie around on bear skins .
what &apos;s wrong ?
nothing , I just feel a little funny in the head .
then have a seat .
Pfeiffer , please carry on .
the alcohol content , or rather the content of the alcohol produces alcohol , alcohol produces content , or the so called alcohol content .
Pfeiffer , you are rambling .
sit down .
the alcohol is starting to ramble , and the result is the secret brood or the huckleberry hooch .
luck .
Professor , I don &apos;t what this means but ...
I just can &apos;t talk anymore .
what ? when alco-hole , is the only hole ...
what ?
-Sure , I feel fine ...
Rosen !
that is laughable .
but Professor ,
I only have to think about my poor mother .
the wine ferments far away ...
the alcohol , the wine , the alcohol is produced by the hucleberries in fermentation , in fermented alcohol ...
Professor , I &apos;m seeing everything in double .
Professor I &apos;m going to bed .
I don &apos;t understand this .
all of this from just one little swallow . this is just im ... impossible
I would like to have a little swallow !
what is going on here ?
quiet !
quiet !
I want to know what is going on here .
you little , you sweet .
Yes , we drank some wine , some really good wine . come here , sit down on the bench .
Ackermann ! what have you been drinking ?
as good Germans we have been drinking good German wine .
and where do all of you get this wine from ? we had to drink it in Professor Kay &apos;s class .
I am completely puzzled .
if you would just try one swallow ... I don &apos;t drink .
all of you , go home , as quietly as you can .
try to pull yourselves together . and then go straight to bed .
my dear colleague , you have poisoned the entire Upper School .
but I innocently wanted to show the effects of alcohol ...
my wonderful Upper School ... from such a small swallow ?
... poisoned I said . I am expecting a written report from you .
and furthermore there will be ...
what , Pfeiffer ?
ls someone there ?
no . you ? are you the guy with the huckleberry wine ?
what do you want ?
we just want to take a look .
ok , ok now , go on . you ?
you &apos;re supposed to be so smart .
so tell us something smart .
or would you rather have a cigarette ? but you &apos;re not allowed to smoke .
it &apos;s forbidden in detention .
but we can smoke in front of you .
now he &apos;s going to get detention for smoking .
you &apos;re only being brave because there is a door between us .
should we come in ?
I &apos;d like for you to .
we &apos;re embarassing ourselves . what do you think of us ?
you are all probably ugly like the night ... bowlegged simpletons , nothing up top and nothing in the rear .
nice to meet you , Pfeiffer .
you &apos;re just children !
Oh my , oh my , oh my ...
Mrs. Windscheid , do you think it will work like this ?
people don &apos;t like it when boys , become so vain all of the sudden .
I &apos;ll be back for dinner .
Hi , Hans .
Hi , See you , Good Bye .
where are you off to ?
well , uhhh ...
what about the essay ? I have to go . Bye .
hiking is the miller &apos;s desire
hiking is the miller &apos;s desire
hiking
that must be a bad miller who never thought of hiking who never thought of hiking
so tell me , was it awful in detention ?
quite the opposite . it was a highly interesting experience .
Pfeiffer , why do you tell me so little about yourself ?
what is there to tell ?
what would you like to know ? everything .
have you ever been in love before ?
I have always been very stand offish .
you see , that is one of the things I like about you .
I don &apos;t like boys who are immediately so pushy .
the younger students are the worst .
really ? my girlfriend knew one , who wanted a kiss from her .
what is it ?
too bad that I &apos;m not a younger student .
due TO RENOVATIONS THE HIGH SCHOOL WILL BE CLOSED TODAY .
you there ! what are you doing ?
nothing .
you took down that sign .
no I didn &apos;t .
hang it right back up there . what do you want me to do ?
gentlemen , I am asking for your opinion .
I agree with the opinion of the director .
but I haven &apos;t said anything yet .
my dear colleague .
I vote that the students responsible be expelled from this school .
but first we have to determine who the guilty student is .
we will appeal to their sense of duty , and ask them to tell us ... willingly who did this .
I believe in our students but ... so much sense of duty ?
usually it is a good friend who turns the perpetrator in .
hopefully we don &apos;t have friends like this at our school .
if we don &apos;t get anywhere then we &apos;ll have to punish them all , the old fashioned way .
we have 247 students at our school . we &apos;ll be punishing 246 of them unjustly .
ln my book &quot; the duty of a teacher ... &quot;
my dear Mr. Brandt , please wipe the smile off of your face .
the situation is serious enough .
true , but the problem lies somewhere else .
if it were to come out that this sign was a forgery , and that we all fell for this stupid trick played on us by the boys , we will be the laughing stock of the town .
and what will the school superintendent say ?
for God &apos;s sake , what are going to do ?
nothing !
what do you mean &quot; nothing &quot; ?
this forgery ... Whether the sign is a forgery or not depends completely on us .
to put it simply we &apos;ll just say :
the sign is real .
because of the renovations .
gentlemen ! gentlemen !
this suggestion stands in the starkest contrast ... to the principles in my book and I vote against it .
I for one apologize for this suggestion .
we have the highest reputation and respect in this community and for our school to be found at fault ...
Yes , at fault for not avoiding the blame .
and you Principal , of all people can avoid an extremely embarrassing report to the school superintendent .
uh ... hmmm ...
you mean , Mr. Pömmel , I need to ...
Yes , how do you see things working out ? we don &apos;t have any renovations going on .
kids , the meeting is over .
now the investigation begins .
well , Pfeiffer , you think you &apos;re so brave , or maybe I should say , brave with your words .
are your knees knocking a little ?
if it were to come out that ... How ?
I don &apos;t know .
maybe , if someone were to turn you in .
maybe you ? we can &apos;t trust you ?
say that again and I will turn him in .
you bet I would !
have a seat .
turn to page ...
now what do you want ?
I have to make an announcement .
if you &apos;re not prepared again ... I believe it to be my duty , so that no innocent person ...
take care of this out on the school yard .
Professor , it &apos;s got to do with the sign .
sit down .
it &apos;s got to do with the sign yesterday .
not , &quot; it &apos;s got to do with the sign &quot; , but rather , &quot; it has to do with the sign . &quot;
ok , OK , has to do , got to do with ... It has to do with the sign ...
you need to sit down !
aren &apos;t you interested in ...
if you continue you will be thrown out of this class ! who hung the sign outside ...
you &apos;re talking nonsense .
the maintenance crew placed the sign on the gate because of the renovations .
that &apos;s a lie . that will be enough !
sit down ! Ackermann , write this up in the class book :
Rosen disturbed the lesson with his foolish talk .
now open your books to page 117 .
ok , Pfeiffer , You look so pleased with yourself .
maybe I should pick on you again today ?
I hope you do .
then I want to see rather or not you understood &quot; Wallenstein &quot; .
ln which act and in which scene ... does who say to whom these words : &quot; that was no act of heroism Octavio . &quot;
Yes , Pfeiffer , you don &apos;t know , do you ?
you are becoming the laughing stock of the entire class .
I don &apos;t get it. ln all other subjects you are doing satisfactorily or better ...
you are only failing German .
German ...
German is not my thing . that is too bad !
what do you hope to be someday ? I don &apos;t know yet .
be sure and choose a profession that doesn &apos;t require much writing .
good Morning .
may I help you ? you would like a room ?
I would like to know if , Dr. Pfeiffer lives here . he hasn &apos;t checked in yet . in the meantime would you like to ...
thank you .
where else could Dr. Pfeiffer live ?
Oh my , maybe ... But I ...
Mr. Axmacher , we did have a Mr. Pfeiffer here .
the one who left the huge tip .
Oh please , there is no way !
a huge tip !
where does he live ? ask over at the high school .
high School ?
they are on their break right now .
mam , are you lost ?
I am looking for a Doctor Pfeiffer , I have to urgently speak with him .
doctor Pfeiffer , no , who is that ?
a teacher ? I &apos;m not sure .
mam , unless you mean him ?
he came to us a couple of weeks ago .
but he is no doctor .
could you call him in ?
thank you very much .
good morning boys .
we are taking a quiz today over air pressure .
couldn &apos;t we just write about a thermometer ?
we would do better at that . I don &apos;t care .
write over whatever you want . just no nonsense .
somebody knocked .
... anyway , about the thermometer .
Professor , someone really is knocking .
go and see what they want .
I &apos;ll ask .
there is a woman out there .
what does she want ?
to come in .
no , no , no .
how does she look ? beautiful . I &apos;ll go and look for myself .
please behave yourselves for just a moment .
could you tell me if there is a Mr. Pfeiffer in your class ?
do you mean this boy here ?
I would like to speak with him .
well , we &apos;re taking a quiz right now .
now Professor , don &apos;t be so strict .
send him out here .
if it won &apos;t take too long .
whom shall I say is here ?
he can see for himself .
Yes , and what is this regarding ?
that doesn &apos;t make any difference . then I &apos;m not interested in helping you .
Professor !
he is a bit unruly and not very well behaved ...
what ? him ?
Oh ...
he keeps us all in stitches .
where exactly do you know him from ?
from Berlin of course . I see . you &apos;re from Berlin .
Yes , you look like you are from Berlin . you know what ?
Hans , are you here ?
he must have just left .
in the afternoons he is always going somewhere .
can I get something for you ?
Oh , now I know who you are .
you are his aunt .
Yes , I know you from the picture hanging over there which he hung over there .
did you write him that you were coming ?
sometimes it &apos;s better to arrive unannounced . a surprise .
I &apos;m sure he will be thrilled .
no , how young you look .
Yes , dear woman ...
we notice how old we are becoming by our children .
so how is my .... my nephew doing ?
great , he has become a lovely young man .
Oh , well then he certainly has a little girlfriend by now ?
no !
Oh , here he comes .
we &apos;ll be wanting some cheesecake .
just wait .
Pfeiffer , we can &apos;t tell you that you can &apos;t be here , but don &apos;t you think it is a bit unusual that you are sitting here at the table next to us ...
Oh , well if I could sit with all of you .
of course I &apos;d like to .
I just didn &apos;t think it would be proper .
would you please introduce to me both of these ladies ?
no ? nice to meet you , Pfeiffer .
nice to meet you . Pfeiffer . the principal was so kind as to invite me over .
well , do I really get to sit next to these precious young ladies ?
mam , I don &apos;t know if you have already heard about me .
I am extraordinarily pleased , to find out that you are the charming wife ... of our highly esteemed principal .
Oh , thank you . I am even more astounded to see how ..
similar you and your sister look .
but no , Mr. Pfeiffer , this is my little daughter .
you don &apos;t say ! what do you know ?
that just can &apos;t be the truth .
you already have such a grown up daughter ?
I thought that this young woman was ... What did you think ?
... would be your daughter .
you overestimate my age . I &apos;m not that old .
Yes , Professor , you &apos;re right . I didn &apos;t think it through . at the very most you are twice as old as Miss Eva .
but don &apos;t worry .
in 20 years it will be a completely different mix .
you will only be 1 1 / 2 times as old , and in 100 years you will be ...
let me do the math ...
Pfeiffer , if you have anything else something else for today ... anything ... if you were to have anything else planned ...
well of course he has to finish his homework .
we &apos;ll do that in school tomorrow morning .
of course he &apos;s not here anymore .
but we can &apos;t do our Greek ... Come on , Greek ?
I &apos;m sure he &apos;s got some cigarettes tucked away here somewhere .
what the heck is this ?
it &apos;s a hair bow . absolutely . you have to treat women poorly .
first I will marry ...
because you have to .
your girlfriend colors her hair blonde .
can you do that ?
with bleach , H2-O2 .
this is why I don &apos;t get chemistry .
of course there are no cigarettes . Whoah , what in the world is this ?
would you two gentlemen perhaps like a cigarette from me ?
you are allowed to smoke , aren &apos;t you ?
who is that ? don &apos;t know .
I &apos;m sure she &apos;s waiting on Hans .
you think so ?
not bad at all .
- Introduce me .
- We can &apos;t do this . - Go on ! - We can &apos;t do this .
you &apos;re going to introduce me and ...
gentlemen ! let &apos;s not fight .
but next time you had better knock , when a lady is sleeping in the room .
you both could very easily put me in a compromising situation . - Yes , of course .
- Excuse us . - Please excuse us .
you also don &apos;t need to think about running away ,
just turn around .
and since you both are acting so cute ,
I will allow you to put my shoes on for me .
Ouch ... but gentlemen ...
well they didn &apos;t have any more streusel so I got us some ...
Ohh ... Marion ... ?
well , it &apos;s amazing that you still know my name .
Yes , quite amazing .
so nice that you have come .
may I introduce my friends to you ?
man , this is my aunt . go on , go !
well .
well now , there you are .
Yes , here I am .
it &apos;s so nice of you to come . you &apos;ve said that three times .
three times . fine , then you can start .
of course you know that your big part is coming up in this comedy we are playing out here .
you &apos;ll ask me whether or not I am crazy .
I will ignore your question as if it is unworthy of a response .
the you will prove to me , that this whole thing is an outrageous farce and that a person can not become a child again , just by putting a pupil &apos;s cap on their head .
then you will make it all too clear that in reality this is an escape , from the world , from you , and even from myself .
that all of my opportunities in Berlin are fading away , that my premiere is in danger and my publisher , and the minister of culture are upset and so on and so on ...
all quite true .
but then I will answer you ... in very brief fashion ; in fact , in only one sentence :
I feel pretty damn comfortable here .
that is not the job of a poet .
you said that quite beautifully .
and you &apos;ve gotten really fat too .
I &apos;ve gotten younger . for Christmas you can give me a novel about the Wild West .
and for Easter a basket of candy .
you &apos;re acting so silly .
at any rate I have completely botched your big scene .
in my private life , I have other means .
&quot; may has arrived &quot;
do we have to walk past this place ?
this is not just a place , this is my school .
you &apos;ll have to allow me to enjoy this one last farewell look .
Ohh , see this gate here ?
there were so many mornings that I came waltzing through here , mostly with a bad conscience , and without my Latin .
in the afternoons I would stroll back out , my stomach full of hunger and my head full of nonsense .
can we move on please ?
when did the Western Goths conquer the ...
you hear that up there , on the corner ? that &apos;s us .
we just had history with Doctor Brett , Na great guy .
actually they are all great guys come to think of it .
Hey , we have a little break right now .
come on .
Ohhh . Marion , I just had a wonderful idea .
come on !
the &quot; nose &quot; !
you have been studying the great German poets .
luck , go to the board and write down their names and the dates they lived . write big and clearly .
you have plenty of room .
where are you coming from so late ... Oh !
it &apos;s nothing .
just a bit of a bad toothache .
here is my written excuse if you want to see it .
wh- wh- why aren &apos;t you staying at home ?
well Professor , here I have more diversions .
that &apos;s just great .
now , sit down ... carefully .
all of you could learn from Pfeiffer &apos;s example .
how far have you gotten , Luck ?
why aren &apos;t you writing anymore ?
maybe I should erase this ?
go and get the principal .
I have to say , I am very disappointed .
to see this disgusting example of classroom disruption ... in my school .
I &apos;m disappointed in all of you .
I want to give the guilty student the opportunity , to voluntarily turn himself in .
not here in front of the class .
he &apos;ll have to come to my room .
what do you want , Pfeiffer ?
well , Principal , you might get angry but I think the picture is really nice .
Pfeiffer !
a young girl , probably from a proper family ... and without any clothes on .
this is no girl . it is supposed to be a boy .
we &apos;re just not quite done with it yet .
Yes ... in fact , I thought the same thing myself .
but at any rate , I think it is extraordinarily nice ... that this embarrassing incident has come to such an innocent resolution .
Ackermann , erase the board .
where did we stop yesterday in our reading of &quot; Don Carlos &quot; ?
fourth act . let &apos;s read on with separate roles .
who would like to take the part of the noble Marquis Posa ?
Rosen is the right man for that role .
Hosemann , you take the role of Princess Eboli .
for God &apos;s sake , leave me ...
what did he say to you , you unfortunate one ?
nothing . leave me alone , nothing .
how much do you know ? there is no escape for you now .
you will not tell anyone else about this in this lifetime . good God , what do you mean by that ?
you don &apos;t want to ..... kill me ?
ln fact I do . I &apos;ll make it quick .
Oh , dear and eternal mercy .
what error have I committed ?
if you don &apos;t mind ?
Pfeiffer , you can &apos;t stay focused .
what is this ?
it &apos;s a letter from a friend . then let &apos;s read it :
&quot; look for me at the usual time and at the usual place . &quot;
a thousand kisses ... ?
Exclamation point .
signed : &quot; big E ? period &quot; .
who is that ?
but this has nothing to do with school . - Who is &quot; E Period &quot; ?
then I &apos;ll have the principal determine whose handwriting this is .
Professor , may I just , for one second ... Thank you .
we &apos;ll talk more about this .
I &apos;ll expect you in my apartment at 3 o &apos;clock .
Pfeiffer , once again you are late .
I asked for you to come at 3 o &apos;clock .
it is just now 3 .
it is two minutes past four . couldn &apos;t it be that your watch is wrong ?
Oh , no it &apos;s not possible . I &apos;ll prove it to you . you see ... ?
I don &apos;t understand this .
I &apos;ll have to get this repaired .
I &apos;m afraid I treated you unjustly . have a seat .
so , let &apos;s get to the reason for your visit .
so , who is this &quot; Big E Period &quot; ?
- Or do you not wish to tell me ? - Nein .
very admirable , but it will not help you .
I have already found out another way .
I know you &apos;re going to be extremely angry with me and I know I &apos;ll probably fail my final exams ... I am never angry with my students .
that goes against my principles , which I have written about in my book , &quot; the duty of a teacher ... &quot;
Yes , well , then can I go ?
one moment .
you may well be an average student , but in spite of that you may be a very admirable human being .
you havec caught the eye of and turned the head of an inexperienced young lady .
you will no doubt destroy any possibilty there might have been ... for you to have a secure and well-to-do life .
are you ready to take the responsibility for that ? well , I &apos;ll have to think about it .
I have another appointment . Oh !
thank you very much . good bye .
poor Eva .
tell me really quickly , what are you thinking about ?
I &apos;m not quite done with my thoughts just yet .
are you afraid that you &apos;ll fail your final exam ?
there won &apos;t be any chance for that .
- How is that ? - I &apos;m leaving . probably pretty soon .
that &apos;s terrible . and what about me ? I &apos;m taking you with me .
Oh , please tell me . just how do you think that will happen ?
quite nicely . as my wife of course .
Oh Hans , you shouldn &apos;t joke about such things with me .
I love you so terribly and I think you love me too , but we &apos;re both still going to school and we shouldn &apos;t be thinking about such things .
I &apos;ll be happy to wait for you .
we are old enough . you &apos;re not so bright .
what can you do without a diploma ? come on , let &apos;s think about it , OK ?
maybe an author .
you don &apos;t need a diploma , you don &apos;t have to go to college and you can earn money rather quickly .
you don &apos;t really think so ?
by the way , do you know my famous namesake , the famous author , Johannes Pfeiffer ?
the one with the &quot; Novel of the Week &quot; ?
but Hans , I would not compare you to him . he is a real poet .
you could say that . that is wonderful .
we were together quite a lot in Berlin .
I know a few things about him . but Hans , now you &apos;re just bragging .
have you actually ever seen him ?
what does he look like ? Oh , pretty nice looking .
he &apos;s built a little like me , His hair is a little bit longer and the glasses ...
you &apos;ll have to imagine me without glasses .
this goof wears only a monocle . Yes , and that face ... How can I describe it , Eva ?
if you really want to know ... ... then just look at me .
then you &apos;ll know how he looks
what an imagination you have .
not only do I look uncannily like this highly talented poet , but rather , in fact , I am he .
what is that supposed to mean ? just what I said .
I am Johannes Pfeiffer . three weeks ago I won the Literature Award .
my new comedy is playing at the Royal Playhouse .
hold on . first you know him well , then you want to look like him ... now you say you are him .
you &apos;re too much today .
seriously Eva , I swear to you .
if you want to try an fool me , fine ... but don &apos;t swear or invoke your word of honor .
I can show you my identification . Ican introduce you to a woman from Berlin ...
fine then , if you want to .
you don &apos;t need to get all upset .
you have to believe me , trust me and marry me .
but if you still believe that , I am nothing more than a poor student ... then ... then ...
- then ?
- then then someone else can have you . give me my coat please .
here you are .
have you done your geometry yet ? Nope .
did you ?
Hey , here comes Hans .
Hey , Hans , what &apos;s up ?
why the long face ?
- Doesn &apos;t matter . - Wasn &apos;t she nice to you ?
stop talking like that . have you done the geometry ?
no , I &apos;m leaving tomorrow .
where to ? back to Berlin .
you &apos;re just going to leave ?
tomorrow I &apos;m going to turn in my resignation .
good night .
Yes , what is it ? it &apos;s already 8 o &apos;clock .
no , it was 7 some time ago . for goodness sake !
this is the fault of that disrespectful snit ...
- Look out !
the &quot; nose &quot; is coming ! - Oh , the &quot; nose &quot; ...
he &apos;ll be coming a little bit later today .
as far as I &apos;m concerned he can stay at home ...
don &apos;t talk like that .
girls have ruined me .
you already have one .
should I get the girls to come over here ?
- What ? - How ?
right . follow me .
what ?
that &apos;s just ... He &apos;s gone crazy .
Hey you , come here .
run on over to the girls school .
tell the principal that our principal says hello .
and then tell her the following :
&quot; teachers ONLY &quot;
is it OK that we &apos;re here ?
it &apos;s always OK for you to be here .
so what do we do now ? I don &apos;t know .
what should I say ?
where is the man with the Radio ?
the man who is going to show us the radio .
I mean the radium .
radium ? Oh yes , him !
don &apos;t you have a teacher ?
Pfeiffer said that the &quot; nose &quot; won &apos;t be here today ...
where is Pfeiffer ? he &apos;s not here today .
you &apos;re burning my mouth .
sit down please .
you should all have a seat .
ladies , I thank you for such a joyous reception , and I believe , that I am liked better by you than by my own students .
unfortunately today I am running late , and according to the principles of my often mentioned book : &quot; the rights of a teacher ... taking into consideration the institution of higher learning ... &quot;
must not differ from those which exist for the students .
Ackermann , write this down in the class book :
Professor &quot; Nose &quot; will receive one hour detention ... because of his unexcused tardiness .
we will be very brief .
Professor Kray has been chosen for a position as principal in another school .
superintendent , that will be just fine . in fact Professor Kray has chemistry right now with his Upper School class .
if you would like to go and sit in ... I would like to .
what are you doing ?
don &apos;t you want to come and see ?
take it easy .
just because the superintendent is here ...
you know , Kray is to be envied for this principal &apos;s position , in spite of his sometimes unique teaching methods .
now , your methods are also sometimes unique .
so don &apos;t you want to let your old colleague know ... which methods , in your opinion ... are the correct methods ?
- Mine .
- Aha . when is exactly a method correct ?
- When the teacher becomes the friend of his pupils ?
... and the pupils respect him .
unfortunately no .
this new age has new methods .
Yes , you young teachers always want to make things better ... and you will !
I &apos;m too old for any new methods .
dear Pömmel
- Excuse me , Professor ...
Oh please , just call me Pömmel .
young trees have to be bound , so they can grow properly , and so that they don &apos;t sprout and bloom in every direction .
and that is just how it is with young people .
discipline has to be the tie that binds them .
so that they grow to a beautiful maturity .
don &apos;t you worry , that your trees will grow right up into the sky ? no , never .
life takes care of that .
have you noticed that too ?
radium ... radium is a divalent element which has the property of being luminescent in the dark .
you were just making a little joke ?
carry on with the lesson .
please carry on .
Pfeiffer , for heaven &apos;s sake .
please keep up this charade .
don &apos;t worry .
you won &apos;t be punished . I give you my word .
please , please . so , now where were we ?
the chemistry of farm soil .
Friedrich the Great had already recognized the problem .
it is from him that we have the saying :
&quot; he who makes it possible for two stalks to grow , where there was previously only one is greater than the greatest military general . &quot;
another example : again , it was a German , who through his scientific research , laid the foundation for ... our modern day agricultural chemistry .
we can call him the father of fertilizer .
he studied in Giessen , he discovered chlorinated chloroform , created new techniques for analysis .
he has become more well known because his name has been associated with a popular meat extract .
so , what is this chemist &apos;s name ? Maggi !
I mean Liebig .
where did these young girls come from ?
the girls , well , yes ... This is the Upper School class of the girl &apos;s school next door .
Ohhh , you are experimenting with a co-educational system .
please keep me informed of your results .
teacher , very , very nice .
please , carry on .
nice . very good , Ackermann.A- / B + .
have a seat .
Pfeiffer , carry on .
where is he hiding himself ? he is absent .
pity . too bad , too bad .
superintendent .
I would have so much liked to have introduced you to the biggest hooligan in our school .
I thought his lesson was just excellent , very fresh and original .
we can go now .
you disrespectful jerk !
let him through . I &apos;ll kick you out of this class .
Ackermann , call the police ! luck , call the fire department !
principal , you see now ! pardon me gentlemen .
I have a question .
I am , Superintendent .
it &apos;s obvious . I am , Superintendent , because I was here earlier .
it &apos;s probably better if we just let the gentlemen work this out .
principal , let me know when I can come back .
I &apos;ll be expecting your report .
principal , we can make this short and sweet .
you won &apos;t have to say one unfriendly word .
you will want to throw me out .
I agree that you should . I worked it out this way .
I &apos;ve earned it , I planned on it .
No. no Pfeiffer . it is much worse than that .
I can &apos;t do anything to you . I can &apos;t punish you in any way .
you mean I can &apos;t leave yet ? what does someone have to do to get kicked out of this school ?
a murder ?
... or lead your daughter astray ?
Yes , Hans , you can !
I &apos;ll stand by your side whether you have a diploma or not .
Oh Papa , we want to become authors .
- Then you &apos;ll both starve . - It doesn &apos;t matter We &apos;ll get through it , won &apos;t we , Hans .
I &apos;ve done it .
I &apos;m leaving and I get to keep my Eva .
me , the pupil , Hans Pfeiffer . by the way , I almost forgot :
if he really is the author , then maybe he &apos;ll write a novel about us .
maybe an unseemly film ?
gentlemen , it &apos;s already been done . but don &apos;t worry .
I have exaggerated everything so much , that nobody will be recognizable .
besides , a high school like the one you have here with teachers like you , and with students like us doesn &apos;t even exist .
I confess publically , that I made up the entire story from A-Z , the school , the principal , the teachers and even little Eva .
Yes , I even made up my own part . the only true part of the entire story is the beginning :
stand back .
no , Paula . don &apos;t look back .
you &apos;ve got to forget everything that &apos;s happened here .
that &apos;s why you &apos;re going to Italy , to Signor Guardi .
he was the best friend your aunt ever had , and he &apos;ll be yours , too .
perhaps Signor Guardi will make you into a great singer , as she was .
wouldn &apos;t you like that ?
you must think of the future , dear , not the past .
no . now , look . wait a moment , signorina .
there &apos;s no use . Paula , you are not concentrating .
your mind &apos;s not on your singing .
all these years you &apos;ve worked so hard . now what &apos;s come over you ?
this opera is tragedy , signorina . you seem incapable of understanding .
did you never hear your aunt sing Lucia ?
you look like her .
but I don &apos;t sing like her . I know .
Signor Guardi , may I speak to you seriously ?
- Very seriously .
- Maestro .
it is 10 minutes to the hour .
if you &apos;re not continuing the lesson , I &apos;d like to be excused .
- Very well , Signor Anton .
- Thank you . good afternoon , signorina .
now , what is it you wish to say to me seriously ?
&quot; very seriously . &quot;
Signor Guardi , I &apos;ve tried .
I &apos;ve worked hard , but it &apos;s no use .
- I haven &apos;t the voice , have I ?
- The trouble is not in your voice alone .
your heart is not in your singing anymore .
each time you come here now , you look happier and you sing worse .
tell me , Paula , you &apos;re in love ?
it &apos;s something that has never happened to me before ... something I never expected would happen ... but suddenly it is as if nothing else existed ... even my music , which used to mean so much to me .
Yes , you are right . my thoughts were wandering while singing just now .
I &apos;m too happy .
that &apos;s why you said ... the tragedy was something I could never understand .
it was cruel of me to say that ... cruel and untrue .
real tragedy has touched your life ... and very deeply .
but now there is a chance to forget tragedy , my child .
take it . free yourself from the past ... and forget your singing , too , for a while .
happiness is better than art .
dear Maestro , no one has ever been as kind to me as you have since she died .
will you let me meet the man who is taking my pupil away from me ?
Yes , of course .
you have a rendezvous with him .
the moment your lesson is over , you fly to him .
is he jealous of your music , these hours you spend away from him ?
dear Maestro ...
I don &apos;t know when we &apos;ll meet again .
thank you .
- Did you tell him ?
- He told me . he didn &apos;t know who .
- What did he say ?
- He said I should take my happiness .
and will you ? now ? why do you still hesitate , Paula ?
but I don &apos;t know you . I don &apos;t know anything about you .
nor I about you , but I want to marry you .
- Are you afraid ?
- I think I am , a little .
- Of me ?
- No .
no , never , but of happiness .
I haven &apos;t had a lot , and I feel I can &apos;t trust it .
you must give me time to get used to the idea .
you shall have all the time you want . I &apos;ve waited for you so long .
waited ? we &apos;ve only known each other two weeks .
I &apos;ve waited all my life till now . I can wait a little longer .
but it will not be easy to wait , to be patient , seeing you every day .
no , it won &apos;t be easy for me , either .
- I should go away .
- Go away ?
by myself for a week , only a week ... just to know what I &apos;m doing , just to be sure .
- Where will you go ?
- I thought perhaps to the Lakes .
- And when will you go ?
- I thought tomorrow .
- Tomorrow ?
- Is that too soon ?
no , the sooner you go , the sooner you will come back .
but while you &apos;re away , never forget for one moment I &apos;m here waiting ... and in love with you .
my dearest .
Oh , my goodness ! good gracious !
- It &apos;s so exciting .
- Your book ?
Yes . it &apos;s about a girl who marries a man , and what do you think ?
- He &apos;s got six wives buried in the cellar .
- That seems a lot .
Yes , and I &apos;m only on Page 200 , so I &apos;m sure there &apos;s still more to come .
- It &apos;s a wonderful book .
- It sounds a little gruesome .
Yes . I &apos;m afraid I enjoy a good murder now and then .
my brother always calls me &quot; Bloodthirsty Bessie . &quot;
- Have a biscuit , dear .
- Thank you .
Digestive biscuits . unpleasant name , isn &apos;t it ?
I always call them &quot; diggy biscuits . &quot;
I never travel without them .
- You &apos;re not English , are you ?
- No .
I was brought up there . my aunt lived in London .
- Are you on your way there now ?
- No . I &apos;m going to Lake Como .
- All by yourself ?
- Yes , all by myself .
- But is that wise ?
- I don &apos;t think any harm will come to me .
I &apos;m going to London . I must be in London for the spring .
the crocuses , you know , and the daffodils and the tulips .
the gardens are so beautiful in the spring .
I say &quot; good morning &quot; to my flowers in Thornton Square every day .
- Thornton Square ?
- Yes . that &apos;s where I live , Number 16 .
do you know it ?
- I know Thornton Square .
- Do you know anyone living there ?
- I used to . not anymore .
- I wonder who that could be .
I know almost everyone who lives there now .
we &apos;re all so very friendly , popping in and out of each other &apos;s houses .
- What number did your friends live at ?
- I &apos;m afraid I don &apos;t remember .
you know , we had a real , live murder there .
Yes , I &apos;d heard of it .
unfortunately , it &apos;s before I went to live there , just a year before .
ten years ago , at Number 9 , a famous singer called Alice Alquist .
- Have another biscuit , dear .
- No , thank you .
it was a most mysterious case . they never found out who killed her .
they never even found a motive .
I &apos;ve tried to get in the house many a time .
I think it &apos;s so exciting . don &apos;t you ? I mean , just to see .
nothing &apos;s been changed ...
- all the furniture and everything ...
- I think we &apos;re getting into Como .
so we are .
- Is anyone meeting you ?
- No .
- You will be careful , won &apos;t you ?
- I will . Goodbye .
Goodbye . come and see me if you &apos;re ever in London .
my name is Thwaites , Miss Thwaites .
I &apos;ll point out the window of the room in Number 9 where it happened .
you can see it from my drawing room .
- You &apos;re not angry with me ?
- Angry ?
if you hadn &apos;t come , I should have sent for you .
come and look at the morning .
aren &apos;t you cold like this ? what were you dreaming of ?
- Our life together .
- And how do you see it ?
I saw all the places where we &apos;ll be together .
lovely places like this .
I was thinking of our life together , too , only I heard it in music .
- Something that I want to write .
- Yes , what ?
the whole thing is alive with happiness .
I want a feeling of the early morning .
- This morning .
- Yes .
with the sun rising , lighting your hair as it is now .
I don &apos;t know how it ends .
perhaps it never ends until I do .
- When will you start on it ?
- Some day ... after we &apos;ve had our honeymoon ... and settled down in a home of our own somewhere .
- Where ?
- Where would you like us to settle ?
- I haven &apos;t thought . Paris , perhaps .
- Paris ?
or Rome ? how would you feel about London ?
London ?
Paula , if you won &apos;t laugh at me , I &apos;d like to tell you something .
I won &apos;t laugh at you . what is it ?
it &apos;s an idea , a silly idea that &apos;s been with me for years .
I was in London once in the winter .
it seemed there was no city in the world ... that was colder to the homeless ... or that could be warmer to the ones who had a home .
how I used to long for a home of my own ... in one of those quiet houses in the little London squares ... with the woman I should one day come to love .
could we settle down in London ? not in a house in a square , perhaps ...
Paula , why do you look like that ?
- Because there is a house in a square .
- What house ?
9 , Thornton Square .
- She left it to me . - She ?
you mean Alice Alquist ?
she was my mother &apos;s sister . my mother died when I was born .
I don &apos;t know anything about her or my father .
I lived with my aunt always as if I were her own .
after it happened I never went back .
that house comes into my dreams sometimes ... a house of horror .
it &apos;s strange .
I haven &apos;t dreamed of it since I &apos;ve known you .
I haven &apos;t been afraid since I &apos;ve known you .
- Afraid ?
- Yes .
for years I &apos;ve been afraid of something nameless ... ever since she died .
you &apos;ve cast out fear for me .
if it were true , it would make me very happy .
it is true . I &apos;ve found peace in loving you .
- I could even face that house with you .
- No , Paula , beloved .
- I would not ask that of you .
- Yes , you shall have your dream .
you shall have your house in a square .
good morning , daffodils . good morning , tulips .
Percy ! there it is , dear .
what are you doing , my good man ?
turning on the water in Number 9 , ma &apos;am .
nine ? why nine ?
orders , ma &apos;am .
it must be going to be occupied at last , after all these years .
wouldn &apos;t care to live in there , myself .
I don &apos;t know about living there , but I would like to get a peep inside .
- Good morning .
- Good morning .
- Are we late ? - Not at all .
I &apos;ve only been here a moment .
- Good morning , Mr. Anton .
it &apos;s you . don &apos;t you remember me ?
in the train in Italy last month . diggy biscuits .
Yes , of course , I do .
don &apos;t tell me you &apos;re coming to live in Number 9 ?
Yes .
we mustn &apos;t keep Mr. Mufflin waiting .
- Sorry , I must go now . perhaps we can ...
- I &apos;ll call directly you &apos;re settled .
that &apos;s my house over there , with the pink curtains .
Goodbye , for the present . Goodbye .
I &apos;m so glad we are to be neighbors .
so am I .
this lock needs oiling .
if there &apos;s anything further I can do , let me hear from you . good day .
- Good day .
- Good day , Mr. Anton .
now , Paula ...
- This is the dining room ?
- Yes .
there &apos;s a little study beyond it .
- And the drawing room is upstairs ?
- Yes .
come , Paula . don &apos;t stand there in the doorway .
will you light the gas , please ?
- Gregory .
- It &apos;s a very handsome room .
Yes , but to see it like this ...
I remember parties in this room when it was full of flowers and light .
those must have been wonderful days .
it &apos;s all dead in here .
the whole place seems to smell of death .
there . it will all be fresh again in a moment .
that &apos;s where she kept her treasures .
things she collected on her tours around the world .
- The glass is broken .
- It was broken that night .
all the things were disarranged , but there was nothing missing .
I know all these by heart .
it was a great treat when she &apos;d unlock them ... and take them out and tell me all their stories .
- Careful , dearest .
- She wore this glove in Romeo and juliet ... at the command performance at Covent Garden .
Gounod signed it for her afterwards .
I never knew what happened to the other glove .
I used to ask her sometimes ... but she &apos;d only laugh and say she &apos;d given it away .
a very great admirer . she would never tell me who .
I wish I could have seen her .
let me show her to you .
that &apos;s as the Empress Theodora .
that was her greatest role .
when she sang it in St. Petersburg ... the Czar used to come to every performance .
she was very beautiful , very much like you .
it was there that I found her , there in front of the fire ... under her own portrait .
I was in bed , and something woke me .
I &apos;ve never known what .
I came running down the stairs ... frightened , as if I knew what had happened .
she had been strangled .
she had been strangled . her lovely face was all ...
no , I can &apos;t stay here .
then how would it be if we took away all these things that remind you so of her ?
the painting , all this furniture . shut it away so you can &apos;t even see it ?
suppose we make it a new house with new things , beautiful things ... for a new , beautiful life for us .
Yes , and then later , we &apos;ll have people here and parties again .
- Don &apos;t you want to ?
- Later , yes , but not just at once .
let us have our honeymoon here by ourselves for a little longer .
- Yes . I only ...
- I know .
later .
now , where should we put all these things ?
there is an attic under the roof .
all her trunks are up there and all her costumes .
then we &apos;ll put all these there , too , and then we &apos;ll board it up ... so you &apos;ll never have to see it again , never even think of it .
that piano traveled with her everywhere in the great days .
it will need tuning terribly . look , here &apos;s some of her music .
her score of Theodora , just as she left it .
we &apos;ll send those upstairs with all the rest .
no , not her music .
perhaps later I might like to study again .
I &apos;d like to have her scores to study from .
- What makes you play that ?
- Why not ?
that was her great song .
she always used it in her concerts for her last encore .
it was everybody &apos;s favorite .
here &apos;s an old letter .
&quot; dear Miss Alquist , I beg of you to see me just once more .
&quot; I have followed you to London . &quot;
it was written two days before she was murdered .
- Where did you find that ?
- In this score . she must have left it there .
it was written by somebody called Sergis Bauer .
give it to me !
- Gregory , what is it ?
- I &apos;m sorry ...
I didn &apos;t mean to be so violent .
it &apos;s just that ...
why does this letter upset you so ?
it &apos;s not the letter . it &apos;s just that I am upset for you .
all these things are reminding you of her .
you said that you had lost your fears , and now everything you touch here ... brings them back .
while you are afraid of anything , there cannot be any happiness for us .
you must forget her .
no , not her .
only what happened to her .
Elizabeth ! I say ! Elizabeth !
- Good afternoon , Elizabeth .
- It &apos;s you , miss .
- Good afternoon .
- Good afternoon .
- The house is looking very nice now .
- What &apos;s that , miss ?
I said , the house looks very nice now ...
- from the outside .
- Yes , miss .
I expect you &apos;re glad you got rid of the workmen at last .
Yes , miss .
do you think that Mr. And Mrs. Anton will be ready to receive callers soon ?
I couldn &apos;t say , miss , I &apos;m sure . we haven &apos;t had no visitors yet .
master says seeing people isn &apos;t good for her .
she hasn &apos;t been feeling too well lately .
- I &apos;m sorry to hear that .
- What &apos;s that , miss ?
I said , this fine summer weather we &apos;re having ought to do her good .
Yes , miss . they &apos;re going out this afternoon .
first time for some while . good day , miss .
good day . what lovely-looking strawberries .
I never get big ones like that .
I think I &apos;ll just taste one for luck .
good afternoon .
if you have your bags , you can start immediately .
- Thank you , sir . they &apos;re downstairs , sir .
- Then everything is arranged .
- Your wages will be L16 a year . - Yes , sir . I understand all right , sir .
just one more thing ...
I don &apos;t want you to bother your mistress about anything , ever .
if you have any questions , just come to me .
Yes , sir .
that &apos;ll suit me , sir .
then you &apos;ll remember it . your predecessor did not .
that &apos;s why she left .
it may seem a little unusual ... but your mistress is inclined to be rather highly strung .
Elizabeth , come in .
this is Elizabeth , the cook .
- Hello .
- You &apos;ll find that she &apos;s a little deaf .
- Hello .
- Elizabeth , this is our new housemaid .
I was explaining her duties to her . she &apos;ll be down in a moment .
very good , sir . I &apos;ll see you downstairs .
- She &apos;s a tartar , ain &apos;t she ?
- What do you mean by that ?
you know , strict-like .
I &apos;m not gonna sleep in the same room with her .
you see the way she looked at me ?
don &apos;t you think perhaps your costume might have something to do with it ?
- What &apos;s the matter with it ?
- It &apos;s a little , shall we say , loud ?
- I hope you &apos;re not a flighty girl , Lucy .
- My name &apos;s Nancy , sir .
I &apos;m sorry , Nancy . are you ?
- I don &apos;t think so , sir .
- I &apos;m glad to hear that .
your mistress is very particular about everything being very correct .
- Is she , sir ?
- Yes .
so am I .
this is our new housemaid .
- How do you do ?
- I &apos;m all right , ma &apos;am .
- You can go now , Nancy .
- Very good , sir .
she seems a nice girl .
I &apos;m glad . I hope I haven &apos;t kept you waiting .
- I had to go back for the guidebook .
- You look like a summer &apos;s day .
because I &apos;m happy .
we &apos;re going out , and I &apos;m going to show you London .
- Do you know what day today is ?
- Yes .
three months ago today ... we came out of that little church by the lake , man and wife .
I have a present for you , Paula .
where did you find anything so beautiful ?
it belonged to my mother , and before that to her mother ... and now it belongs to you .
I shall wear it always .
always , my dear .
how sweet of you to give me this .
I &apos;m afraid the pin is not very strong .
- No .
- I &apos;ll have it mended .
you better not wear it until I have .
you might lose it . you know , you are inclined to lose things .
- I am ? I didn &apos;t realize that .
- Just little things .
I &apos;ll put it in your bag for safekeeping .
there .
now , you &apos;ll remember where it is .
- Don &apos;t be silly . of course I &apos;ll remember .
- I was teasing you , my dear .
- That &apos;s London .
- It &apos;s music .
- Good afternoon .
- Good afternoon , ma &apos;am .
it &apos;s nice to see you getting out again .
- Where to , ma &apos;am ?
- The Tower of London .
very good , ma &apos;am . the Tower of London it is .
what &apos;s the matter with the mistress ? she don &apos;t look ill to me . is she ?
I don &apos;t know . not as I can see .
but the master keeps telling her she is .
here , ladies and gentlemen , we have the ax of the headsman ... and the execution block .
these are the originals with which such historic persons as Lady Jane Grey ... and Queen Catherine Howard was beheaded within these precincts .
the victim , kneeling , laid his head upon the block ... fitted his neck into the small , hollowed-out space ... designed to receive it , whereupon the ax descended ... severing the head from the torso with one blow ... or in unlucky cases , two .
moving to our right , we have a model of the famous rack ... the instrument of torture upon which prisoners were stretched ... their limbs being frequently torn from their sockets ... in an effort to extract a confession from them , true or false .
there you are . I wondered what had become of you .
it was so close in there . let &apos;s go out into the sunshine .
- Are we going to see the torture chamber ?
- Certainly . I think it &apos;s right over here .
Uncle Brian , what &apos;s the matter ? you look as if you &apos;ve seen a ghost .
- That &apos;s exactly what I thought I &apos;d seen .
- There &apos;s no such thing as a ghost .
I know . I meant I just thought I saw someone I know is dead .
I have no idea who he is . he seemed to know me and ...
do you usually bow to people you don &apos;t know ?
no . I supposed I &apos;d met him somewhere .
- Are you telling me the truth ?
- Of course . why should I lie ?
- I don &apos;t know who he is .
- Yet you smiled at him . why ?
I tell you , I wasn &apos;t thinking .
I don &apos;t know why I did it .
like the other things .
- What other things ?
- Nothing .
only I &apos;ve been noticing , Paula , that ...
- you &apos;ve been forgetful lately .
- Forgetful ?
losing things and ...
don &apos;t look so worried , Paula . it &apos;s nothing .
- You get tired and ...
- Yes , that &apos;s probably what it is . I get tired .
- I &apos;m tired now . can &apos;t we go home ?
- No , we still have the crown jewels to see .
- They &apos;re in that building over there .
- How do you know ?
what did you say ?
how do you know where they are ? you haven &apos;t been here before .
the guide told us inside .
are you becoming suspicious as well as absent-minded , Paula ?
no , of course not , Gregory .
the Kohinoor or &quot; Mountain of Light . &quot;
it &apos;s the most famous diamond in the world .
&quot; the imperial state crown ...
- That &apos;s that one .
- Yes , I know .
&quot; ... was made for the coronation of Queen Victoria .
&quot; among the jewels it contains are the ruby of the Black Prince ...
&quot; the size of a hen &apos;s egg , the Stuart sapphire ...
&quot; which was among the jewels ... &quot; James II took with him when he fled to France ...
&quot; and the diamonds and pearls from the earrings of Queen Elizabeth . &quot;
jewels are wonderful things .
they have a life of their own .
Gregory , can &apos;t we go home now ?
of course , my dear . I &apos;ll take you home .
that &apos;s the mistress &apos;s room . that &apos;s the master &apos;s .
we &apos;ve got all this to see to . have you got the sheets there ?
I could have sworn that there were more than that , but ...
- What &apos;s up there ?
- Never mind about up there .
- The whole floor &apos;s been boarded off .
- Why ?
that &apos;s the way the master wanted it .
you were right .
there is nothing more beautiful than London in sunshine .
I &apos;m sorry I spoiled the day by bringing you home so soon .
you should lie down and rest for a little , Paula .
should I stay with you and not go out this evening ?
no . you go and work as usual .
can you really work in that room you rented ?
I wish you &apos;d let me see it and make it attractive .
I never notice my surroundings when I &apos;m working .
you might give me your broach so I can have it repaired .
what &apos;s the matter ? anything wrong ?
I can &apos;t find it .
what ?
I missed it when we were in the Tower .
I must turn everything out .
I know it was here . I can &apos;t understand it .
I couldn &apos;t have lost it . it must be here .
I &apos;m sure it &apos;s there .
it &apos;s not .
Paula , didn &apos;t I tell you ? how did you come to lose it ?
I must have pulled it out with something , I suppose .
- I &apos;m terribly sorry . please forgive me .
- Forgive , my dear ?
it &apos;s not as serious as that . it &apos;s not valuable .
your present to me , your mother &apos;s broach . I wanted to wear it always .
I don &apos;t remember opening my bag . I suppose I must have .
you did put it in there ?
don &apos;t you even remember that ?
Yes , of course I do .
but suddenly , I am beginning not to trust my memory at all .
I tell you , you &apos;re just tired , that &apos;s all .
it doesn &apos;t mean anything . I &apos;m sure it doesn &apos;t .
don &apos;t worry so , Paula . don &apos;t worry .
- Nancy , has the master left ?
- Yes , ma &apos;am . a little while ago .
please see that he has plenty of coal on the fire in his room .
you already told me that , ma &apos;am .
Nancy , did you turn the gas up in there ?
turn it up ? no , why ?
I thought it went down in here , as if you had .
- I never touched it .
- But this went down .
perhaps Elizabeth lit another jet in the kitchen .
couldn &apos;t have been her . she &apos;s been in bed for an hour .
I could hear her snoring .
that &apos;s odd .
- Good night , Nancy .
- Good night , ma &apos;am .
- Yes , that &apos;s it .
- I beg your pardon ?
I said , &quot; That &apos;s it . &quot; that &apos;s the Alquist house .
it happened in the drawing room , upstairs . that window .
I live just across the square . my name is Thwaites , Miss Thwaites .
- How do you do ?
- How do you do ?
perhaps you could tell me , has the house been occupied long ?
about four or five months now . come along .
you don &apos;t happen to know who &apos;s living in the house , do you ?
Yes . a foreign couple . Anton &apos;s the name .
- What do you mean , mysterious ?
- Never have visitors ... never go out anywhere .
at least , she doesn &apos;t .
I think you &apos;re wrong .
there aren &apos;t as many as usual here today . come along , pigeons .
come along , sparrows . what did you say ?
you seem to be wrong about her not going out .
how very surprising .
it &apos;s you , ma &apos;am . I never knew you &apos;d gone out .
I went for a walk , but it looks as if it might rain ...
- so I thought I should have my umbrella .
- Of course , ma &apos;am .
suppose the master comes back and asks where you &apos;ve gone ?
- Tell him I just went for a walk .
- By yourself , ma &apos;am ?
- Of course . why not ?
- Suppose the master asks where ?
tell him I just ...
now do you see what I mean ?
goes out , goes back , goes in .
odd . definitely odd .
it &apos;s an odd household , too . that maidservant , most impertinent .
I can &apos;t get a thing out of her .
she won &apos;t talk to me ... though she would quick enough if I wore trousers .
the way she carries on with that policeman on the beat .
it &apos;s scandalous !
there , that &apos;s all there is .
fly away , pigeons . more tomorrow .
well !
paper ! thank you , sir . there you are , sir .
extra . special . special edition .
here you are , governor . paper ? very good , sir .
thank you , sir .
put that file back where you got it . I tell you , the case is dead .
I &apos;m not going to have it all dug up again for nothing .
do you understand ? you had no right to go through that file .
- Budge had no right to let you get at it .
- Sorry , General .
- Mr. Cameron is your assistant ...
- Then it &apos;s his job to assist me ... not go digging into 10-year-old cases on wild suspicions of his own .
- Now then , Budge , you get along .
- Very good , General .
what &apos;s your interest in this case , anyway ?
it was rather a famous case ... and it impressed me very much at the time .
besides ...
I once met Alice Alquist .
I was taken to hear her ... at a command performance when I was 12 years old ... and afterwards to meet her in the artists &apos; room .
it sounds silly , but I still think she was the most beautiful woman ...
I ever saw , and I &apos;ve never forgotten her .
- And now ...
- You &apos;ve seen someone who looks like her .
- Living in the same house .
- Why shouldn &apos;t she ?
if she &apos;s the niece , the house probably belongs to her .
and if you &apos;re trying to meet a pretty woman ... you &apos;ve no right to use official business as an excuse .
it &apos;s not that , sir .
but I tell you , sir , I have a feeling there &apos;s something peculiar going on there .
perhaps even more than peculiar .
look here , Brian , once and for all , the case was given up as hopeless .
as for the matter of the jewels , that was dropped by order ... of a most important personage .
jewels ?
there &apos;s nothing here about jewels .
there were some jewels .
they were given to her ... by somebody very highly placed .
some of the crown jewels of his ...
- Of another country , as a matter of fact .
- What happened to them ?
- They disappeared .
- That &apos;s why she was murdered .
that was the official theory .
though what the murderer wanted the jewels for I can &apos;t imagine .
they were too famous for him to be able to sell them .
- Have they never shown up since ?
- Not as far as I know .
well then , where are they ?
I don &apos;t know . the murder part of the case was pursued to the utmost ... as you can see for yourself from that file .
there was never any case against anyone .
there were the usual blind-alley suspects .
you &apos;ve read all their names there in that stuff .
and there was never anything to prove against any of them .
now run along , there &apos;s a good fellow . I &apos;m busy .
very well , sir .
good day , sir .
- Afternoon , Mr. Cameron .
- Williams .
- Did you want me , sir ?
- Yes .
tell me , you &apos;re not a married man , are you ?
no , sir .
- Where are you on duty now ?
- Down in the East End , sir .
how would you like a more fashionable locality ?
- I &apos;d like it very much , sir .
- We &apos;ll see what can be done about it .
don &apos;t say anything to anybody for the moment .
if you want coal on the fire , Paula , why don &apos;t you ring for the maid ?
I &apos;m sorry . I didn &apos;t mean to wake you .
go back to sleep , dear .
no , Paula .
now that you have wakened me , we might as well be comfortable .
- Ring for the maid .
- I can put it on myself .
we &apos;ve had this subject out before .
please , pull the bell cord .
it seems so unnecessary .
what do you suppose the servants are for ?
answer me . what do you suppose the servants are for ?
to do things . to serve us , I suppose .
exactly .
it &apos;s only that I think we should consider them a little .
don &apos;t be cross with me .
I &apos;m not cross with you .
there are a lot of things ...
- Did you ring , sir ?
- No . your mistress rang .
go on . why don &apos;t you tell Nancy what you rang for ?
- A little coal on the fire , please , Nancy .
- Very good , madam .
you &apos;re looking very pretty this afternoon , do you know that ?
I don &apos;t know it at all , sir , I &apos;m sure .
- Tonight is your night out , isn &apos;t it ?
- That &apos;s right , sir .
whom are you meeting tonight ? you might light the gas , too , Nancy .
I see they &apos;ve changed the policeman on the beat .
is his heart going to be added to the list of those you &apos;ve broken ?
- I didn &apos;t know I &apos;d broken any , sir .
- I &apos;m sure that &apos;s not true .
and that complexion of yours ... that &apos;s something that &apos;s not quite true , either .
you do it very cleverly , I grant you .
in fact , I was wondering whether you might not care ... to pass some of your secrets on to your mistress ... and help her get rid of her pallor .
sure . I &apos;d be very pleased to do anything I can , sir .
- Will that be all you &apos;re wanting ?
- Yes , except tea when it &apos;s ready .
very good , sir .
how can you talk to Nancy like that ?
you seem so anxious to regard the servants as your equals .
I thought I would treat her as one .
besides , I was only trifling with her .
no wonder that girl despises me , the way you encourage her .
despises you ? whatever makes you think that ?
her whole manner !
the way she talks to me , the way she looks at me .
looks at you ?
I hope you &apos;re not starting to imagine things again .
- You &apos;re not , are you , Paula ?
- Of course I &apos;m not .
I hope you &apos;re not , but if you start talking about the way Nancy looks at you ...
don &apos;t turn away , Paula . we must have this out .
do you really think Nancy despises you ?
answer me , Paula . do you ?
no , Gregory .
I &apos;m glad of that . it hurts me when you &apos;re ill and fanciful .
come in .
what is it now ?
if you please , sir , Miss Thwaites is downstairs .
she wanted to know if the mistress was at home .
you mean that old busybody from across the square ?
Yes , sir . she has her nephew with her .
I don &apos;t think we need bore ourselves with them .
- Tell her your mistress is not at home .
- Gregory , really , she &apos;s been ...
my dear , if you let her in once , you &apos;ll always have her here .
but she &apos;s called so often , and we &apos;ve never been at home to her ...
I do not want people all over this house !
bringing her family with her .
you tell Miss Thwaites ... that your mistress is sorry , but she &apos;s not well enough to see her .
very good , sir .
Gregory , why did you do that ? I would &apos;ve liked to have seen her .
I thought you were only trying to be polite .
why didn &apos;t you tell me you really wanted to see her ?
I couldn &apos;t in front of that girl .
you must get over this ridiculous fear of the servants .
if you really wanted to see her , all you had to say was :
&quot; show her up , Nancy , &quot; wasn &apos;t it ?
- Yes , but ...
- I &apos;m sorry , miss . that &apos;s all I know .
the mistress isn &apos;t well enough to receive anyone .
please tell her how sorry we are .
come along , Auntie dear .
you wouldn &apos;t have had time to see them anyway .
you have to dress , do your hair .
why ?
we &apos;re going out tonight .
we are ? you didn &apos;t tell me .
or have I forgotten ?
don &apos;t you think this is charming ? it &apos;s from the new operetta at the Gaiety .
I wish I could write tunes like Strauss .
Paula , you silly child , don &apos;t look like that .
of course you haven &apos;t forgotten anything .
this is my surprise for you . we &apos;re going to the theater tonight .
how wonderful !
- And you thought I was being cruel to you .
- No , you &apos;re not cruel .
keeping people away from you , making you a prisoner .
you &apos;re the kindest man in the world .
I &apos;m sorry .
I &apos;m so happy .
what &apos;s the matter ?
Paula , I don &apos;t want to upset you .
if you will put things right ... when I &apos;m not looking , we &apos;ll assume it did not happen .
but what ? Gregory , what ?
please don &apos;t turn your back on me . what has happened ?
you mean you don &apos;t know ?
no , I ...
look .
Yes .
the little picture has been taken down .
who took it down ?
- Why has it been taken down ?
- Why indeed ?
why was it taken down before ?
get it from wherever you &apos;ve hidden it and put it back in its place .
but I haven &apos;t hidden it . I swear I haven &apos;t . why should I ?
don &apos;t look at me like that .
someone else must have done it .
no , don &apos;t ring . please don &apos;t ring .
- Don &apos;t shame me before the servants .
- Please stop being hysterical .
now sit down and calm yourself before they come .
we must get to the bottom of this once and for all .
please come in , Elizabeth .
do you notice anything missing from this room ?
missing , sir ?
no . I don &apos;t think so , sir .
look carefully on the walls .
- There &apos;s a little picture missing , sir .
- Exactly .
- Did you take it away ?
- No , sir .
have you ever taken it down from where it belongs ?
- No , sir . why ever should I ?
- Why indeed ?
you go to church , don &apos;t you ?
- To what , sir ?
- Church !
Yes , sir .
please kiss this Bible as a solemn oath that you &apos;ve told the truth .
thank you , Elizabeth . you may go now .
and send Nancy in here at once .
- Nancy .
- Yes , sir .
Gregory , no , not that girl .
I &apos;ll say anything . I &apos;ll say that I did it . I &apos;ll not have that ...
please ! have the goodness to control yourself .
this is painful enough without your making it worse .
please come back .
since you &apos;ve thrown suspicion on the servants ... they must be cleared of it .
now sit down .
did you hear what I said ?
sit down .
come here , Nancy .
a picture has been taken down from the wall there .
so it has . that &apos;s another rum go .
I did not ask for any comments on your part .
I want to know whether it was you who took the picture down .
of course it wasn &apos;t , sir . what would I want to take it down for ?
shall I ask her to kiss the Bible , Paula , or will you accept her word ?
- Of course I &apos;ll accept it . let her go .
- Very well . you may go , Nancy .
give me that Bible !
there . do you see ? I swear on the Bible I didn &apos;t take that picture down .
go look for that picture .
so you knew where it was all the time .
I didn &apos;t know .
I only looked there because that &apos;s where it was found twice before .
I didn &apos;t know , Gregory .
I didn &apos;t .
I think you better go to your room .
we &apos;re not going to the theater ?
I &apos;m afraid you are far from well enough for the theater .
now come .
- Lf it was I who took that picture down ...
- lf ?
if it was I who took it down the other times ... if I do all these senseless , meaningless things ...
it &apos;s so meaningless . why should I take a picture down ?
- Then I don &apos;t know what I do anymore .
- I know , Paula .
- That &apos;s just the trouble .
- But then , if that &apos;s true ... then you must be gentle with me .
you must bear with me , please .
please , Gregory , please .
now come , Paula .
- You better go to your room .
- What are you going to do ?
I &apos;m going out to work and forget all this .
no . please don &apos;t leave me here all by myself now .
I get so frightened when I am here alone and you go out night after night .
frightened ? you never told me that before .
I &apos;m telling you now ! I &apos;m frightened of the house !
I hear noises and footsteps .
I imagine things , that there are people over the house .
I &apos;m frightened of myself , too . Gregory , please !
please don &apos;t leave me . stay with me .
Gregory , take me in your arms , please !
please . take me in your arms , Gregory .
I hope to find you better in the morning .
she seems to be getting worse , doesn &apos;t she , sir ?
you will please not refer to your mistress as &quot; she . &quot;
thank you , Nancy .
gonna work on your tunes again tonight , sir ?
- You &apos;re always working , aren &apos;t you ?
- Yes .
what are you doing with your evening out ?
I &apos;m going to a music hall .
- I &apos;ve never been to an English music hall .
- You don &apos;t know what you &apos;ve missed , sir .
- You &apos;d like it a lot , sir .
- We must see about that .
and whom are you going to the music hall with ?
gentleman friend , sir .
now , you know , Nancy , don &apos;t you ... that gentleman friends are sometimes inclined ...
- to take liberties with young ladies ?
- No , sir , not with me .
I can take care of myself when I want to .
it strikes me that you &apos;re not at all the kind of girl that your mistress ...
- should have for a housemaid .
- No , sir ?
she &apos;s not the only one in the house , is she ?
let people find their own places for the concert .
just sit where they like .
those who don &apos;t care for music can go into the smoking room .
- May I come in ?
- Brian .
good evening .
good evening , Lady Dalroy . how are you , sir ?
- How are you , my boy ? nice to see you .
- Am I the first to arrive ?
I have a favor to ask . are you having a sit-down supper afterwards ?
Yes , and I &apos;ve put you next to Laura Pritchard .
I don &apos;t like Laura Pritchard . she &apos;s got adenoids .
nonsense . she &apos;s a most agreeable girl , and I want you to be very nice to her .
haven &apos;t you learned yet that Mildred is an incurable matchmaker ?
I &apos;ll be nice to Miss Pritchard another time .
tonight I want you to be very kind and put me next to Mrs. Anton . will you ?
- It &apos;s most tiresome of you .
all right . - Who &apos;s Mrs. Anton ?
she &apos;s the niece of Alice Alquist .
she used to come here as a child .
Brian told me she was back in London now and married ... so I invited them to come tonight .
who &apos;s Mr. Anton , by the way ?
what does he do ? where does he come from ?
put me next to her tonight , and I &apos;ll find out for you .
I &apos;m sorry , Brian , but you &apos;ll have to sit next to the Pritchard girl after all .
- The Antons can &apos;t come .
- No .
- Letter from her ?
- No . from him .
- Him ?
- Yes . apparently she &apos;s ill .
very tiresome of her . read it if you want to .
I must go and order the tables . come on , Freddy . I want you .
is that you , Paula ?
Yes .
why are you dressed up like that ?
because tonight is Lady Dalroy &apos;s reception .
but I sent a note .
I know .
I sent a note to say you were not well enough .
I &apos;m quite well enough , and I want to go .
lady Dalroy was very kind to me when I was small ... and I am going .
I must get out of this house , meet people ... and see a little of what &apos;s going on in the world .
I am going to this reception , Gregory .
then I &apos;m afraid you &apos;ll have to go alone .
then I must go alone .
I didn &apos;t realize this party meant so much to you .
I &apos;ll go and change immediately .
you didn &apos;t really think I would let you go alone , did you ?
- I don &apos;t know .
- I shan &apos;t be a minute .
come in .
coo . did you ring for something , ma &apos;am ?
- Yes . please fetch a cab .
- But I thought you were ...
get a cab , Nancy .
- Is the master going out , too ?
- Yes , he is .
- Please hurry .
- Very good , ma &apos;am .
Cabby !
Beckoning a cab on your evening out ?
Yes . I &apos;m going out to dinner at Buckingham Palace , I am .
- I &apos;m gonna have a lovely evening out .
- What &apos;s the matter with you ?
first they &apos;re going out , then they &apos;re not . changing all my plans .
never a word to me from him .
you better get along . they &apos;ll be out in a minute .
- See you Sunday ?
- Perhaps .
- Usual place ?
- Usual place .
- Good night .
- Good night .
draw your cloak around you . it &apos;s damp . Dalroy House .
- Good night , Nancy .
- Have a nice evening , sir .
you &apos;re Paula Anton . I &apos;m sure you don &apos;t remember me .
I do indeed , Lady Dalroy .
it was at the children &apos;s party here , and there was a magician .
- May I introduce my husband , Lady Dalroy .
- How do you do ?
I hope you will forgive all the confusion ... but my wife suddenly felt much better , and we were so anxious to come .
but of course . you &apos;ll find some seats over there .
Seratsky hasn &apos;t played yet . I &apos;ll see you later at supper .
- What are you looking at ?
- Nothing .
I thought I saw someone I knew , that &apos;s all .
my watch is gone .
- I didn &apos;t put it there . I swear I didn &apos;t put ...
- Would you be quiet , please ?
Paula , please control yourself .
- Being seen like this in public .
- No .
come .
I &apos;m very sorry , but I &apos;m afraid my wife &apos;s illness has returned .
- Can I send for a doctor ?
- No . if I can just get her home .
we shouldn &apos;t have come tonight , but she was so anxious .
I &apos;m so sorry , Lady Dalroy .
I think it &apos;s the most ...
I &apos;ve tried so hard to keep it within these walls , in my own house .
now , because you would go out tonight , the whole of London knows it .
if I could only get inside that brain of yours ... and understand what makes you do these crazy , twisted things .
are you trying to tell me I &apos;m insane ?
- That &apos;s what I &apos;m trying not to tell myself .
- But that &apos;s what you think , isn &apos;t it ?
that &apos;s what you &apos;ve been hinting and suggesting for months , ever since ...
- Since what ?
- Since the day I lost your broach .
Yes , that &apos;s when it all began .
no , it began before that .
the first day here , when I found that letter .
- The one I found among the music ... from that man called Bauer .
Sergis Bauer . Yes , I remember .
Yes , you &apos;re right . that &apos;s when it began .
I can see you still , standing there and saying :
&quot; look at this letter , &quot; and staring at nothing .
- What ?
- You had nothing in your hand .
what ?
I was staggered , but I didn &apos;t know then ... how much reason I had to be .
- I don &apos;t know . what reason ?
- I didn &apos;t know then about your mother .
what about my mother ?
your mother was mad .
she died in an asylum when you were a year old .
that &apos;s not true .
I &apos;ve been making inquiries about Alice Alquist &apos;s sister .
I &apos;ve talked to the doctor who attended her .
- Would you like to see him ?
he described her symptoms to me . would you like to hear them ?
it began with her imagining things , that she heard noises , footsteps , voices ... and then the voices began to speak to her .
in the end , she died in an asylum with no brain at all .
no ! please stop .
now perhaps you will understand a lot of things about yourself and me .
now perhaps you will understand why I cannot let you meet people .
he must have been rather disappointed that you left before he could talk to you .
who ?
the man who was sitting behind us .
- Where ?
- Tonight .
you only went because you knew he would be there .
what , Gregory ? who ?
the man who bowed to you that day at the Tower .
who is he , someone from the past ? someone you refused , perhaps ?
I never met him . I have no idea who he is .
who is he ? why is he dogging my footsteps ?
I don &apos;t know that he is .
- You lie . why do you lie to me ?
- I never lie to you .
I &apos;m sorry . I should not have said that .
I know you never lie to me . I believe you .
you &apos;re not lying . it &apos;s worse than lying .
you &apos;ve forgotten . you &apos;ve forgotten him as you forget everything .
but perhaps I &apos;m wrong to try to handle this myself .
the case is one for people who know about those things .
we shall have visitors , and shortly .
- A doctor ?
- Two .
I believe two is the required number .
Yes ?
it &apos;s you , Constable .
good evening , sir .
- Nasty night to be out , isn &apos;t it ?
- Very nasty , sir , indeed .
where &apos;d he go ?
he didn &apos;t get past me as I came through the alley .
he certainly turned in here . you must have missed him in the fog .
I &apos;d have heard his footsteps as he passed , Mr. Cameron .
he must &apos;ve gone into the rear of one of these houses .
Yes , but which ? and why ?
do you think he could have gone into his own house ?
- Lf he did , sir , that &apos;s not against the law .
- No , but it &apos;s against common sense .
why should he walk out of his own house and all the way around the corner ... just to get back to where he started from ?
but the service entrance to Number 9 is out front .
there &apos;s no way into Number 9 from back here .
- Then where did he go ?
- Number 5 is empty .
but what would he want to go into an empty house for ?
I don &apos;t know , Williams .
just coming , ma &apos;am .
what is it , ma &apos;am ?
- I want you to help me . I &apos;m so tired .
- Yes , ma &apos;am .
did you turn on the gas ?
did you turn on the gas anywhere downstairs just now ?
why , no , ma &apos;am . I &apos;ve had it on in the kitchen all evening , that &apos;s all .
I thought it went down in there , as if someone ... had turned it on in some other part of the house .
there &apos;s no one in the house but me , ma &apos;am . Nancy &apos;s not back yet .
but the gas comes in pipes , ma &apos;am .
and I expect they get more gas in the pipes at some times ... than they does at others .
Yes , I suppose that could explain it .
- Do you hear anything ?
- Hear anything , ma &apos;am ?
- Yes . up there . listen .
- Listen to what , ma &apos;am ?
those sounds . those noises up there .
no , ma &apos;am .
but there are sounds . sounds like someone moving about .
- Elizabeth , listen , please .
- There are no noises up there , ma &apos;am .
how could there be ? the whole floor is boarded up .
you know that as well as I do . no one can &apos;t get in up there .
you know , ma &apos;am , you just imagine things .
Williams , come in . you &apos;re early .
get another cup , will you ?
- Sit down . make yourself comfortable .
- Thank you , sir .
well ?
I don &apos;t know what it means , but this morning around 3 : 00 ...
I was standing on the corner of Thornton Square , looking both ways-like ... and suddenly , who should I see turning up , but our friend again .
- Coming out of the mews , it looked like .
- Yes ?
I got a good look at him under the lamppost .
I tell you , that man had been up to something .
what ?
I wouldn &apos;t undertake to say what exactly ... but he was kind of in a mess .
clothes untidy , tie all on one side .
dirt and dust all over , even on his face .
- Had he been in a fight ?
- He didn &apos;t look like that , sir .
more as though he &apos;d been digging in a cellar or something .
have some coffee .
thank you , sir . I &apos;ve had my breakfast already .
had it in the kitchen at Number 9 , as a matter of fact .
Nancy tell you anything this morning ?
if you ask me , Nancy &apos;s getting ideas above her station .
seems the master told her ... that her mistress might be going away for quite a long time ... and that he wanted her to stay and look after him .
the master told her her mistress might be going away ?
that &apos;s right , sir .
- A long time , you said ?
- Yes , sir .
what do you think that means ?
from all you &apos;ve told me these last weeks , I should say it could mean ... any one of a number of quite unpleasant things .
- I &apos;ve to get into that house tonight .
- Not while he &apos;s there .
- He goes out every evening ?
- Right , sir .
tonight after dinner .
Nancy says he &apos;s told her not to let her mistress see anyone .
then you &apos;ll have to see to it that Nancy isn &apos;t home tonight .
- Any little thing I can do for the Yard , sir .
- I thought you wouldn &apos;t mind .
there &apos;s just one thing more though .
how do you know the lady herself will see you ?
I don &apos;t know .
Yes .
I think there &apos;s a way .
&quot; people who go every night to places of public amusement ...
&quot; can hardly enter into ... &quot;
your mother was mad .
&quot; people who go every night to places of public amusement ...
&quot; can hardly enter into the fresh gala feeling ...
&quot; with which an opera or a concert ... &quot;
she died in an asylum with no brain at all .
&quot; the snug comfort of the close carriage ...
&quot; ... the pleasure of setting out with companions ...
&quot; ... the sight of the stars glinting fitfully through the trees ... &quot;
I &apos;m sorry , sir , but the mistress won &apos;t see anyone .
did she tell you to say that ? you &apos;re Elizabeth , aren &apos;t you ?
- How &apos;d you know my name ?
- I know many things about this house .
you &apos;re fond of her , aren &apos;t you ? you &apos;d like to help her , wouldn &apos;t you ?
this is your chance because I &apos;m a friend , and you &apos;re going to let me see her .
no . I don &apos;t dare , sir . I &apos;d lose me place .
really , I don &apos;t dare ...
- My husband isn &apos;t here .
- I know that , Mrs. Anton .
it &apos;s you I want to see .
go away . I &apos;m ill . I can &apos;t see anyone .
Elizabeth , stop him . I didn &apos;t ask him to come .
Mrs. Anton , my name is Brian Cameron .
you mustn &apos;t come here . go away .
not until I &apos;ve given you this . look at it , please .
Alice Alquist gave it to me years ago at Covent Garden .
I was a little boy overcome with admiration .
now you &apos;ll trust me , won &apos;t you ?
you .
she gave it to you .
after all these years ... the great admirer she used to make such a mystery of .
tell me something , Mrs. Anton .
are you planning on going away somewhere ?
go away ? why , no . I have nowhere to go .
unless my husband sends me away .
is that why you came here ? to take me away ?
are you as frightened as all that ?
I &apos;m sorry . I haven &apos;t talked to anyone for a long time .
I can &apos;t talk to you , either . I &apos;m not ...
I &apos;m afraid I ...
you &apos;re afraid you &apos;re going out of your mind .
I &apos;m here to prove to you that you &apos;re not .
to help me do that , you &apos;ve got to answer my questions .
tell me now ... where is your husband now ?
where has he gone ?
he has taken a studio where he can work on his composing .
he can &apos;t work in this house . he has to have it quiet .
tell me , is there anyone else in the house now except us and Elizabeth ?
- No . why ?
- The gas just went down .
- You saw that , too ?
- Why , yes .
then it really happens . I thought I imagined it .
that only means that someone else has turned it on .
I thought that , too , but every night , I &apos;ve been all over the house ... and there &apos;s never been another light turned on .
at last I can tell this to someone . every night when my husband goes out ...
the light goes down ?
- Yes .
- And then what ?
then I think I hear things .
I watch and wait .
- Later on , the gas goes up again .
- And he comes back .
Yes . quite soon after .
always quite soon after .
you say you think you hear things . what things ?
sounds . noises over my room .
- What &apos;s up there ?
- A whole floor of trunks and furniture .
- Is that what you meant ?
- Yes !
but who ?
Mrs. Anton , you know , don &apos;t you ?
- You know who &apos;s up there . - No .
- Are you sure you don &apos;t ?
- No .
- How could he be ?
- There &apos;s an alley behind these houses .
he goes in the back of Number 5 , that &apos;s the empty one ... and then across the roof .
why ?
- You said there &apos;s old furniture up there .
- My aunt &apos;s .
and her clothes , stage costumes , trunks , all of her things .
all of her things ?
and they said the case was dead .
tell me , has he any weapons in the house ?
- He has a revolver . why shouldn &apos;t he ?
- Do you know where he keeps it ?
I think he has it in his desk in there .
you can &apos;t open his desk .
no . you have no right to .
whoever you are , you have no right to !
he &apos;ll know . he &apos;ll think that I ...
what should I say to him ?
you won &apos;t have to say anything .
perhaps it &apos;s a good thing I came tonight .
I was right .
there was a letter .
- And it was from Sergis Bauer .
- What was that ?
- What was that name you said ?
- Sergis Bauer .
I found this , but my husband said I dreamed , and now it &apos;s here .
- Bauer .
- It &apos;s been here the whole time .
there was a Sergis Bauer connected with Alice Alquist .
he was a young pianist who played for her in Prague . let me see that .
&quot; dear Miss Alquist , I beg of you to see me once more .
&quot; I followed you to London . &quot;
look .
&quot; dear Lady Dalroy ... &quot; This is my husband &apos;s writing .
so is this .
your husband and Sergis Bauer are one and the same person .
this letter from him to Alice Alquist was written two days before her murder .
he said there was no letter , that I was going out of my mind !
no . you &apos;re slowly and systematically being driven out of your mind .
why ?
perhaps because you found this letter and know too much .
or because then he would have control of your property , of this house ... and could search in the open instead of the dark like this .
search ? what is there to search for ?
for the things for which Alice Alquist was murdered :
her jewels .
I have her jewels .
they &apos;re the jewels you didn &apos;t know she had . famous jewels .
jewels for which he was searching that night ... when he was frightened away by hearing someone come down the stairs .
someone he never saw .
a little girl .
me .
so he was here that night , but he never ...
he never knew her .
you &apos;re wrong . you &apos;re making a mistake .
I know him . he &apos;s my husband .
I &apos;ve lived in the same house with him .
you &apos;re talking about the man I &apos;m married to .
Mrs. Anton , there &apos;s not a detail of the Alquist case that I don &apos;t know ... and unless I &apos;m more mistaken than I &apos;ve ever been in my life ... the man called Sergis Bauer has a wife living in Prague now .
so you see , he must have planned the whole thing ... step by step from that night .
if that were true , then from the beginning , there would have been nothing .
nothing real from the beginning .
I &apos;m sorry to take everything away from you like this .
- No .
- But you must believe me .
your life depends on what you &apos;re going to do now .
nothing less than your whole life .
don &apos;t you see the way everything fits in ?
the gas .
how long has it been up ?
Elizabeth , whatever happens tonight , have her welfare in mind .
you can count on me , sir .
but what am I going to say to the master when he comes back ?
he won &apos;t come back anymore , Elizabeth .
- What are you doing ?
- I was lying down .
fully dressed ?
- Did you hear what I said ?
- Yes .
then why don &apos;t you answer ?
- I don &apos;t know .
- You don &apos;t know ?
do you know anything about anything you do ?
I will be obliged if you will come with me to my room .
sit down in this chair .
you know what you remind me of as you walk across the room ?
have you ever seen anyone walking in their sleep ?
but you &apos;re not asleep . no , you can &apos;t deceive me .
you &apos;re fully awake , or you would not have broken open my desk !
now be careful how you answer .
why did you open my desk ?
I didn &apos;t open your desk .
- Nancy ?
- Nancy &apos;s out .
- Who , then ? Elizabeth ?
- No , it wasn &apos;t Elizabeth .
please don &apos;t question me anymore . let me go back ...
no . stay there , Paula .
- Why did you open my desk ?
- I didn &apos;t open your desk .
- Why did you open my desk ?
- I didn &apos;t open your desk . it was he ...
he opened it .
what are you talking about ?
who is he ?
a man .
a man who came to see me .
- When ?
- While you were out .
who let him in ?
Yes , sir ?
who was the man who came to see your mistress while I was out ?
what man , sir ?
come , Elizabeth . you must have answered the bell .
no one was here , sir , while you were out .
but , Elizabeth ...
but you saw him .
you opened the door for him yourself .
Elizabeth , say it !
no , ma &apos;am . I didn &apos;t see anyone at all .
but he was here . I know it .
I know it .
but he was here . I know it !
I saw him . you see how it is , Elizabeth ?
Yes , sir . I see just how it is .
I couldn &apos;t have dreamed it . no , I couldn &apos;t have dreamed it .
did I dream ? did I really dream ? Yes , Paula , you dreamed it .
you dreamed all day long .
- Are you telling me that I &apos;ve dreamed ...
- Everything .
- All that happened ?
- All that did not happen .
then it &apos;s true .
- My mind is going .
- Haven &apos;t I told you ?
- It was a dream .
- Like all the rest .
- Take me away . I can &apos;t fight it anymore .
- I will .
it was a dream . take me away .
was I any part of this curious dream of yours , Mrs. Anton ?
you .
perhaps my presence here might help you to recall it .
who the devil are you ?
apparently a mere figment of your wife &apos;s imagination .
- Through the skylight , like you ... and down these stairs .
you made it very easy .
will you tell me what you &apos;re doing here ?
Mrs. Anton , I think you &apos;d better go to bed . you must be tired .
you &apos;d better explain your business , sir .
as a mere figment , as a mere ghost existing in your wife &apos;s mind ...
I could hardly be said to have any business .
Paula , go to your room , please .
so you found them after all .
I was right about you .
I knew from the moment I saw you that you were dangerous to me .
I knew from the first moment I saw you that you were dangerous to her .
I should have followed my instinct about you , as you followed yours .
I thought she was Alice Alquist come back to life .
I didn &apos;t know then that she was walking with Sergis Bauer .
- I &apos;m afraid I don &apos;t know your name .
- Cameron . want my address , too ?
- No . I think I can guess it .
- So we both ended our search tonight .
this is where Alice Alquist hid them .
where the world could see them , yet no one would know where they were ... except the man who gave them to her , watching from the royal box .
pretty clever of her to put four priceless jewels among a lot of paste and tape .
- For the last time , what do you want ?
- The jewels , and justice .
how does it feel , Bauer , to have planned and killed and tortured for something ...
- and then to know it &apos;s been for nothing ?
- For nothing ?
what is it , ma &apos;am ? I thought I heard a shot .
help ! Mr. Williams , come quick !
up there !
anybody at home ?
well , Mrs. Anton , you believe me now .
perhaps you &apos;d like to see these things .
they cost a woman &apos;s life . they cost you something , too .
- I want to speak to my husband .
- Mrs. Anton , I don &apos;t think that &apos;s advisable .
- I want to speak to him alone .
- I &apos;m afraid that &apos;s impossible .
- I assure you , I &apos;m quite helpless .
- Please .
I &apos;ll be waiting on the stairs .
go and see if he &apos;s listening .
- He is not listening .
- You have got confidence in him .
- Did he tell you a lot of things about me ?
- Yes .
- They were lies .
- Why should he lie to me ?
because he &apos;s in love with you . I can tell . I feel it .
do you ? do you really , Gregory ? or shall I call you Sergis ?
so he told you that , too . what of it ?
have you never heard of an artist taking a stage name ? Sergis Bauer &apos;s mine .
it was a part of my life I didn &apos;t care to tell you about .
I was a failure then .
- They don &apos;t hang a man for that , do they ?
- No , they don &apos;t hang a man for that .
you remember our first days . you remember Italy ?
there have been times when I thought I only dreamed those days .
come closer , Paula .
closer .
look into my eyes .
if I ever meant anything to you , and I believe I did ... then help me , Paula .
look , in the drawer of that cupboard there is a knife .
get it and cut me free .
be quick , Paula . get me the knife . cut me free .
would you get it , Paula ? would you get it for me ?
Yes , I &apos;ll get it . I &apos;ll get it for you .
hurry , Paula .
- There &apos;s no knife here .
- Yes . I put it there .
- I don &apos;t see any knife .
- I put it there tonight .
no , it isn &apos;t here . you must have dreamed you put it there .
are you suggesting that this is a knife I hold in my hand ?
have you gone mad , my husband ?
or is it I who am mad ? Yes , of course . that &apos;s it .
I am mad .
I &apos;m always losing things and hiding things .
I can never find them . I don &apos;t know where I put them .
that was a knife , wasn &apos;t it ? and I have lost it .
- Paula ...
- I must look for it , mustn &apos;t I ?
if I don &apos;t find it , you will put me in the madhouse .
where could it be , now ? perhaps it &apos;s behind this picture .
Yes , it must be here . no . where shall I look now ?
perhaps I put it over here . Yes , I must have done that .
my broach . the broach I lost at the Tower .
I found it at last ! you see ? but it doesn &apos;t help you , does it ?
and I &apos;m trying to help you to escape , aren &apos;t I ?
- How can a madwoman help you escape ?
- But you &apos;re not mad .
Yes , I am mad , as my mother was !
no , Paula . that wasn &apos;t true ! help me .
if I were not mad , I could have helped you .
whatever you had done , I could have pitied and protected you .
but because I am mad , I hate you .
because I am mad , I have betrayed you , and because I am mad ...
I am rejoicing in my heart without a shred of pity ... without a shred of regret , watching you go with glory in my heart !
Mr. Cameron , come . come , Mr. Cameron . take this man away !
take this man away !
- You ready ?
- Quite ready .
I don &apos;t ask you to understand me .
between us all the time were those jewels , like a fire .
a fire in my brain that separated us ...
those jewels which I wanted all my life .
I don &apos;t know why .
the cab is coming , Mr. Cameron .
Goodbye , Paula .
Goodbye , Gregory .
this night will be a long night .
but it will end . it &apos;s starting to clear .
in the morning , when the sun rises ... sometimes it &apos;s hard to believe there ever was a night .
you &apos;ll find that , too .
let me come and see you and talk to you . perhaps I can help somehow .
you &apos;re very kind .
well !
are you number two boat ?
faster !
he was on number one last time I saw him .
lady , you don &apos;t look like somebody that &apos;s just been shipwrecked .
- Man , I certainly feel like it !
did you see anything of Charcoal ?
- Who ?
- Joe , the steward .
he helped me into the lifeboat with my things .
I thought this boat was abandoned .
not by me , it wasn &apos;t . it looked pretty good to me .
what part of the ship are you from , darling ?
engine room .
I was off duty in the washroom . thanks .
caught with my ...
I was washing my hands when the torpedo smacked us .
most of the crew were trapped like rats .
when they got to topside , it was a shambles .
quite a night !
reminds me of an air raid once that hit me in Chungking . reminded me of a slaughterhouse I once worked at in Chicago .
those Nazi buzzards in tin fish ain &apos;t enough ... They &apos;ve got to shell us too !
ha ! now I can perfect my backhand .
get that ! it might come in handy .
let &apos;s have the cap too .
what are we worryin &apos; about this junk for ?
let &apos;s take a look for the others before that U-boat surfaces again and sees us .
she won &apos;t surface . one of our shells got her .
are you sure ?
she was killed dead , darling . went down like a rock .
- Did you see it ?
- It &apos;s all in here , my pet .
you &apos;re Constance Porter . I heard you were aboard .
- So you took pictures ?
- And what pictures . priceless !
Oh , I caught some wonderful shots on deck .
a little knot of people around one of the lifeboats .
they look slow and heavy and fat with the life belts on , so lonesome .
then a shell hit the lifeboat . they all jumped overboard .
I got a beautiful shot of the gun crew firing at the submarine .
but the best of all was in the boat , here , with Joe .
I got the freighter going down , one of the lifeboats caught in the suction and pulled under .
I got some of the U-boat crew jumping overboard and I also got —
look ! that &apos;s a perfect touch !
what did you do that for ?
why don &apos;t you wait for the baby to float by and photograph that ?
help !
Gangway !
you stupid , clumsy , son-of-a —
why don &apos;t you look where you &apos;re going ?
absolutely irreplaceable stuff . priceless . the best film I ever took !
- Goes to the bottom of the sea !
- That &apos;s better than going there yourself !
I wouldn &apos;t have parted with that film for a million dollars !
when will I ever get stuff like that again ? of all the stupid , clumsy —
maybe we can arrange another shipwreck for you sometime .
Sparks , did you have time to send out an SOS ?
hardly . the first shell from the U-boat did for the radio shack !
keep going , Kovac , there &apos;s more people out there !
- Where &apos;d this come from ?
- It was floating by .
Miss MacKenzie !
- Stanley !
- She &apos;s out there !
she &apos;s alive . come on , Kovac ! come on !
there &apos;s somebody out there .
to your right , Kovac !
there &apos;s three of them . swing over , Kovac !
hurry , we &apos;ve got a wounded man !
step on it !
a dame !
never mind me . help him . he &apos;s hurt his leg !
- Well , hang on , Miss ! - Well , folks , we &apos;re in business again .
- Somebody gonna give me a hand ?
- Ritt !
- You old rat ! - Connie !
did you come from the freighter or the Stork Club ?
- Still striking oil , I see , eh , Ritt ?
- Anybody got any liquor ?
I &apos;ll have this off you in a jiffy .
I &apos;m okay , Sparks . what happened to Nolan ?
I was on my way from the bridge to bring him our position .
a shell from the U-boat hit the radio shack !
I was at the wheel waiting &apos; for Hennessy to relieve me .
just set the mug up with some hot java when —
holy smokes ! look at this mess .
maybe we &apos;d better get the raft back .
do you think we &apos;ll stay afloat ?
if the buoyancy tanks are okay she &apos;ll float , even if we &apos;re waterlogged .
I see you &apos;ve even managed to get some of your luggage aboard .
- Just the bare necessities .
- Uh , look at that !
six full boxes , and I had to grab this one .
don &apos;t cry , my pet . it &apos;ll last until we &apos;re picked up . I hope .
- First shell must &apos;ve done for the skipper .
- And most of the gun crew .
what happened to the woman with the baby ?
see if you can find a first-aid kit .
I thought everybody was killed . I never expected to see you alive .
you know I &apos;m practically immortal , Ritt !
I — I thought I was done for .
see , we were playing poker in the saloon —
now , how do you get this thing off ?
here &apos;s the first-aid kit . it &apos;s been pretty well smashed up .
Oh ! I need something to cover him up with .
let me have that blanket , please .
bandages , please .
well , share and share alike , I always say !
- Lie down , please .
- What for ?
you &apos;ll be more comfortable . I wanna take a look at your leg .
Oh , well , okay , babe . maybe you &apos;ll let me return the compliment someday !
- Lie down , please .
- I think it &apos;s got a hunk of slug in it .
it was the biggest pot of the game , but believe you me , I never even stopped to collect it .
- That pot went to Davy Jones .
- Well , not all of it .
- Here &apos;s 20 bucks Mr Jones didn &apos;t get .
- Well , it &apos;s yours .
- It was floating in the water .
- Well , keep it .
no , go on ! I insist ! it &apos;s probably legitimate as salvage .
- You one of the crew , son ?
- Black gang . Oiler . name &apos;s Kovac .
- Kovac , eh ? my name &apos;s Rittenhouse .
- Glad to —
- C.J. Rittenhouse ?
- C.J. Rittenhouse !
- Junior .
- Here .
are you sure there &apos;s no sulfanilamide eft in the kit ?
afraid not .
- Hurt ?
- No .
here &apos;s the shrapnel . thought you might like to keep it as a souvenir .
Nah ! my hide was full of that stuff on the last trip .
- Hold it steady !
- I oughta have my head examined .
this is the fourth time I &apos;ve shipped out since the war , and I ain &apos;t got no place yet !
gee , I wish I could make the complete round-trip just once .
- How does it look ?
- It &apos;s a pretty deep cut .
it &apos;s leakin &apos; .
I ain &apos;t gonna wind up with a gimpy leg , am I ?
no ! not enough to interfere with your jitterbugging !
- Jive , huh ?
- Eh , tell her , Sparks !
why he &apos;s the champion hoofer of the merchant marines . tell her what I done in Jersey City .
listen , I copped two prizes at Roseland one year , and all the time , I &apos;m suffering somethin &apos; terrible from double pneumonia .
I can out-jive the rest of those hepcats even with a bum gam .
everything under control ? anything I can do ?
you ain &apos;t got somethin &apos; to drink on ya ?
- Sorry , son ! not a drop .
- I have some brandy , darling .
Oh , boy ! I could sure go for some of that .
- I &apos;ll get my flask .
- No ! in a case like this , the rule is to —
come on ! we &apos;re among friends , ain &apos;t we ?
it &apos;ll pick me up ! make up your minds , darlings !
help !
help !
it &apos;s Charcoal !
it &apos;s the steward !
there &apos;s a woman . and a baby .
easy there !
are you all right , Joe ?
I got my feet wet a little bit .
she was fightin &apos; me all the time in the water .
she tried to drown the baby and herself with it .
huh , it &apos;s all right , sister . you &apos;re safe .
the baby &apos;s safe . it &apos;s all right . the danger &apos;s over .
you &apos;re safe now . nothing to worry about .
best let her have it . we &apos;ll wait till she &apos;s asleep .
here !
Hey ! that &apos;s right !
her name &apos;s Higley . she was bombed out in Bristol .
one of them shell shock cases sent to America .
her child was born in New York .
said to me on the ship , &quot; I &apos;m going home to show my husband the baby ! &quot;
here , darling . you &apos;d better put this on .
Hey , look . another customer .
where &apos;d he come from ? is he a crew member ?
I never saw him before . not off our boat .
Danke schön .
he &apos;s very grateful to us for having saved his life .
regrets very much the U-boat was compelled to sink our ship .
ask him why they shelled our lifeboats .
- Captain &apos;s orders !
- If you ask me , he &apos;s the captain himself .
ask him if he &apos;s the captain .
he says he &apos;s not a captain or officer , just a crew member .
well , crew member or skipper , he &apos;s German !
a guy can &apos;t help being German if he &apos;s born a German , can he ?
neither can a snake help being a rattlesnake if he &apos;s born a rattlesnake !
that don &apos;t make him a nightingale ! get him outta here !
don &apos;t be silly , darling !
he can &apos;t very well get off in the middle of the ocean , can he ?
- Throw him off !
- Have you gone out of your mind ?
- Throw the Nazi buzzard overboard !
- That &apos;s out of the question !
- It &apos;s against the law .
- Whose law ?
we &apos;re on our own . we can make our own law !
now , just a minute ! he was acting under orders .
our freighter was an enemy ship . after all , we &apos;re at war .
is that woman at war ? is her baby at war ?
and listen , how come you know the lingo so well ?
how come when I climbed into this lifeboat you were the only one in it , all dressed up like you knew you were going someplace ?
I was going someplace . I was going into a lifeboat .
what is this ? are you insinuating ?
you seem pretty anxious to stand up for your friend here !
what do you mean , &quot; my friend &quot; ?
now , children , let &apos;s keep our shirts on !
I haven &apos;t got a shirt or a mink coat either !
Oh , I get it !
a fellow traveller !
I thought the Comintern was dissolved !
now , we &apos;re all sort of fellow travellers , in a mighty small boat , on a mighty big ocean !
and the more we quarrel and criticize and misunderstand each other , the bigger the ocean gets , and the smaller the boat .
the boat &apos;s too small for me and this German !
me , I &apos;m perfectly willing to abide by the decision of the majority .
that &apos;s the American way .
if we harm this man , we are guilty of the same tactics you hate him for .
on the other hand , if we treat him with kindness and consideration , we might be able to convert him to our way of thinking .
that &apos;s the , uh ... That &apos;s the Christian way .
okay ! now , me , I &apos;m American too . I was born one in Chicago .
but my people are from Czechoslovakia ! ever hear of that place ?
I say let &apos;s throw him overboard and watch him drown !
when he goes down , I &apos;ll dance a jig like Hitler did when France went down !
me , too !
just for the record , I &apos;m an American , myself !
I &apos;m in a kind of a spot .
my name is Schmidt , but I changed it to Smith .
that &apos;s what I got against these guys more than anything else .
they make me ashamed of the name I was born with .
I got a lot of relatives in Germany .
for all I know , this guy may be one of them !
I say , throw him to the sharks !
no , Gus ! I don &apos;t say it wouldn &apos;t be a pleasure , mind you , but — we haven &apos;t got the right !
&quot; the right &quot; ? what do you mean , &quot; the right &quot; ?
well , he &apos;s a prisoner of war . got to be treated as such .
the way it &apos;s done is to hang on to him till we &apos;re picked up , then turn him over to proper authorities .
till such time , we represent the authorities .
that &apos;s clear , isn &apos;t it ?
- You see what I mean , miss ?
- I don &apos;t understand any of it .
I don &apos;t understand people hurting each other and killing each other .
I just don &apos;t understand it .
- Then what are you doing in a uniform ?
- I &apos;m doing the only thing I can .
trying to put them together again when they get hurt .
as far as the German &apos;s concerned , I — I agree with Stanley .
so do I .
I &apos;ll talk to the man . maybe I can get some information from him .
- Material for your book ?
- Incidentally !
- George ?
- What do you say , Joe ?
- Do I get to vote too ? - Why ...
why certainly !
guess I &apos;d rather stay out of this .
how about you , sister ?
my baby &apos;s dead .
does anyone know the service for burial at sea ?
well , I , uh ... I suppose , any prayer would do .
let me see , now .
the Lord is my shepherd . uh , I shall not want .
he maketh me to lie down in green pastures .
he , uh ... He , uh ...
he leadeth me beside the still waters .
he restoreth my soul .
he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness , for His name &apos;s sake .
Yea , though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil .
for thou art with me . thy rod and thy staff , they comfort me .
surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life .
and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever .
amen .
well , I don &apos;t know how much of this stuff is any use to us .
isn &apos;t much we can do with these food compartments .
well , at any rate , things are getting shipshape .
none of the buoyancy tanks seem to have been smashed .
the water breaker &apos;s been taped up , and in the morning we &apos;ll rig up a sail and get going .
and in the meantime , I think , we &apos;d all better try and get some sleep .
uh , Kovac , don &apos;t forget to wake me for my watch .
we &apos;d better send up another flare soon .
how do you feel , darling ?
better , thank you !
much better !
- Have I been asleep long ?
- Not very .
what &apos;s this ?
Mrs Porter lent you her coat to help keep you warm .
it &apos;s a beautiful coat .
- Is it real mink ?
- I hope so .
it &apos;s lovely .
I &apos;ve always admired mink .
it &apos;s the most ladylike fur there is , I always said .
so warm and comfortable .
thank you so much for letting me wear it .
where &apos;s Johnny ?
where &apos;s my baby ?
what have you done with him ?
what did you do with my baby ?
your baby &apos;s dead ! don &apos;t you remember ?
you killed him , didn &apos;t you ?
poor little thing !
the sea ... so big and terrible .
Johnny , it &apos;s Mum !
where are you ?
where are you , Johnny ?
Johnny !
let me go ! let me go to him !
get a rope , somebody ! we &apos;ve got to tie her down !
here you are .
let me go to him .
let me go .
- Good morning , sir !
- Hmm ? Oh !
good morning , Sparks ! asleep on watch !
it &apos;s a fine thing ! I oughta be court-martialed !
I wonder how much we &apos;ve drifted .
not very far with that sea-anchor out . Oh , the sea-anchor , of course .
you know , I had no idea what those things looked like .
I thought they were big , heavy iron things with a hook to hold us onto the sea bottom .
when you threw that thing out ,
I thought it was some sort of a toy parachute or something .
they really keep the boat from drifting ?
last time I was adrift , a sea anchor held us up 48 hours in a storm .
- You &apos;ve been torpedoed before ?
- That &apos;s right , twice .
- How long before you were picked up ?
- Last time , it was 43 days .
Forty-three ... That must have been awful !
Yeah ! we did get a bit sunburned .
then , of course , we had a good sound boat .
plenty of food and water . everything intact .
well , haven &apos;t we plenty too ?
a good deal of our food &apos;s been ruined .
three out of the four water breakers have been smashed .
a lot of water leaked out of the fourth one before it was taped .
what worries me is the compass .
knocked to pieces . that &apos;s a bit awkward .
and , of course , there &apos;s Jerry .
Ah , good morning , Mrs Porter .
what &apos;s good about it ?
- How soon do we get picked up ?
- Good morning , Connie .
we were discussing that . it seems there &apos;s no way of telling .
- Did you sleep well ?
- Not a wink .
not only that . I froze .
only had my fur coat to keep me ... warm .
where &apos;s Miss Higley ?
I &apos;m sorry , folks . I &apos;m terribly sorry .
it was pitch black when I relieved you , Kovac .
I couldn &apos;t see a thing .
for all I know , it might have happened during your watch .
- Eight biscuits .
- Minus eight biscuits ! Oh , thanks .
- Kovac , how &apos;s the sail coming along ?
- Coming along !
light , sir ?
uh , no , thanks ! I think , I &apos;ll hoard this heater till we get someplace .
well , folks , I &apos;ve been taking inventory , and we &apos;re in the black .
a going concern . it &apos;s no use lying around , waiting to be picked up .
as we might have to wait as long as , uh ... as 43 days .
so we might as well get organized .
the first order of business is department heads .
- Uh , Sparks ?
- Yes , Mr Rittenhouse .
- Call me Ritt . we &apos;re all in the same boat . - Yes , sir .
Sparks , you are , uh , in charge of navigation .
- Aye , aye , sir !
- Uh , George ?
call me Joe .
- Is your name Joe ?
- Yes , sir .
very well . Joe it is .
- You are head of the commissary .
- Yes , sir .
Connie , will you keep the ship &apos;s log , please ?
Righto , Ritto , providing I control the copyright and all publication rights .
including the Scandinavian !
Yes ! Miss MacKenzie !
you are in charge of sick bay .
don &apos;t look now , but I think we have a skipper .
- Who elected Mr Rittenhouse ?
- Mr Rittenhouse .
Ritt , to you !
- You think he &apos;s capable ?
- Sure ! till the sail goes up .
we never should &apos;ve let him stay on board .
he &apos;ll eat our food , drink our water , and double-cross us , first chance he gets .
what are you afraid of ? he &apos;s one against seven .
it was eight yesterday . or have you forgotten ?
there &apos;s a piece in here about some people who were adrift in a lifeboat for 80 days .
- Say , maybe we can beat that record .
- Heaven forbid !
we might even get in the newsreels .
Rosie &apos;d get a bang outta that .
it &apos;d remind her of the first cup we won at the Garden for marathon dancing .
- We danced 80 consecutive hours .
- Consecutive ?
well , 10 minutes off , every four hours , for coffee , cake — stuff like that .
how &apos;d you feel after 80 hours of dancing ?
I had a slight headache , but Rosie , she was just gettin &apos; wound up .
she grabbed a cab , went right over to Roseland !
- Does she work there ?
- She lives there .
- How does the leg feel now ?
- It don &apos;t feel at all .
I wish I could walk around .
I sure hope that thing don &apos;t leave me gimpy .
- Al &apos;d love that .
- Who &apos;s Al ?
Al Magaroulian . he &apos;s an Armenian rug-cutter .
he knew Rosie before I did .
he &apos;s got fallen arches .
keeps him outta the draft , but not outta Roseland .
Kovac , you know something about machinery , don &apos;t you ?
- A little .
- See if you can fix this clasp .
Mrs Porter , I &apos;ve read a lot of your stuff .
you wanna know what &apos;s the matter with it ?
no , do tell me .
you &apos;ve been all over the world . you &apos;ve met all kinds of people .
but you never write about them , you only write about yourself .
you think this whole war &apos;s a show put on for you to cover , like a Broadway play .
and if enough people die before the last act , maybe you might give it four stars .
come on , Sparks .
- All right , tovarich !
now , listen to me ! - Heads up !
Joe , man the tiller till we &apos;re squared away !
- Well , folks , we &apos;re under way . - Where to ?
- Huh ?
- Where are we going ?
first operator said we were headed for Bermuda .
well , good ! uh , Sparks , you &apos;d better take the tiller .
Yes , sir ! uh , what about the course ?
does anybody here know the course to Bermuda ?
I was at the wheel when we got punctured . the course was 115 east-southeast .
fine , then , east-southeast it is .
Yes , sir ! but , uh , where is east-southeast ?
- Without a compass ...
- What &apos;s the matter with the sun ?
with the sun this high , it &apos;s pretty hard to tell the points of the compass .
I think it &apos;s out that way .
- You think ? - Doesn &apos;t anybody know ?
- He says east-southeast is that direction .
- How &apos;s he know ?
well , he ought to know . his U-boat was operating around here , wasn &apos;t it ?
do you suppose he &apos;d lead us to Bermuda , British territory ?
he says he &apos;d rather be a prisoner of war in Bermuda than here .
at least he &apos;d have good food and a bed .
I wouldn &apos;t trust anything he says .
Kovac , you &apos;re so prejudiced , you can &apos;t think straight .
if anybody &apos;s in the position to know where we are and where Bermuda is , he &apos;s the one .
- Who says so ?
- We &apos;ll follow the German &apos;s course .
who elected you skipper ?
well , I ... &apos; Course , if there &apos;s anybody else you &apos;d prefer ...
what do you know about a ship ?
he just happens to own a shipyard , that &apos;s all .
- Has he ever been in it ?
- He has thousands of employees .
of course he knows how to handle men .
not in a lifeboat . what we need is an able seaman , and we &apos;ve got one .
who , me ? I &apos;m a disabled seaman .
anyhow , I never did have no executive ability .
- I think maybe Sparks there ...
- No , not me .
I know a bit about navigation , but when it comes to taking charge of a boat , well ...
- What about Kovac ?
- That clunk run this boat ?
with what ? an oil can ?
if you &apos;re talking about a skipper , we have a skipper right on this boat .
- He wasn &apos;t the captain .
- Wasn &apos;t he ?
- Herr Kapitän ?
well , I &apos;m a monkey &apos;s uncle .
there ! you have a man who &apos;s familiar with these waters .
he knows seamanship and navigation . what about it ?
you want to turn the boat over to the man who sunk our ship and shelled our lifeboats ?
I want you to turn the boat over to the man obviously best qualified to run it .
- You &apos;re crazy .
- Now , wait a minute .
there are two sides to everything . let &apos;s look at this calmly and reasonably .
the German is just as anxious to get to safety as we are , and if he &apos;s a trained skipper , why shouldn &apos;t he take charge ?
- Because I &apos;m taking charge . - Since when ?
as of now , I &apos;m skipper .
anybody who don &apos;t like it can get out and swim to Bermuda .
- I &apos;ll buy it .
- Suits me .
- What about you , miss ?
- I &apos;m for it .
- Yes , sir !
- Well , if the rest agree ...
all right , Commissar , what &apos;s the course ?
well , we ...
- Which way &apos;d you say , Sparks ?
- Out there .
Nein , nein .
he says if you go your way , you &apos;ll only head further out to sea .
he insists the course to Bermuda is that way .
we &apos;ll head this way . take the tiller , Sparks !
Aye , aye , sir !
careful !
including the Scandinavian .
- How do you feel now , Connie ?
- Awful !
it isn &apos;t the sea that makes me sick , it &apos;s the loss of my typewriter .
that typewriter went with me everywhere ...
Rome , Berlin , Paris , London .
- Oh , quit grousing .
- Why shouldn &apos;t I grouse ?
little by little , I &apos;m being stripped of all my earthly possessions .
first , my beautiful stocking , then my camera .
I don &apos;t mind the loss of the camera so much , but the film in it .
I get positively ill when I think about it .
Hey , do you remember the boom we had after the last war ?
well , the boom we &apos;re gonna have after this one &apos;ll make the last look like a mild flurry .
then my steamer rug goes , then my fur coat , and now my typewriter !
take China , for example .
400 million customers waiting to sign on the dotted line as soon as peace is declared .
I never should &apos;ve taken the freighter . should &apos;ve gone by clipper .
me , too ! I &apos;d have been in Spain by this time .
Spain ? were you going for the state department ?
state department ? certainly not ! I was going for C. J. Rittenhouse .
- What for ?
- What for ? why , my dear fellow !
pipe down , Ritt ! the &quot; Gay-Pay-oo &quot; !
what are you doing with my memo pad ?
I borrowed it from you to make a deck of cards .
never heard such impertinence , opening my bag !
it was open . how about a little draw poker ?
- Eh , suits me fine .
- Deal you in ?
with a deck you &apos;ve made , darling ?
what are you gonna play for ?
dollar limit ? that &apos;ll do for a starter .
- Cut for deal !
- All right !
you deal !
what are those letters on your diaphragm ?
- Love letters .
- Oh , you believe in advertising ?
open !
never could understand this quaint habit of making a billboard out of one &apos;s torso .
- Stay !
- Three cards !
I must say you &apos;ve shown the most commendable delicacy in just tattooing the initial , not printing the names , addresses and telephone numbers .
open !
- Nines ?
- Queens !
see , how many are there ? one , two , three , four , five .
remind me to show you the rest of them sometime .
your deal , my boy .
and see , you deal them off the top .
you mean , you &apos;re used to people dealing off the bottom ?
I was just joking .
I never thought I &apos;d go into it . I used to faint at the sight of blood .
what made you join the merchant marine ?
I don &apos;t know . never thought about it .
I suppose it was &apos; cause I lived in Greenwich .
maybe it was the river there , and the ships .
it &apos;s the first time I &apos;ve ever been to sea .
I was born and raised in the wheat country .
you know , sometimes when the wind blows through the wheat , it looks something like the sea .
well , it &apos;s not a bad life , the merchant marine , except for the U-boats .
after a while , you get to taking even them in your stride .
it &apos;s rather scary the first time , though , isn &apos;t it ?
I &apos;m glad the freighter was torpedoed .
my dear young lady , what an extraordinary thing to say !
what are you doing that for ?
it &apos;s the bandage , Lu . it &apos;s too tight or something .
Oh , wait ! let me !
holy mackerel !
ain &apos;t it a lulu ?
what about it , Miss ?
I don &apos;t know !
I &apos;m afraid it ... looks more like a leg of lamb , don &apos;t it ?
get away from here !
tell him to get back to his place before I throw him overboard !
- What did he say ?
Gus , I &apos;m afraid your leg &apos;s very bad .
gangrene ?
- Ja , Gangrene .
it &apos;ll have to be amputated at once !
I &apos;ve never even assisted in an amputation .
he says , being an enemy and , technically , our prisoner , perhaps you wouldn &apos;t want to trust him with the operation , but he &apos;s willing to do it .
what the devil does he know about it ?
he says he was a surgeon in civilian life . he &apos;s done many operations .
if he did , they were probably illegal .
if he &apos;s a medical man , why isn &apos;t he in medical service ?
I don &apos;t know and I don &apos;t care !
perhaps the gangrene isn &apos;t legal , either , but it &apos;s there !
the leg has to come off .
no dice ! I don &apos;t want no operation !
- Darling , you want to live , don &apos;t you ?
- Not with one leg .
- Don &apos;t be a sap , Gus !
- You don &apos;t understand .
- Sure , I do ! Rosie !
- What &apos;s Rosie got to do with it ?
- Everything ! if I lose my leg , I lose Rosie .
- Of course , I don &apos;t know Rosie .
she loves to dance . it &apos;s her hobby . it &apos;s her whole life .
put yourself in her place . do you like to dance ?
mad about it !
well , then , what good &apos;s a hepcat with one gam missing &apos; ?
- If my leg goes , Rosie goes !
- If she &apos;s that kind of a —
don &apos;t you call Rosie that kind of a —
I oughta know . I introduced you to her , didn &apos;t I ?
no , you didn &apos;t ! Al Magaroulian introduced me to her .
- I knew her before Al Magaroulian did .
- Al Magaroulian —
the heck with Al Magaroulian ! what &apos;s he got to do with it ?
- Rosie &apos;s as good as anybody .
- And a darn sight better .
- If she was the right kind of a woman ...
- Kovac , you take that back !
darling , don &apos;t pay any attention to this human 24-sheet ! listen to me !
I don &apos;t know Rosie , but I know women .
some of my best friends are women .
- And one of &apos; em &apos;s that kind of a —
- What kind of a ?
well , an independent creature who lives her own life !
that &apos;s Rosie all over .
with a heart of gold . and she gives it away .
Rosie &apos;d give the shirt off her back to anybody .
she &apos;s got a heart as big as her head .
and you wanna break it .
- Who , me ?
- Well , you &apos;d rather die than trust her !
who says I don &apos;t trust her ? it &apos;s Al Magaroulian I don &apos;t trust !
he knew her before I did .
she swore to me there was nothing between them , but —
maybe there wasn &apos;t .
but Rosie &apos;s human like everybody else , and it ain &apos;t like we was married , or had a home and all .
maybe we shoulda got hitched before I left on that last trip .
I shoulda took care of that insurance .
Rosie kept askin &apos; me about it .
the kid &apos;s always thinkin &apos; of me .
that &apos;s why you &apos;ve got to think of her , back home , putting on a big show , laughing and dancing , pretending to be having a good time .
and all the while , her heart &apos;s aching , torn with loneliness and uncertainty .
not knowing whether you &apos;re dead or alive .
then , at last , to find out that you risked your life , perhaps even died , just because you had no faith in her ?
God , forgive me !
poor kid , she &apos;d be broken-hearted when she —
well , let &apos;s go ! what are we all waitin &apos; for ?
he &apos;ll need a pail of water , Joe .
- Is there any sort of anaesthetic ?
- Nein .
- You have some brandy , haven &apos;t you ?
- He says brandy &apos;s better than nothing .
- Did I hear brandy ?
- Let me get it for you .
- Oh , thanks , Joe !
can you open it for me ?
that &apos;s right . it &apos;s just here .
- Here , darling .
- Hi-yo , Silver .
he &apos;ll need a tourniquet , a belt or something .
I &apos;ll lose my pants if I take mine off .
- How about your belt , Sparks ?
- Here it is .
- Get it , Joe .
- It was nice knowin &apos; ya .
um , oh , Joe !
he wants a needle and twine from the , uh , boat kit or something .
it &apos;s in a ditty bag , Joe .
Aah !
am I gonna feel good pretty soon .
Kovac , why &apos;d you want to say that about Rosie ?
- Say what ?
- What you said .
- I &apos;m sorry , Gus .
- Take it back !
okay , I take it back .
what can we use for forceps ? you have tweezers ?
I &apos;ve got tweezers . Yes , Joe , you &apos;ll find them in my bag .
- The little box on the top .
- Right .
ask him how much of that stuff he can drink .
go ahead , Gus ! the works ! down the hatch !
I &apos;ll never forget you .
Joe , clear away some of that stuff .
we &apos;ll lay him out here .
we &apos;ll need something for weights to hold it down .
Kovac , you know what I think of that no-good , snake-in-the-grass friend of yours , Al Magaroulian ?
Magaroulian &apos;s no friend of mine .
Magaroulian &apos;s a skunk .
Two-legged skunk .
- I hate his guts .
- You &apos;re okay , pal .
Hi , Lu !
Hiya , Gus !
well , anyway , it &apos;s an experience !
I oughta have my head examined .
I didn &apos;t have to go to sea .
I coulda got a job in a defence plant making good dough .
I coulda joined the army , or even the navy .
&apos;Stead of that , I got assigned on a stinking ol &apos; rust bucket .
Mr Rittenhouse ?
Yes , son ?
call me Gus !
Hiya , babe !
- Hi , toots !
- Give us a kiss , will ya ?
Hey , Joe . what &apos;d ya stop playin &apos; for ?
come on ! give us a little music !
no , no ! none of that slicker music !
come on ! come on ! Boogie it up !
tell him to hold the boat as steady as possible .
- Steady as you go , Sparks !
- Righto !
saying a thing like that !
just because she likes to dance and have a good time !
nobody &apos;s gonna call Rosie —
Hey , Kovac ! you &apos;re a no-good heel .
take his backrest away .
- All right ! look alive now , Sparks !
- Righto !
bring more bandages !
Joe !
Mr Kovac !
keep her steady , you fool !
open .
- Stay . - Three cards .
bet one .
call . Nines .
queens .
give &apos; em a good shuffle . okay , cut &apos; em .
fill another inside straight , I &apos;ll cut your throat !
it &apos;s lucky for Gus we had somebody aboard who knew how to meet an emergency like this .
two more cards , darling .
you know , by golly , the thing that got me —
play cards , Ritt !
- Say , what are you two gabbing about ?
- Currents .
not the pie kind , darling , the ocean kind .
fascinating subject , currents . they &apos;re either for you or agin you .
Connie , darling , do you stay or do you pass ?
Ritt , darling , I &apos;ve already stayed .
- Yeah , well , it &apos;ll cost you two bucks more . - Oh !
- Connie !
hold your horses , darling ! I &apos;m in a conference .
- Women and poker !
- I &apos;ll stay .
fortunately , Kapitän seems to think we &apos;re on a favouring current , quite swift .
we got a favouring breeze , too .
good ! then we ought to be in Bermuda in no time .
I hope so , for Gus &apos;s sake .
that is , if we &apos;re on the right course .
- Well , does he still think we &apos;re not ?
- He didn &apos;t say anything about it .
well , ask him !
one can &apos;t be sure without a compass .
- He was pretty certain a few hours ago .
- Yeah !
I wonder what made him change his mind .
we probably drifted somewhat on account of the current .
we &apos;ve been through all that .
what &apos;s he doing in this part of the boat , anyway ?
why ? is he in quarantine ?
- Tell him to get back to the bow .
- I &apos;ll do nothing of the sort .
you may be skipper of this lifeboat , but you &apos;re not dictator ! or are you ?
wait a minute , Kovac ! there &apos;s no sense treating the man like a leper .
he did save Gus &apos;s life , you know .
for the time being . after all , it was an emergency operation .
don &apos;t you realize that it &apos;s imperative we get Gus to a hospital as soon as possible ?
sure , I do .
then , why not listen to somebody who knows ?
how do you like that ? now he isn &apos;t sure ! says he won &apos;t take responsibility !
but that &apos;s not the point ! the point is , are we headed for Bermuda ?
what &apos;s come over the man ? all you got to do is answer yes or no .
he admits , we &apos;re on the wrong course .
&quot; admits &quot; ? he &apos;s only saying what he said before .
- I had to drag it out of him .
he says — - I don &apos;t care what he says !
- Yeah , but suppose he &apos;s right !
- That &apos;s my funeral .
no , it &apos;s not . it &apos;s Gus &apos;s funeral !
whose funeral ?
Hey , wait a minute ! what is this ?
well , fella , how do you feel now , huh ?
in the pink .
outside of a little hangover .
right now I &apos;d give the other leg for a cigarette .
here , darling .
guess maybe I lost a little weight , huh ?
you &apos;ll be all right , Gus . he did a swell job .
Danke schön .
well , skipper , how soon do we get to Bermuda ?
pretty soon , Gus . we &apos;ve got a good breeze and a favouring current .
there &apos;s a little difference of opinion about the direction we &apos;re headed .
trouble is , I &apos;m not sure about our course .
I &apos;m only sure of one thing . I don &apos;t trust that Nazi .
there must be other submarines around and he knows where they are .
or maybe a supply ship !
he knows where that is too .
on general principle , I &apos;d copper anything he says . that &apos;s how I stand .
you agree with me , Sparks ?
well ...
does anybody agree with me ?
you &apos;re the skipper !
all right , Sparks .
follow the German &apos;s course .
I , uh , was admiring your bracelet .
- Gift from a husband .
- It &apos;s gorgeous .
my first husband .
glad the freighter was torpedoed .
- What ?
- That &apos;s what you said yesterday .
that was a stupid thing to say ! I didn &apos;t mean it , exactly .
what did you mean , exactly ?
I only meant , I was rather glad that we ...
well , I wasn &apos;t particularly anxious to get to London .
what are you afraid of in London ?
myself .
I mean , uh , it &apos;s a personal problem . in other words , I ...
I know , darling ! I know !
Genus Homo . male .
and married , but not to me .
- You call that a problem ? - It is to me .
fiddlesticks !
I don &apos;t want to pry into your personal affairs , darling , but you know what &apos;s the matter with you ?
you &apos;ve been reading Kipling . &quot; the sins ye do by two and two you must pay for , one by one ! &quot;
&apos;Course I don &apos;t know who the guy is .
but I know men ... especially married men !
some of my best friends —
don &apos;t let her upset you .
she certainly has a way of getting at things .
that &apos;s right .
I didn &apos;t mind her prying , really . I wanted to talk .
maybe that &apos;s why I &apos;m all mixed up , because I &apos;ve never told anybody .
I think I &apos;d rather tell you than anybody .
his name is Stephen .
he &apos;s a doctor .
we worked in the same hospital .
all the time , I knew he was married .
his wife &apos;s a fine woman , and they have two beautiful children .
so , you see , it was hopeless . it was quite hopeless .
Yes , of course ! I ... I see !
well , we both decided to forget about it .
and when he enlisted and was sent to London , I was glad .
I was really glad .
I tried to forget him , but I couldn &apos;t .
he wrote several times . I never answered .
and then when I was assigned to London myself ...
well , I knew if we met there , away from home , away from every —
I &apos;m sorry .
maybe I &apos;d better wait till I get home and take it up with Mr Whosits on the Goodwill Hour .
sometimes that programme &apos;s funny .
sometimes it isn &apos;t a bit .
when people are in trouble , they turn themselves inside-out .
seem to feel better when they get some sort of an answer .
whether they get an answer or not , they feel better .
thank you , Stanley .
lovely night we &apos;re having . lots of stars out tonight .
I remember the night before we was torpedoed .
Nolan was — He was my first .
- Yes , I met him on the boat .
- That &apos;s right . Yes .
he was telling me all about his wife going to stay with her family in Bermuda .
and how it &apos;s changed since the war .
he told me that ...
I remember as he pointed out our course over the bows ,
I saw the planet Mars low on the horizon .
that &apos;s Mars over there , to the right .
and that &apos;s Venus .
we &apos;re headed for Venus . we &apos;re going East .
we &apos;re not heading for Bermuda . we &apos;re heading to miss Bermuda .
well , we &apos;ll see about that .
after all , we did have to drag it out of ...
that &apos;s part of the trick . he made suckers out of all of us .
Kovac , I still say , we have no right to condemn the man without a hearing .
perhaps the course he gave us was wrong , but that doesn &apos;t prove anything .
he might have been mistaken .
when I questioned him yesterday , he didn &apos;t want to commit himself .
he said one couldn &apos;t be sure without a compass .
the thing to do is to wake him up and question him .
we &apos;ll get nothing but lies . that &apos;s what he was brought up on .
and I was brought up under the idea that a man is innocent until he &apos;s proved guilty .
what do you want me to do ? appoint one of us to be his lawyer ?
but don &apos;t you see , without a compass ...
Mrs Porter , remember yesterday , you looked at your watch and told the German the time ?
- Yes !
- Did he ask you the time ?
of course he did .
- That &apos;s funny .
- What &apos;s funny about it ?
- He had a watch of his own .
- Well , what of it ?
if he had a watch , why would he have to ask Mrs Porter for the time ?
that doesn &apos;t prove anything .
lots of times I have my own watch in my pocket and I ask somebody the time .
lots of people do that ! it just , uh ... It just saves time , that &apos;s all .
but he looked at his own watch just before he asked Mrs Porter .
perhaps his own watch stopped .
I remember when he asked for the time , he took a squint at the sun .
what are you trying to do ? convict a man because he looks at the sun ?
- Is it a crime to ask for the time ?
- Certainly not .
- What time is it ?
- Ten past 7 : 00 .
- I think you &apos;re slow .
- Slow ? that &apos;s a Philippe Patek .
I wanna know what time it is by the German &apos;s watch .
well , why don &apos;t you wake him up and ask him ?
don &apos;t have to wake him up . not with Joe around .
- Joe .
- Yeah ?
- Operate .
- Huh ?
do your stuff .
what stuff ? I don &apos;t know what you mean .
frisk him for his turnip .
- I cut that stuff out a long time ago .
- But this is an emergency .
- The folks &apos;ll understand .
- Understand what ?
Joe used to be one of the best all-around —
now , wait a minute , Gus !
you ain &apos;t got no right bringing &apos; up what used to be .
that &apos;s all right , Joe . some of my best friends are —
I know , but I made a pledge , a solemn pledge .
do you wanna commit mutiny ?
- Is it an order ?
- It &apos;s an order .
Oh , I can &apos;t . the guy &apos;s asleep .
that &apos;s a break , isn &apos;t it ?
Yeah , but it &apos;s like ... It &apos;s like shootin &apos; a sittin &apos; duck !
quit stalling !
if your conscience bothers you , wake him up ! only , get the ticker !
- Kovac !
looks like quite a blow .
pardon me ! I &apos;m ... sorry !
now , you know the right time .
dirty double-crossing rat !
Kovac , what are you gonna do ?
- What do you think we &apos;re gonna do ?
- Don &apos;t say &quot; we &quot; !
- I &apos;ll not consent to a thing like this .
- I &apos;m not consulting you .
- There &apos;s only one thing to do with the guy .
- But , Kovac , it &apos;s ... it &apos;s murder !
it &apos;s execution !
- No , we can &apos;t ! we mustn &apos;t !
- There must be some other way .
why can &apos;t we tie him up , keep a watch on him ?
let him have it , Kovac ! right now !
I &apos;m not defending the man .
but why can &apos;t we wait till it &apos;s night ? then , in the morning —
what are you so squeamish about ? we &apos;re at war !
you &apos;ve seen &apos; em killed , haven &apos;t you ?
in battle , yes ! but not in cold blood like this !
- Look out !
- Stanley !
you fools ! stop thinking of yourselves ! think of the boat !
Joe , take the sheet ! make it fast !
Kovac , man the pump !
the rest of you bail !
what do you know ? we got a führer !
never mind about that baggage ! start bailing !
- You speak English !
- Of course I speak English !
- Can we stay afloat ?
- Those buoyancy tanks &apos;ll hold us up .
Oh ! my suitcase !
get that , somebody !
Rittenhouse ! lash down that food !
there go our rations .
there goes our water supply .
look out !
we might as well go down together , eh , Connie ?
- How am I doin &apos; , Willi ?
- Fine , Ritt ! fine !
you &apos;re a born accompanist .
you didn &apos;t make a single mistake , hardly .
Yeah , I know what you mean . right in here .
Yeah , that &apos;s it .
Ritt , you &apos;re a born accompanist .
we &apos;re all born accompanists .
&quot; how &apos;d I do , Willi ? &quot;
what are you laughing at , you silly goon ?
that &apos;s one for the book ... your book .
only , when you write it , they won &apos;t believe it .
our enemy ... our prisoner of war .
now , we &apos;re his prisoners , and he &apos;s gauleiter of the boat , singin &apos; German lullabies to us while he rows us to his supply ship and a concentration camp .
tell &apos; em , Willi ! tell &apos; em how funny it is .
that isn &apos;t funny . it &apos;s logical .
now that we &apos;ve been blown off our course , it would take us weeks to get to Bermuda .
certainly . it &apos;s perfectly logical . the supply ship was our only chance .
you know how I feel about that . I &apos;d rather take my chances with the sharks .
but he &apos;ll never make it .
without food and water , how long do you think he can keep on rowing like this ?
long enough , Mr Kovac , to reach my objective .
are you sure , Willi ?
maybe one of us should had better try to relieve him at the oars .
that &apos;s not necessary .
- Maybe I can take over for a while .
- Never mind , I &apos;ll row .
how can you keep on rowing , Willi , hour after hour ?
the rest of us can hardly lift an oar .
it &apos;s the master race . the Herrenvolk !
- Didn &apos;t you know , they can do anything ?
- I &apos;m beginning to believe it .
right living is what does it .
or , as the French say , &quot; Qui tôt se couche bien se porte . &quot;
Sacre bleu ! you speak French , also !
Yes , I spent some time in Paris .
Oh , yes .
tell me , Willi . why didn &apos;t you speak English when you first got on the boat ?
well , you see , I didn &apos;t know then whether I could trust you or not .
Wie geht &apos;s , Herr Schmidt ?
name is Smith !
all right , Mr Smith . how do you feel today ?
same as yesterday . thirsty !
well , steward , anything from the commissary yet ?
- Not even a nibble .
- Well , keep on trying .
if you catch some fish , you &apos;ll not only have food , but drink .
when you chew raw fish , there &apos;s always a little fresh water .
water .
there &apos;s that cloud .
what a day for a ball game .
St. Louis &apos;s the team to watch this year .
if we only had some bait .
- St. Louis &apos;s got hitters .
- It &apos;s been there all day .
Stan Musial &apos;s been cloutin &apos; &apos; em out .
how about Ty Cobb ? he &apos;s pretty good too .
- Got some A-1 pitchers .
- Yeah .
if the Dodgers only had a guy like Ernie Bonham , or even Johnnie Humphries .
Pittsburgh &apos;s the team to watch .
only 17 points below St. Louis .
if we beat the Pirates and St. Louis loses to Boston ...
- Hey , Kovac .
- Yeah ?
who do you think &apos;ll pitch for Pittsburgh today ?
I don &apos;t know ! I haven &apos;t been following the games much this season .
probably Wyatt for the Dodgers , Sewell for the Pirates .
Yeah . probably Sewell , Gus .
- I think , I &apos;ll take Rosie .
- Where to , Gus ?
Ebbets Field .
it &apos;s gonna be a good game this afternoon .
Ritt !
he &apos;s off the beam again .
well , Willi , how about another song , eh ?
certainly , my friend . what would you like to hear ?
you think you can remember &quot; Röslein auf der Heide &quot; ?
- Sure , sure ! which one was that ? - ♪ Dada-di-dadi-dada ...
Oh , yeah ! I know that one , all right ! now , wait a minute !
- All right !
- I got it !
- Ritt ? - Huh ?
- Do you know &quot; Treue Liebe &quot; ?
- You mean , uh , &quot; How can I leave ... &quot;
- That &apos;s right .
Stanley , why do you like to do that ?
- I don &apos;t know .
I can &apos;t sing anymore . makes me dry .
doesn &apos;t it look to you as if those clouds are darkening up ?
at the centre , a bit .
those really are rain clouds this time .
- I hope so . for Gus &apos;s sake . - That &apos;s right .
why don &apos;t you give me a break , Lu ?
the salt &apos;ll only make you thirstier .
you might just as well sip poison .
&quot; B.M. &quot; Her initials are larger than the others .
was she the last ... or the first ?
what was her name ?
so you won &apos;t talk , huh ?
where &apos;d you get the handcuff , Mrs Porter ?
you may call me Connie .
you did once during the storm , remember ?
you said , uh ...
&quot; we might as well go down together , eh , Connie ? &quot;
I liked the way you said &quot; Connie &quot; .
it was like a sock in the jaw .
tell me about the bracelet .
that was a dead giveaway , you know , darling , wanting us to die together like that .
dying together is even more personal than living together .
- What &apos;d you pay for the bracelet ?
- Nothing .
Barter ?
you &apos;re a low person , darling , obviously out of the gutter .
maybe that &apos;s why I &apos;m attracted to you .
- Maybe that &apos;s why you &apos;re attracted to me .
- Quit slumming .
funny part of it is , I &apos;m from the same gutter .
remember when you first got on the boat , you said , you used to work in the , uh — the packing house section in Chicago ?
well , I came from there too .
South Side ?
Ashland Avenue ... back of the yards .
and I lived there until I got this .
it worked miracles for me .
it took me from the , uh ... South Side to the North Side .
it was my passport ... from the stockyards to the Gold Coast .
it got me everything I wanted ... up to now .
quit slumming !
- How about a few hands , Ritt ? - Huh ? suits me fine .
- Do this up for me . - Connie , I &apos;ll fix it for you .
come on , Ritt .
- Kovac , how much do I owe you ? - Twelve thousand bucks .
merely temporary , my friend . I &apos;ll get it back .
- Deal &apos; em .
- Looks like bits of ice .
I wish they were .
they &apos;re really nothing but a few pieces of carbon , crystallized under high pressure at great heat .
quite so , if you want to be scientific about it .
I &apos;m a great believer in science .
like tears , for instance .
they &apos;re nothing but H2O with a trace of sodium chloride .
he likes you , but he hates the bracelet . you will have to get rid of it .
- The bracelet ?
- Mm-hmm .
I &apos;ve worn it for 15 years . it &apos;s brought me nothing but good luck .
he hates it .
I wouldn &apos;t take it off for anything or anybody in the world .
in the old days there was a place in Boston , Young &apos;s Hotel .
had the best restaurant in the world .
bet it wasn &apos;t any better than Henrici &apos;s Coffee House in Chicago .
or Bookbinder &apos;s in Philly ... that was food for you .
there , it &apos;s fixed ! in Munich , there is a place called Lorber &apos;s .
- Their specialty is pot roast .
- Pot roast .
young &apos;s used to have a menu , 150 pages long .
Yes , sir , 150 solid pages of eatments , and , oh , boy , what eatments !
ever eat in Antoine &apos;s in New Orleans ?
can &apos;t compare with Young &apos;s .
you never tasted such food in your life . especially seafood .
steamed clams dripping with melted butter , lobsters ...
lobsters à la Newburg with a special white wine sauce ...
- Ritt , shut up !
- What &apos;s wrong ?
stop jabbering about food !
isn &apos;t it enough we &apos;ve lost all our supplies through your carelessness ?
- Carelessness ?
- Yes , stupid , criminal carelessness !
but it wasn &apos;t me . I wasn &apos;t in charge of the food .
the commissary was Joe &apos;s job .
you dirty rat , trying to shift the blame onto Joe .
- Maybe it was my f —
- No , it wasn &apos;t !
you should have seen the storm coming !
my dear Connie , what &apos;s the matter with you ?
she &apos;s all right . just a little bit hungry .
what are you squawking about ? it &apos;ll make a swell chapter .
&quot; how It Feels to Be Starving &quot; , first-person , singular .
those are good things to write about , hunger and thirst .
if you really come from back of the yard ...
Kovac , why don &apos;t you kill Willi ?
why don &apos;t you cut his throat , like you said you would ?
I &apos;ll tell you why ! you &apos;re not strong enough !
the rest of us are just flesh and blood ... hungry flesh and blood , and thirsty !
for the love of Mike , will you throw that ratty cigar stub away ?
why should I ? does it annoy you ?
Yes , it makes me nervous , watching you chew on it all the time .
well , it makes me feel good .
Oh , you feel good , do you ? that &apos;s fine . fine !
Ritt , how much money are you worth ?
enough to buy and sell you a million times !
- How about raising the ante ?
- Anything you say .
- From now on , each stick is $ 100 .
- Anything you say .
- Deal &apos; em !
- Anything you ...
- How many factories do you own , Ritt ?
- What business is that of yours ?
I was just thinking . by the time we get home , I might own one of them .
bet a hundred .
raise a hundred .
- Stay .
- How many cards do you want ?
- Three .
- Three to you . three to the dealer .
think I &apos;ll go for one of your airplane plants .
I &apos;ve got ideas of my own about how to run a factory .
- Yeah , into the ground . - I &apos;ll have a labour-management committee .
we &apos;ll hold a meeting every week . and first —
are you trying to tell me how to run my own factories ?
not all of them , just the one I &apos;m gonna own .
- Bet a hundred .
- I &apos;ll see you ! queens .
kings .
you know , it &apos;s mighty funny how you keep winning all the pots .
I &apos;m a lucky guy .
well , just the same , I wish we had a new deck of cards .
give me another stack of chips .
- That &apos;s another thousand .
- Your deal .
- Sorry , Ritt .
- Cut you in ?
my credit still good ?
- Well , uh , your bracelet .
- No , thanks .
- What &apos;s the score ?
- $ 13,500 !
- How about raising the ante ?
- It &apos;s your funeral .
- Thousand dollars apiece ?
- Right .
okay .
I &apos;ll open for a thousand .
raise you two .
I &apos;ll raise you two .
call .
how many ?
two cards .
someday you &apos;ll learn , it doesn &apos;t pay to hold a kicker if you live long enough .
just to keep the pikers out .
- I &apos;ll bet five .
- Matched your kicker , huh ?
five &apos;s the bet .
put up ... or shut up .
and raise you five .
Kovac , now you &apos;re talking my language .
this is the moment I &apos;ve been waiting for .
I have got you over a barrel ... we &apos;ll do the bookkeeping later .
I &apos;ll see your five , and I &apos;ll raise you ... all the chips you &apos;ve got , plus all the money I owe you .
Kovac , looks as if you &apos;ve stepped out of your class this time .
see you , Rittenhouse . what have you got ?
I &apos;ve got ...
that was my pot . you couldn &apos;t possibly beat me .
- I have a full house .
- And I had four deuces .
how do I know you had four deuces ?
you ought to know . you made the cards , didn &apos;t you ?
and you marked &apos; em too !
they are crooked , and you are crooked !
- It &apos;s raining !
- It &apos;s raining !
- It &apos;s raining !
get the sail !
- Here .
- That &apos;s right .
I was at the wheel when she hit .
my watch was just about over ... and I was goin &apos; down for some hot java .
when she keeled over .
the siren was screamin &apos; .
like a human being , she was screamin &apos; .
right to the end .
Oh , you should &apos;ve heard the sound of the rain drumming &apos; on the canvas .
most beautiful sound you ever heard in your life .
I looked up .
a couple of drops fell right on my lips .
Hey , Joe !
what &apos;s the matter ?
why have you stopped playin &apos; ?
come on !
heat it up !
give it the Harry James !
gee , Rosie !
you &apos;re an armful . an armful of honey , that &apos;s what you are .
say , Rosie , I &apos;m thirsty .
how about a drink ?
set &apos; em up , Pete ! nice tall ones .
plenty of ice .
here &apos;s to you , Rosie baby .
what is it , Gus ?
Willi &apos;s got some water .
that &apos;s right , Gus .
I just had a tall one , plenty of ice .
sure , Gus ! sure !
- But Willi only had water .
- That &apos;s right .
uh , I guess , I &apos;ll get back to Rosie .
Willi , where &apos;d you get the water ?
- You &apos;ve been holdin &apos; out on us .
- You mustn &apos;t wake up the others .
they are tired .
well , what about you ?
- Ain &apos;t you tired ?
- No .
me neither .
I feel fine , except my right foot &apos;s asleep .
I can hardly feel it .
Willi , tell me .
do you think I should write to Rosie , tell her about it ?
or should I wait till I see her ?
wait till you see her .
Yeah , but ...
I can &apos;t walk in on her gimpy and all like this without no ...
warning , can I ?
I got to find some way to ... to break it to her gentle .
it &apos;ll be all right .
okay .
- So long , Willi .
- Good-bye , Gus .
I &apos;ll never forget what you done for me .
if there &apos;s anything I can ever do for you , just let me know .
there is something you can do for me .
remember , your name is Schmidt .
you like it better than Smith ?
much better !
- You &apos;d better hurry , Gus ! she &apos;s waiting .
- Okay .
- That water you was drinkin &apos; ...
- Rosie &apos;s waiting for you .
- Why didn &apos;t you share it with us ?
- Shh !
you mustn &apos;t wake them !
okay , Willi .
why don &apos;t you go after Rosie ?
she &apos;s waiting for you at Roseland ! there ! do you see the lights ?
help !
Stanley !
help !
Stanley ?
Stanley !
Willi , he &apos;s got ...
help !
- Where &apos;s Gus ?
- He &apos;s gone over .
- No use , Stan ...
- Gus !
- He went under .
- Gus !
Willi , what is it ? what &apos;s happened ?
Schmidt went over the side .
he was calling my name . that &apos;s what woke me .
you can &apos;t imagine how painful it was to me .
all night long , to watch him turning and suffering and nothing I could do for him .
why didn &apos;t you stop rowing ?
- Why should I ?
- To help him !
the best way to help him was to let him go .
I had no right to stop him , even if I wanted to .
a poor cripple dying of hunger and thirst ...
what good could life be to a man like that ?
he was trying to tell me something . if I could only remember !
he &apos;s better off now , out of his trouble .
- Something about water . - He was in agony from thirst .
I wanted to cry , but the tears wouldn &apos;t come .
no , how could they ?
if I remember rightly , tears are water with a trace of sodium chloride .
- Isn &apos;t that so , Willi ?
what about sweat ?
what &apos;s the chemical composition of sweat ?
water ... with a trace of something or other .
now , I remember !
Gus said , Willi had some water !
Yeah ! right under his shirt !
quite so .
I took the precaution of filling the flask from the water breakers before the storm , just in case of emergency .
and I had food tablets and energy pills too .
everybody on the U-boat has them .
you should be grateful to me for having the foresight to think ahead .
to survive , one must have a plan .
but there &apos;s nothing to worry about .
soon we &apos;ll reach the supply ship , and then we &apos;ll all have food and water .
- Too bad Schmidt couldn &apos;t have waited .
- You !
please , don &apos;t ... Please , Miss Alice !
to my dying day , I &apos;ll never understand Willi .
or what he did .
first , he tried to kill us all with his torpedoes .
nevertheless , we fished him out of the sea , took him aboard , shared everything we had with him .
you would &apos;ve thought , he &apos;d have been grateful .
all he could do was to plot against us .
then he ...
he let poor old Gus die of thirst .
what do you do with people like that ?
maybe one of us ought to try to row .
where to ?
what for ?
Nah !
when we killed the German , we killed our motor .
no ! we still got a motor .
eh ? who ?
Nah !
we &apos;re through .
are you afraid ?
no . I don &apos;t think so .
if we had got out of it , I ...
I was going to ask you to marry me .
what do you think you &apos;d have said ?
I think I would &apos;ve said , yes .
well , then , whatever happens ...
I &apos;d like you to marry me .
congratulations !
well , that &apos;s settled .
and what now , little men ?
I &apos;ve been a widower for 18 years .
we never had any children .
all I leave behind me is a great many millions of dollars .
I hope they do somebody some good .
so , we &apos;re all going to fold up and die , just because that ersatz superman is gone .
my only regret is that in the end
I joined a mob .
baloney !
we weren &apos;t a mob when we killed him .
we were a mob when we sat around , prisoners of the man we &apos;d saved , kowtowing to him , obeying him , practically heiling him , because he was kind enough and strong enough to take us to a concentration camp !
good grief , look at you !
Rittenhouse , C. J. Rittenhouse , self-made man .
made of what ?
as long as you &apos;re sitting there , thinking of your last will and testament ,
I &apos;ll write your epitaph for you now .
&quot; Ritt , he quit ! &quot;
that goes for you too , Narcissus !
it &apos;s a good thing there &apos;s room on your chest for another letter ... &quot; Q &quot; for quitter !
and you , Joe ...
it &apos;s all right for you to look up and trust in somebody .
how about giving him a hand ?
what &apos;s the matter with us ?
we not only let the Nazi do our rowing for us , but our thinking !
ye Gods and little fishes !
fishes !
ye Gods !
we haven &apos;t got energy pills , but the ocean &apos;s full of them .
millions of fish swimming around ! well , why don &apos;t we catch some ?
we tried that ! we have no bait !
sure , we have bait : by Cartier !
are you kidding ?
kidding , my foot ! I &apos;m starving !
well , what are you waiting around for ?
where &apos;s the fish line ?
bait your line , chum .
not only food , but oil .
we can squeeze the fish for oil . it &apos;s better than water .
I can recommend the bait . I ought to know . I bit on it myself !
I &apos;ve never eaten raw fish before .
I have . it &apos;s not bad .
we &apos;d better not count our chickens before they &apos;re hatched .
what do you mean , &quot; chickens &quot; ?
there never yet was a poor fish that wouldn &apos;t bite on one of those .
- Strike !
- It &apos;s a good one !
- Careful !
- Easy !
- Easy does it !
- Don &apos;t let him have slack !
- Easy !
- There &apos;s a ship .
- Huh ?
Gangway !
why , you ... My bracelet !
it &apos;s the supply ship , all right .
Yeah !
Willi &apos;s had the last word at that .
well , some of my best friends are in concentration camps .
do you suppose they &apos;ll have any coffee aboard ? real coffee ?
- Hello !
- What &apos;d he say ?
he says , yes , they have some coffee .
and Wiener schnitzel and pig &apos;s knuckles and sauerkraut and apple strudel — hot !
look ! the supply ship &apos;s signalling .
what &apos;s happening ? why are they turning around ?
maybe they forgot the cream for the coffee .
they &apos;re not going to pick us up ! Hey !
well , that &apos;s ... that &apos;s impossible .
they can &apos;t leave us here like this . why ... Why , that &apos;s inhuman .
as a matter of fact , it &apos;s a violation of international law .
- And now , there &apos;s a storm coming up .
- No , that &apos;s gunfire .
I think it would be a good idea to get out of here .
- Do you know I ...
you know , I believe that we &apos;re being shelled by our own side .
they &apos;re shooting at us !
what &apos;s the matter with them ? can &apos;t they see us ?
- Why can &apos;t we signal &apos; em or something ?
- With what ?
- Where are we going ?
what &apos;s the best place to go ?
she &apos;s moving towards us . hurry up , Kovac !
can &apos;t you boys row any faster ?
in a word , wow !
relax , Mr Rittenhouse !
- They &apos;ve got her !
watch your head !
- She &apos;s going down .
- And fast too !
not fast enough for me !
well , that settles the score .
here comes our ship . she ought to be here in about 20 minutes .
- What can we use to signal with ?
- Wait &apos;ll she gets a little nearer .
well , folks , we &apos;re in business agai ...
- There I go again .
well , I only hope Mrs Spencer hasn &apos;t been worrying too much .
- Who &apos;s Mrs Spencer ? - My wife .
George , you &apos;re married ?
those things happen to everybody , you know .
Twenty minutes ?
good heavens . my nails , my hair , my face !
Oh , I must look a fright !
Oh !
- Oh , here , darling .
- No , darling ! you first .
Yes , darling ! Yes ! &apos; cause one of my best friends is in the navy .
- Hmm , nice ! mighty nice !
- The boy goes to high school !
really ? what &apos;s his name ?
- George .
- Oh .
George Charles Spencer .
- Lovely family , George ! lovely family ! - Oh , thanks !
Stanley , do you realize , I don &apos;t even know your last name ?
G
- A- , double R- , E- , double T .
&quot; Garrett ! &quot; Garrett !
am I presentable , darling ? how do I look ?
- A million !
- Fifty grand .
Kovac , my boy , I owe you fifty grand .
- Forget that last hand , Ritt .
- I will never forget that last hand .
don &apos;t be silly , darling !
he &apos;ll find a way to take it off his income tax .
- Not at all ! not at all !
- And don &apos;t forget .
- You owe me a bracelet .
- Yows &apos;m !
- And a typewriter !
- Sure !
- And a camera !
- You bet !
and ... Look !
- Danke schön .
- It &apos;s his arm . let &apos;s get his coat off !
Hey , wait a minute ! have you forgotten about Willi already ?
Ritt , this is different ! the kid &apos;s wounded .
throw him back !
don &apos;t be silly , darling . he &apos;s ... He &apos;s helpless .
the baby has a toy .
- I should &apos;ve frisked him .
- You see ?
you can &apos;t treat them as human beings . you &apos;ve got to exterminate them !
easy , Ritt ! he &apos;ll be taken care of .
he says , &quot; Aren &apos;t you going to kill me ? &quot;
I &apos;ll have to tie this up till the ship &apos;s doctor takes care of it .
&quot; aren &apos;t you going to kill me ? &quot;
what are you gonna do with people like that ?
I don &apos;t know .
I was thinking of Mrs Higley and her baby .
and Gus .
well , maybe they can answer that .
&quot; ... murders being committed in our midst . &quot;
&quot; police inadequate . &quot;
&quot; we intend offering a substantial reward ...
&quot; to anyone , citizen or otherwise ...
&quot; who shall give information bringing the murderer ... or murderers to justice . &quot;
eh ! Blimey ! it &apos;s been rainin &apos; .
look at all them puddles . you mustn &apos;t be frightened by &apos; em .
ain &apos;t it a shame to break up the party ?
how about a song , Katie ?
sing that &quot; Ria &quot; all over again . ready ?
well done , Katie !
look out for Jack the Ripper .
don &apos;t let &apos; im get you , dearie .
I &apos;ll be all right . there are plenty of policemen about .
- Have you got far to go ?
- Only &apos; round the next corner .
very well . good night .
good night .
good night , Katie .
good night , all .
Hello . who are you ?
what do you want ?
it was the Ripper all right .
he done her the same way as the others .
they only just found her .
isn &apos;t it awful , what &apos;s happenin &apos; .
it &apos;s hardly more than a week since the last .
I saw &apos; im !
I saw the Ripper . he ran down the other alley .
- It must be him .
- Did you see his face ?
no . not in the dark .
like a shadow he was .
she &apos;s the fourth he &apos;s done &apos; round here .
right in the streets ... under your very noses .
special edition !
extra !
special edition !
Lord love me !
they &apos;ve seen him !
they seen the Ripper .
murder in White chapel !
murder !
the Ripper &apos;s been seen !
read about it !

amazing . another murder in the same district committed in the same way .
throat cut from behind . extraordinary .
- You have rooms to let ? - Hmm ?
I saw your advertisement , and the estate agents gave me this order to view .
well , you better come in .
we don &apos;t really make a habit of letting rooms , you know .
it just so happens , at the moment , we might be able to accommodate someone .
I &apos;ll call my wife .
- Ellen .
- Yes , darling ?
this gentleman has come about the , uh , advertisement .
- Oh . how do you do ?
- How do you do ?
the rooms are upstairs , Mr. , uh ...
my name is Slade .
Slade ?
how odd .
we have a Slade Walk at the corner of the square here .
now , if you &apos;ll come this way .
here we are .
my Aunt Sophie occupied this part of the house before she died .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;ll be very comfortable here .
- This is the bedroom .
- These are the only rooms you have ?
I &apos;m afraid so .
- There are the attics of course .
- Attics ? Mi-Might I see them ?
why , they &apos;re not very well furnished , but if you wish .
those are old-time actresses .
quaint , aren &apos;t they ?
my aunt &apos;s maid used these attics . this one is quite empty .
this one was used as a kitchen .
it &apos;s excellent .
this is excellent ... exactly what I need .
you see , I &apos;m a pathologist , a sort of medical scientist .
I wanted to find a place where I could study and do a little experimental work .
I &apos;d take the other rooms as well ... live in them and work up here .
- Would that be all right ?
- Of course .
this would be particularly useful ... because , occasionally , I require great heat .
would there be any objection to my moving in tonight ?
I don &apos;t even want to go out again . I have everything that I need .
we , uh ... We haven &apos;t discussed terms .
- Anything you suggest .
- Well , I thought , with meals and attention ...
- Five pounds a week ?
- Five ?
you &apos;ve no idea how much it means to me to find just the place I need .
it &apos;s such a relief .
and besides , you &apos;re not quite the usual landlady , are you ?
I think I should tell you why I want a paying guest here .
my husband was a tea broker in the City ... Mincing Lane .
not very long ago , he misinterpreted a commission ... and bought an entire shipment at the wrong price .
making good the loss has left us in rather low water .
so now you must let rooms .
he has income from a little entailed property ... so we still manage to keep our appearances .
but he &apos;d give anything to be in business again .
originally , my husband started business with a hundred pounds .
now , if I could get that much together again and hand it over to him ...
I &apos;m sure he &apos;d go into the City again as he did 20 years ago .
Oh , I understand completely .
we can &apos;t go on much longer as we have been .
he &apos;ll break up with nothing to do .
in fact , he &apos;s had a nervous breakdown .
so that times he seems a little eccentric ... or irritable or even rude towards you ...
I &apos;m sure you &apos;ll understand that , too , and excuse it .
why , of course .
in a way , these dreadful Jack the Ripper murders are a godsend .
he thinks and argues about them instead of moping .
this is like a refuge .
since I am going to move in now ...
I think I should pay you a month &apos;s rent in advance .
Twenty pounds .
I &apos;m afraid that my habits are irregular .
I often need to be out quite late at night .
but I &apos;ll use the back door into the mews so as not to disturb anyone .
just regard me as a lodger , not as a guest .
then you will hardly know that I &apos;m in the house .
whatever you wish . the maid will get your meals whenever you want them .
- You have a maid ?
- It happens to be her night out .
but I &apos;ll get you some supper .
you would like some supper , I expect .
Yes , I should . thank you .
this is a beautiful old Bible .
- It was my Aunt Sophie &apos;s .
- You &apos;ll leave it here ?
you &apos;d like to have it .
mine , too , are the problems of life ... and death .
murder in White chapel !
murder !
the Ripper &apos;s been at it again !
Ripper sensation ! read it in your paper !
Oh , it &apos;s you . I wondered why the door was open .
- Where have you been ?
- Where ... where have I been ?
I just slipped out . there &apos;s a new edition come up , you know .
I heard the newsboy shouting .
people are getting really alarmed .
especially women . he only does women , you know .
he cuts their throat , and then he ... uses his knife .
it &apos;s terrible .
they say the papers don &apos;t print all the details .
the frightening part about it is nobody knows why he does it ... or what he &apos;s like .
by the way , did you , uh , get rid of that fella ?
he &apos;s taken the rooms .
well , that means there &apos;s a stranger in the house .
we &apos;ll have no more privacy .
he &apos;ll be no trouble . we shall hardly know that he &apos;s in the house .
well , if you really want to do it .
I &apos;ve done it anyway .
all right , old girl .
now I must get him some supper .
- What , you mean he &apos;s already moved in ? - Mm-hmm .
well , what about references ?
but , Robert , he &apos;s a gentleman ... a kind of doctor , a pathologist .
he insisted on paying a month in advance .
besides , I &apos;m sure the agents would never send anyone who wasn &apos;t quite ...
I suppose I better make some sort of a show of welcoming him .
- Tomorrow will do , darling .
- Good .
well , if there &apos;s anything I can do for him .
I &apos;ve finished with this paper .
perhaps he might like to read the news .
I &apos;ve brought you some supper . may I come in ?
there was something peculiar about those pictures .
I don &apos;t suppose you ever noticed it , but wherever you went in this room ... the eyes of those women seemed to follow you about .
that can ... get on one &apos;s nerves .
Oh , I understand what you mean .
I &apos;ll have them taken down tomorrow .
and they &apos;re pictures of actresses .
I hope you don &apos;t really object to actresses ... because there &apos;s one in the house .
- My niece , Kitty .
- And she is on the stage ?
she &apos;s making a name for herself in the provincial music halls .
next week , she opens at the Theater Royal , Piccadilly , here , topping the bill .
she &apos;s brought over a dance from Paris .
it &apos;s very saucy , almost as daring as the cancan .
of course , Kitty doesn &apos;t intend to stay in the music halls .
later on , she hopes to get into musical comedy .
then she &apos;ll have half the men in London at her feet .
&quot; behold , there met him a woman , subtle of heart . &quot;
Oh , I don &apos;t think Kitty &apos;s especially subtle .
you &apos;ll find her very clever and charming .
wait till you see her . you &apos;ll change your mind about actresses .
the four-wheeler &apos;s coming , sir .
- Here &apos;s the pass I promised you .
- To tell you the truth , sir ...
I don &apos;t fancy walking home alone from the theater late at night ... even for Miss Kitty ... not with all the papers saying it &apos;s about time for the Ripper to do another .
he &apos;s never killed anybody up this way .
- He can always decide to open up new ground .
come along , darling .
you &apos;re going to have plenty of time ?
you &apos;ve got everything ?
- Everything &apos;s at the theater .
- I &apos;m sorry . I &apos;m fussing .
I shouldn &apos;t . you look very smart .
you don &apos;t look half-bad yourself. my dear .
- Are you ready for it ?
- I &apos;d better be . it &apos;s my big night .
Mr. Slade , you haven &apos;t yet met my niece , Kitty Langley .
- How do you do ? - &quot; The woman &apos; subtle of heart . &quot;
you must admit she really is rather charming .
Oh . are you coming to the theater too ?
I have a pass here if you can use it .
no . I &apos;m afraid I have work that I must do .
then you won &apos;t be in to dinner , sir ?
no . I may be out late , quite late .
until the early hours of the morning .
I warned you of my irregular habits .
you have been out rather late once or twice .
didn &apos;t I hear you two nights ago ?
it was past 1 : oo in the morning .
- What do you do out so late ?
- You hardly ever go out in the day , do you ?
I enjoy the streets at night ... when they &apos;re empty .
- You mean you just walk about ?
- Sometimes .
sometimes I go down to the Thames .
I ... like the river .
- I do , too , on a sunny day .
- I like it in a different way .
have you ever held your face close to the water ... and let it wash against your hands as you look down into it ?
deep water is dark ... and restful ... and ... full of peace .
but ...
I mustn &apos;t delay you .
I hope your debut is successful .
thank you .
why don &apos;t you go out by the front door ?
I prefer the back door . I ... always use it .
good night .
he &apos;s a curious fellow .
- A very curious fellow .
- Kitty . Kitty , we &apos;ll be late .
now that you &apos;ve no dinner to get to , Daisy , you &apos;ve no excuse for missing the performance .
come to my dressing room afterwards . I &apos;ll send you home in a cab .
- How &apos;s that ?
- Oh , bless you , miss !
I &apos;ll be clapping me hands off for you , miss .
thank you , Daisy .
- Piccadilly Theatre Royal .
- Right you are , sir .
you fascinate him , you know .
he can &apos;t take his eyes off you .
I found him interesting in a way .
well , I could do without him about the house .
something a bit ... odd about him , don &apos;t you think ?
lots of people seem odd to other people at times , dear .
I thought somehow he seemed a little lost .
I believe that &apos;s because he &apos;s lonely , darling .
here you are , ladies . Montague Square , ladies .
step out , please . mind your step , dear .
t &apos;s a little bit wet .
look after your self now .
here you are , sir . Aldgate and White chapel .
thank you , sir . there &apos;s plenty of room inside , sir .
evening Standard . echo .
coppers on the watch at White Hart .
thank you . evening Standard . echo .
coppers on ...
thank you , sir .
evening Standard . echo .
thank you .
now , listen a minute , Charlie .
I &apos;m not going to have you annoying Miss Langley .
five and sixteen . all right , laddie .
don &apos;t I always come back when someone new is using my old dressing room ?
I can &apos;t let you in .
we &apos;ll come &apos; round afterwards .
- Good-bye , darling .
- Miss Langley . good evening , sir .
word &apos;s going around there &apos;ll be royalty in the house .
- We don &apos;t know who it is yet .
- Royalty .
- That &apos;s wonderful , Kitty .
- I must go and tell the girls .
bless you .
- Good luck .
- Good luck , darling .
Miss . you know me .
I &apos;m Annie Rowley ... &quot; La Belle Anne . &quot;
- Look here , Annie .
- It &apos;s all right , Charlie . I know Annie .
you want to see your old dressing room , don &apos;t you ?
come on .
here we are , Annie .
you got a nice lot of flowers ... more than I had when I opened when the theater was new .
- Did you have this room for long ?
- They didn &apos;t take to me .
I remember the night I looked in that mirror before I went on .
I looked at myself , and I wondered how I &apos;d go over .
I didn &apos;t go over .
having talent isn &apos;t enough . you &apos;ve got to have luck too .
I broke my luck . I whistled to myself before I went on .
something bad always happens if you whistle in the dressing room .
- Oh , Annie .
- It &apos;s an old superstition .
all right , Annie dear . I shan &apos;t whistle .
your luck &apos;s all right , and you &apos;ve got real looks too .
I saw you at the Grand Theatre , Woolwich , a couple of months ago .
- They &apos;re going to love you here .
- I hope so .
this is me .
- Are you going to be out front tonight , Annie ?
- No .
it would break my heart to see you gettin &apos; what I never got .
besides , a nephew of mine was married this morning ... and I said I &apos;d get back to the party .
- Oh , I didn &apos;t come for that , miss .
- Take it , please .
a golden sovereign . Oh , miss .
have you heard the news ?
they &apos;re putting flowers in the royal box .
Oh , I &apos;m so excited !
I don &apos;t know what to do .
I &apos;ve just heard , sir , there &apos;s been another Ripper murder .
Kitty , congratulations from all of us . here &apos;s to you .
here &apos;s to you .
thank you .
thank you , Marjorie , Betty , Jane , all of you .
coming from you , this ... this means more than all the applause in the world .
excuse me , sir . there &apos;s a gentleman to see Miss Kitty .
he says he &apos;s from Scotland Yard .
I &apos;m sorry , sir , but it &apos;s essential that I see Miss Langley immediately .
Kitty .
very lovely , if may say so , sir .
you may say so , Bates .
- You &apos;re a policeman , Mr. Warwick ?
- Inspector Warwick , miss .
I must apologize for this intrusion ... but I came here directly from White chapel .
you had a woman here earlier ... Annie Rowley .
she told some of her friends how generous you &apos;d been . that &apos;s what led me to you .
Miss Langley , were you well-acquainted with her ?
not particularly . everybody in the theater knows her .
- What is all this ?
- I know . Jack the Ripper &apos;s got her .
she stood right where you &apos;re standing now .
why would the Ripper want to go after anyone like her ?
I don &apos;t know .
it &apos;s funny she should have sent this .
you know , I ... I almost don &apos;t like to touch it .
- It came just a little while ago .
- It &apos;s ever so pretty .
that must have cost Annie half a sovereign to have made up .
we formed a cordon . the alarm spread through the district , but we couldn &apos;t trace him .
are the mutilations repeated ?
Oh , this is Dr. Sheridan , the theater doctor .
Oh , yes . Yes , he used his knife pretty extensively .
they don &apos;t call him the Ripper for nothing .
my beliefs that he &apos;s a man of considerable medical knowledge .
Oh , I &apos;m sure of it .
it &apos;s proved by the deadly nature of his assaults .
in the last case , his first stroke cut ... the sternocleidomastoid muscle clean through .
and his second stroke divided the ensiform cartilage .
does anybody know why he commits these murders ?
the Ripper must have a motive ... but no man alive can even guess at what it might be .
and the women who could know are dead .
have you discovered anything yourself ... any clues to him ?
one rather odd thing .
each of the murdered women was at one time or another on the stage .
why doesn &apos;t somebody shoot him ?
it &apos;s against the law for anyone to use firearms , even the police .
and we all get so jumpy down there .
- We &apos;d likely be banging away at one another .
- That &apos;ll do , Bates .
- Did anybody see him this time ?
- Some of our men thought they saw him .
they couldn &apos;t describe him clearly , but , uh ... they swear that he was carrying a small black bag .
it says here , &quot; The bag appeared to be made of shiny black oil cloth ... &quot;
&quot; and was the sort of bag that doctors always use to carry their tools or their dinner ... and was of a size convenient to conceal the Ripper &apos;s long knife . &quot;
well , what &apos;s the matter ?
Robert .
silly , isn &apos;t it , but I was thinking ... that Mr ....
Mr. Slade came here the night of the other murder .
and all he had with him was a little black bag .
and he took the bag with him when he went out last night .
- He did not .
- But he did , dear .
his bag was not black , and he didn &apos;t have it with him last night .
- Would you stake your oath on that ... your solemn oath in a court of law ?
not only was his bag not black , but you &apos;re not even sure that he had it with him .
he wasn &apos;t home but past 3 : 00 this morning . I heard him creeping up the stairs .
naturally he crept up the stairs . what do you expect him to do , dance and sing ?
do you want him to wake the whole house , do you ?
you don &apos;t even read the news ... and you sit there working up the most illogical and preposterous suspicions .
police .
all right , Daisy . I &apos;ll go .
- Good morning .
- Good morning , sir . good morning , madam .
I &apos;m sorry to trouble you so early , but , uh , it &apos;s rather important .
well , come in , but don &apos;t leave your bobbies standing on my doorstep .
- All right . keep moving , Bates .
- Very good , sir .
well , what are you doing here , Mr. Warwick ?
I &apos;ve been reading all about myself and the gentleman with the black bag .
did you know that poor woman sent me some flowers to the theater last night ?
sort of a good-luck horseshoe .
that was my excuse for calling .
- Good morning , darlings .
- Morning , my dear .
I didn &apos;t see that till after you &apos;d left .
the stage doorkeeper told the local constable about it , and he reported it to us .
I want to find out what florist it came from .
we brought the horseshoe home if you &apos;d like to look at it .
thank you for a lovely breakfast , Daisy . would you like to see those , darling ?
we &apos;re tying to trace her movements after she left you .
- Here it is . it &apos;s roses and London pride .
- Hmm . here &apos;s the box it came in , sir . the name &apos;s on the lid .
I must have this address .
Mr. Slade , he &apos;s going out very early this morning .
he &apos;s not going out . he &apos;s coming in here .
Oh , I beg your pardon .
Mr. Slade , I haven &apos;t even started to get your breakfast .
- Good morning .
- Good morning .
I just came down to get the paper .
- Oh , uh , Mr. Warwick , this is Mr. Slade .
- How do you do ?
Mr. Warwick &apos;s from Scotland Yard . he &apos;s engaged on the Ripper case .
my men are hanging around tying to get a look at Miss Langley .
your opening performance went well ?
- Tremendously well .
- We had royalty there .
- Must have been very gratifying .
- When are you coming to see the show ?
Mr. Slade doesn &apos;t care for the theater , dear .
but why not ?
I must insist on you coming some evening very soon .
haven &apos;t you enough men at your feet already ?
I didn &apos;t intend to intrude . if I could have a paper .
Oh , uh , they &apos;ve seen the Ripper again .
- I don &apos;t think you &apos;ll ever catch him .
- Why not ? white chapel was swarming with police , and yet you haven &apos;t come near laying a hand on him .
you don &apos;t know any more about him now than you did in the beginning .
- We have our theories though .
- Theories ?
the favorite one is that he &apos;s a maniac and kills at random .
- Do you think that ?
- No , I don &apos;t .
well , he &apos;s a bit of a back-alley specialist , if you ask me .
he never goes after women unless they &apos;re alone and undefended .
some of us are inclined to believe that , uh ... he has a grudge against a particular woman .
when he finds her , then the murders will cease .
- Do you believe that ? - Mm-mmm .
what is your theory about him then ?
well , if you &apos;d care to come to Scotland Yard sometime ...
I &apos;d be very happy to explain it to you .
if my ideas are right , I &apos;ll make Jack the Ripper &apos;s own fingers tie the noose that &apos;ll hang him .
I don &apos;t know what you mean by that , but there &apos;s a new clue here .
&quot; Ripper . man with bag wanted . &quot;
Yes , they &apos;re very excited about that .
if you &apos;ll excuse me , I have some things to do .
one afternoon next week , I &apos;ll show you our Black Museum .
- I shall be most interested .
- Good-bye .
- Good-bye , Mr. Warwick .
- Good-bye .
Oh , Daisy , if that &apos;s Mr. Slade &apos;s breakfast , I &apos;ll take it up .
Mr. Slade !
what &apos;s burning up there ?
don &apos;t come up here .
I &apos;m sorry if there &apos;s an odor , but there was something I had to do .
I &apos;ll open the window . just leave the tray , if you please .
- Robert .
- Uncle .
- We &apos;ve looked all over the house for you .
- Where have you been ?
uh , I went out . I &apos;ve just come in .
we &apos;ve something to tell you .
Mr. Slade has burned his bag .
I smelled burning . I didn &apos;t say anything to you at the time .
when I heard him go to his room , I went up to the attic .
and this is what I found .
it was in the refuse pail . he was out half last night .
then he saw this morning &apos;s headlines and burned his bag .
- Very sensible of him .
- Why do you say that ?
nobody can afford to own a bag like that now .
look here . a man was mobbed in Trafalgar Square this morning .
they nearly had his life just because he was carrying a small black bag .
that sort of thing &apos;s going on all over London .
I came straight home when I read about it , because I remembered ...
I had a small black bag of that sort .
so I hid it .
anyone who even owns one is under suspicion .
that &apos;s why he tried to get rid of his just as I &apos;ve hidden mine .
- It &apos;s the only sensible thing to do .
- Frightening myself like this .
you &apos;re all worked up . I &apos;ll get you a glass of sherry , old girl .
your uncle &apos;s right , of course .
we really know very little about Mr. Slade .
he &apos;s coming down .
- Good afternoon .
- You &apos;re going out early , Mr. Slade .
Yes . I &apos;ve just completed an experiment .
I must test it . - Where do you do that ?
- It would be where you work , I suppose .
Yes . at the University Hospital .
you will excuse me , won &apos;t you ?
- The University Hospital .
- That &apos;s in Gower Street .
I wonder if he really works there .
it &apos;s near my hairdresser &apos;s , and I &apos;m going there now .
- Charlie .
- Good afternoon , sir .
excuse me . who was it that just went in ?
- One of the doctors , miss .
- I thought I recognized him .
he works down in the path lab .
very pleasant gent indeed , ma &apos;am .
- Has he worked here long ?
- Oh , quite some time now .
he , uh , works here off and on , if you know what I mean , miss .
he ain &apos;t what I &apos;d call one of our regulars .
Oh , there you are , sir . the lady was just askin &apos; about you .
- I thought I saw you go in a moment ago .
- Why , Miss Langley .
- I had an appointment next door .
- You followed me .
- Do you expect to be followed ?
- No , but ...
but I know that I arouse curiosity .
I &apos;ve become so absorbed in my work that I ... sometimes forget what people may think .
I &apos;ve been asked to move several times because I was no longer welcome .
I so hoped to remain on at your house in Montague Square ... until my work was finished .
but there &apos;s no thought of your leaving .
- I rather feel your Aunt Ellen ...
- She had too much excitement last night .
these dreadful Ripper murders are playing on her imagination .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;ll find her quite normal by tea time .
then you don &apos;t feel that she wants me to go somewhere else ?
but of course not . we &apos;d miss you .
see you at home .
Mr. Slade .
your tea .
Kitty &apos;s making a real success .
she &apos;s been asked to open the new Palace of Varieties in White chapel High Street .
they are going to have a music hall there ?
they were going to postpone the opening .
then they decided that would look as though they were afraid of Jack the Ripper .
Mr. Slade , I ...
I think Kitty would like it ... if you overcame your prejudices and saw the show .
she dances wonderfully , and Kitty really does look very beautiful .
Solomon says , &quot; A strange woman lieth in wait , as for prey . &quot;
she increases transgressors among men . &quot;
women of the theater ... actresses ... they &apos;re powdered and painted to look beautiful .
I can show you something more beautiful than a beautiful woman .
something much more beautiful .
I had a brother , and he was a genius .
and I loved him very dearly .
here &apos;s a portrait he painted of himself .
isn &apos;t that a wonderful face ?
look at that remarkable brow ... lofty .
see the life in those eyes . they &apos;re fine and clear .
there &apos;s a sensitivity about his lips .
you &apos;re looking at the work of a genius .
it &apos;s as real as though he were alive .
I can almost hear his voice again when I look at this .
isn &apos;t that a marvelous piece of work to come from the hands of a man ?
- A young man .
- Oh , it is marvelous .
but how peculiar to paint so small .
he must have had wonderful eyes .
he had strange eyes .
he was a strange man .
and he died ?
I &apos;m sorry .
he need not have died .
he need not have died .
those are the death masks of various murderers ... some of whom were publicly hanged outside Newgate Jail .
you can see the rope marks on their necks .
and , uh , over there are the ropes that were actually used ... to hang some of these men .
everything here at our Black Museum ... has figured at some time or other in a celebrated crime .
- What &apos;s this shovel ?
- Oh , that was used to , uh ... buy a couple of corpses in a little chicken run in the Hackney Marshes Murder .
how awful .
- Um , Miss Langley .
- Yes , Inspector ?
I have a question to ask you .
- Only one , Inspector ?
- Just one for now .
- I have dozens to ask you .
- Really ?
for instance ... what &apos;s this chopper for ?
that was used by the Clark twins to kill Herbert Thompson in the Tufnell Park Murder .
uh , Miss Langley , would you come on Friday for tea at my mother &apos;s ?
I &apos;d like her to meet you .
what &apos;s that cup ?
that belonged to Mrs. Gately . she disposed off our heavily insured husbands .
- With a cup ?
- She put poison in their tea .
- Will you come ?
- And what &apos;s this , Inspector ?
Oh , some poor chap beat his sweetheart to death with this .
- Why did he do it ?
- Well , we &apos;ve never known exactly ... but my belief this moment is that she failed to answer some perfectly simple question .
in that case , Inspector , I &apos;ll come to tea on Friday .
thank you , Miss Langley .
and , uh , here are the fingerprint charts .
Ah . I wanted to present my compliments to our distinguished visitor .
- Miss Langley .
- How do you do ?
this is Sir Edward Willoughby , the commissioner of Police .
I &apos;ve just been to the palace about the Ripper murders .
I don &apos;t think I want to go through an interview like that again .
her Majesty knows that the papers say another may be due .
have you estimated when it might occur ?
he says he can predict the time of each murder .
there &apos;s a strange periodicity to the Ripper &apos;s crimes .
four murders each within 10 to 12 days .
well , we know they happen regularly .
it &apos;s as though the desire of the Ripper to kill surges to a peak ... he &apos;s satisfied , and then he &apos;s quiet until the impulse returns .
when do you think he &apos;ll do another ?
the night after tomorrow .
very good , Jennie .
here , have one on the house .
- Thanks , I will .
- There you are , me girl .
did you see Kitty Langley often to imitate her that way ?
- Only once .
- Good , ain &apos;t she ?
- Hello , Jennie .
- Hello , Wiggy .
you wouldn &apos;t like to lend me that concertina , would ya ?
why ?
what do you want it for ?
play hymns down the White chapel High Street .
- Good health , mate .
- Cheer-o .
have you given up picking &apos; pockets , Wiggy ?
had to . the Ripper &apos;s brought too many of you coppers down here .
I can make enough for a whole week playing hymns .
and I &apos;ll bring it back in the morning . that &apos;s a promise .
well , if you want it that bad , here you are .
Ah !
Lord love ya , Jennie .
here , outside if you &apos;re gonna play that thing .
out you get .
here , I ought to be movin &apos; too .
- Toodle-oo .
- Ta-ta , Jennie .
plenty of cops about tonight , ain &apos;t they ?
Yes . I &apos;ve never seen so many .
thanks for lending me this .
- Well , see ya bring it back .
that &apos;s all . - I will , first thing .
- Good night .
- Good night , Wiggy .
- Have you seen Jennie lately ?
- Oh , she &apos;s a good sort .
she lent me this . she just went in . Aye .
there &apos;s a smoking concert at the Red Lion next Tuesday night , you know .
maybe she could sing a few songs for them .
- She needs work ever so badly . - Aye .
I &apos;ll go right now and see her about it .
Oh !
Oh , God .
Jennie . Whoa there , Bob .
Jennie . Aye , there.Jennie .
Oh , my !
there &apos;s been a murder !
police ! police !
for the love of Mike !
police !
it was the Ripper all right .
- Did you see anyone come out after she came in ?
- Nobody came out , sir .
then he must still be about .
- Form a cordon around here .
- Stand men shoulder to shoulder .
- Don &apos;t let anyone pass .
- Search these buildings .
he must be around here someplace !
they don &apos;t seem to find &apos; im .
I don &apos;t see how he could &apos;ve got away .
that &apos;s the other side of White chapel .
the Ripper &apos;s got away .
- Mr. Slade , what are you doing ?
- Burning my ulster .
please , don &apos;t come too near .
are those stains on it ?
it ... became contaminated ... in a pathological laboratory .
I have to be drastic , or the contamination would spread .
you mean , it may carry a disease ?
the stove in my room wasn &apos;t big enough . that &apos;s why I made the fire in here .
I have to destroy this completely .
I smelled burning , and I came ... Oh .
I should have closed the kitchen door .
then perhaps the odor wouldn &apos;t have spread through the house .
- That &apos;ll wake everyone in the house .
- I &apos;m sorry .
well , it &apos;s done .
there &apos;s no danger now ?
- No .
- You thought about the risk to us .
- But what about yourself ?
- I &apos;ll be all right .
- Are you sure ?
- Yes .
I &apos;ll open the window and let some of the smoke out .
it &apos;s almost daylight , and here &apos;s the milkman .
Hello , mate . heard about the Ripper ? Yes .
he was up to his old tricks again last night .
they told me they practically copped him , but he got away .
what &apos;s the news , son ? boy .
throw the paper down here .
thank you .
- We should go to the police .
- What , and scandalize the whole neighborhood ?
we &apos;ve very little to go on when you consider it calmly .
- Robert , Kitty saw the stains .
- But I told you what they were .
you get ideas out of reading the papers .
remember how excited and upset you were over that bag ?
well , you were wrong , weren &apos;t you ?
has it occurred to you that he might have been telling the truth ?
he &apos;s a medical man , and he &apos;d know the danger if his coat was contaminated .
he was protecting us .
I believe you ought to be thanking him instead of suspecting him .
- Well , perhaps you &apos;re right .
- Of course I am .
now I &apos;m going to run along and get a little more sleep .
well , I &apos;ve always said he &apos;s a very eccentric fellow .
Robert , I think we must make certain ... that Kitty &apos;s never left alone in the house with him .
just for safety &apos;s sake .
you &apos;ll look exquisite wearing that , dear .
Oh , these flowers came from the florist &apos;s a little while ago .
our carriage will have an escort of mounted police .
is John arranging that ?
by a very funny coincidence , a squad will be going to White chapel for duty ... and we &apos;re going that way too .
Oh , I don &apos;t think I like this . where &apos;s Daisy ?
she went out after giving Mr. Slade his tea .
- I put a note on his tray . - What ?
it was just a reminder about the opening at the new Palace tonight .
- Oh , no . this will never do .
- It looks a bit overdone . what &apos;ll I do ?
I have to have some flowers for the opening .
I know . a posy . how long will Daisy be ?
she &apos;ll be rather late , I &apos;m afraid . I &apos;ll take it .
- Would you , darling ? - Of course .
this hat has given you very good service , sir .
- Yes . there &apos;s a bit of a dent here .
- Oh .
- I can get that out , sir .
- Thank you .
you &apos;re going to the opening of Miss Kitty tonight , I take it , sir .
I wouldn &apos;t fancy going down to White chapel myself . sir .
that &apos;s safe enough . you &apos;ll let me have it around about an hour ?
- I &apos;ll get it up very special , sir .
- Thank you .
- Good day , sir . - Good day to you , sir .
Robert . I didn &apos;t know you had come out .
I just stepped &apos; round to Harris &apos;s with my hat .
- Where &apos;s Daisy ?
- She &apos;s shopping .
- Then Kitty &apos;s in the house alone .
- She wanted this bouquet altered .
- I thought you were in the bedroom .
- I &apos;m getting back .
you didn &apos;t mind my sending up the little note , did you ?
I was glad to have it . I came down to thank you .
are you able to go to the theater ?
I &apos;m not sure yet .
I guarantee you the rest of the show will be good .
I have some passes . I &apos;ll get you one .
won &apos;t you sit down ?
I expect that many men have told you that you &apos;re very beautiful .
Oh . well , I don &apos;t always believe them .
my brother could have captured your beauty ... for all time .
your brother , he was an artist , wasn &apos;t he ?
he was a genius .
it was the beauty of women that led him to his destruction .
yours is a beauty which could destroy men .
Oh , is that a compliment ?
or it could destroy you .
have you ever thought of that ?
that &apos;s a very queer thing to say . besides that , I don &apos;t think I &apos;m beautiful at all .
I , uh , take great trouble to give that impression .
it is one thing if a woman is beautiful merely for herself .
but when she exhibits the loveliness of her body upon the stage ... as a lure , leading men on ...
Oh , you are prejudiced against actresses , aren &apos;t you ?
you wouldn &apos;t think that anyone could hate a thing ... and love it too .
you can &apos;t love and hate at the same time .
you can , and it &apos;s a problem then .
I take my problems to the river ... because water is soothing when it runs dark and deep .
and a man can think .
the water answers problems , you know ?
you sound lonely .
and the answer is ... that a man can destroy what he hates ... and love what he destroys .
I also know that there is evil in beauty .
but if the evil is cut out ...
Hello , Uncle .
we &apos;ve been having a most interesting conversation .
Mr. Slade is quite a philosopher .
- I do hope you &apos;ll be able to come this evening .
- Thank you .
I &apos;ll look forward to seeing you in White chapel .
you can dismount your men .
come in , my boy . we &apos;ve been watching for you .
is that you , John ?
I shan &apos;t be long .
- Plenty of time .
- Did you remember to bring my escort ?
Yes , the square &apos;s full of mounted police .
and in another moment , he might have had his hands on her .
did Kitty realize what was happening ?
she didn &apos;t seem to , and we haven &apos;t told her anything .
with a performance tonight , we didn &apos;t even want her to think there was anything wrong .
it &apos;s an accumulation of little things , one on top of the other .
destroying his bag , burning his ulster , staying up all night .
I think this thing can be settled right away .
here &apos;s a fingerprint the Ripper left in White chapel ... then again in Mitre Square .
if it were possible for me to see something Mr. Slade had held in his right hand ... a glass or something of that sort ...
has Daisy taken his toddy up yet ?
he always has a hot drink about now .
- Lemon and spices , a sort of appetizer .
- She &apos;s preparing it now .
if you took it up and waited to bring the glass down ...
Yes .
Yes ?
we have a little excitement outside .
they &apos;re waiting for Kitty . she &apos;ll be leaving in a few minutes .
I &apos;m going out too . I shan &apos;t be in for dinner tonight .
Oh , do you like my new ulster ?
Oh , yes . if you don &apos;t mind , I &apos;ll wait to take down the glass .
if I seem a little excited tonight ... you &apos;ll understand why .
if you &apos;ve ever worked ...
for a long time ... long and dangerously ... you &apos;ll know how it feels when you believe ... that in a little while ... in a little while , you &apos;ll finish what you have to do .
you &apos;re referring to your work ?
- Yes .
- You mean you &apos;re going away ?
of course I &apos;ll let you know ... if I can .
I rather think I may .
you &apos;ll let me know if you , uh ...
Oh , yes .
- He used his right hand ?
- Yes .
- You sure you didn &apos;t touch it ?
- I didn &apos;t .
that &apos;s fine .
it &apos;s nice and clear .
- Are you sure he used his right hand ?
- Quite sure .
turn it over , will you ?
well , you needn &apos;t worry about Mr. Slade anymore .
- These prints don &apos;t match .
- Then it wasn &apos;t him .
- Can &apos;t be .
- John , why must it be his right hand ?
obviously this print couldn &apos;t possibly have been made by the Ripper &apos;s left hand .
it couldn &apos;t , eh ?
not unless every detective at the Yard is wrong .
I wonder if we could be .
- Daisy , where &apos;s everybody ?
- That &apos;s Kitty .
I &apos;ve got to think this out . could you go ahead with Kitty , and we &apos;ll follow ?
if you don &apos;t mind staying behind for a few minutes .
I &apos;m ready , everybody.John .
my men outside are going to think that you were well worth waiting for .
thank you .
Mr. Slade doesn &apos;t want dinner , so you take a bus to the theater and come home in the carriage .
- Honest , ma &apos;am ? I can get a bus on the corner .
- Good .
all ready now . we &apos;ll follow in a few minutes .
- Oh , aren &apos;t you coming with us ?
- We have something we want to talk about .
I &apos;m awfully sorry .
we &apos;ll follow almost immediately . they &apos;re waiting for you .
the Ripper used his knife from right to left , across the throat ... like a left-handed man .
we never let it come out that the Ripper was left-handed .
if he were left-handed ... Stand up a minute .
then he would take his victim like this , you see ... and the cut of his knife would start on this side , from here .
now , turn around .
if the Ripper faced his victims instead of taking them from behind ... then he &apos;d have to use his right hand to make that kind of cut ... and it would be his left hand that made the prints I found .
you going out , sir ?
you might just as well have used the front door instead of coming this way .
- I &apos;ll light you out .
- Are you going to the theater , Daisy ?
Yes , sir . I &apos;m just off to catch a bus .
Daisy .
I want you to have this .
- You &apos;ve been very good , looking after me .
- Oh , thank you , sir .
thanks ever so .
it &apos;s you , sir .
- Was that Mr. Slade ? - Yes , sir .
he just went out the back way .
- All right . you go along . I &apos;ll lock up .
- Thank you , sir .
- Good-bye , sir .
- Good-bye .
- White chapel High Street ?
- Right-o , miss .
all the way to White chapel . hop in .
what &apos;s that ?
- Found something ?
- I can &apos;t be sure .
this powder &apos;s so coarse , I can &apos;t see the ridges and characteristics clearly .
somehow I &apos;ll get clear prints of his left hand .
I wonder if there &apos;s anything else here . let &apos;s take a look at that .
- Locked , I suppose .
- Yes .
that &apos;s the picture Ellen spoke to me about . his brother painted it .
I &apos;ve seen a miniature like this before .
I think we have something here . come on .
- Do you mind going on to White chapel alone ?
- Why ?
I want to look in at the Yard . I &apos;ll follow as soon as possible .
when you get to the theater , stay close to Kitty .
I found this picture in Slade &apos;s room , Superintendent .
it &apos;s of his brother . you remember the first Ripper murder ?
- Lizzie Turner , last August .
- She had a sweetheart .
the one who died of drink or something ?
after the murder , I found this picture in her room . Slade &apos;s brother again .
I picked it up at the Black Museum on my way here .
that &apos;s as he used to be , and this one is the same man , also painted by himself ... only he degenerated , dragged down by Lizzie and her kind .
Slade killed Lizzie because she ruined his brother .
but this doesn &apos;t prove that Slade is Jack the Ripper .
but it &apos;s sufficient grounds for action . Slade is deranged .
he believes he &apos;s doing right to rid the world of the kind of woman ... that brought his brother to this ... and I &apos;m pretty sure he &apos;s in the theater somewhere .
if you spot anyone like him , Inspector Warwick will come and identify him .
I &apos;m sure he &apos;s in the theater somewhere .
be quick and quiet and report back here . move along now .
are you tired of life ?
are you bored with your wife ?
is a laugh really out of the question ? oui ?
then I take you with me , and we go to Paris .
may I ?
- No sign of him , sir .
- Nobody answering that description , sir .
- We drew a blank , sir .
- It was a false alarm . - Anybody else report ?
- No .
then I better get backstage . her number &apos;s just ended .
one more , Miss Langley .
- Wonderful show , Miss Langley . wonderful . - Thank you .
- You really were wonderful .
- Oh , there &apos;s John .
- Ah , hello , John .
- I &apos;m sorry I &apos;m so late . never mind .
I want to change and see the rest of the program .
will you wait for me ?
I said I &apos;d be here .
I promised I would be here if I could .
- But the others are taking me home . - I &apos;m not going home .
I &apos;m going away , and I &apos;m going to take you with me .
but ...
but I want to see the rest of the show , and ... and I &apos;ll have to change .
so if you &apos;ll wait outside ...
I shan &apos;t be very long .
you &apos;re so exquisite .
you &apos;re always so complimentary .
more wonderful than anything I &apos;ve ever known .
why don &apos;t you sit here ?
we can talk while I change behind the screen .
I can &apos;t lose you now .
it is such lovely women as you who drag men down .
we &apos;re missing the show , aren &apos;t we ?
after all , I ... I don &apos;t really have to change .
let &apos;s watch it together . I &apos;ll be beside you .
- Shall we go ?
- You know they &apos;re waiting out there to kill me .
you corrupt and destroy men ... as my brother was destroyed .
but when the evil is cut out of a beautiful thing ... then only the beauty remains .
we &apos;ve ... talked of this before , haven &apos;t we ?
those others whom you ... were they beautiful ?
I watched you tonight ... out there .
you were even more lovely than when I first saw you .
when you thought I was the woman &apos; subtle of heart &quot; ?
Solomon warned me against such a woman .
but that is the evil in you !
the evil which must be cut out ?
but ...
but isn &apos;t it the life in a thing which makes it beautiful ?
if you take the life away , then ...
then it becomes still .
then it is even more beautiful .
I &apos;ll be still for you .
I &apos;ll stand here quite still and let you look at me , if that &apos;s what you want .
I want to make sure that you belong only to me .
I love you ... and I hate the evil in you .
love is very close to hate .
did you know that ?
don &apos;t be afraid !
you have no reason to be afraid of me .
I have never known such beauty as yours ... nor such evil in such beauty .
men will not look at you again as they did tonight ! John !
John !
John !
Mr. Slade is here !
John !
John !
John !
John !
John !
the police are looking for the Ripper !
come , Kitty . we &apos;ll soon get you home .
they say the Ripper &apos;s loose in the audience . the crowd &apos;s half-mad . hurry .
let &apos;s try this way .
- You mustn &apos;t go out into the street .
- What shall we do ?
better keep her here . be easier to keep an eye on her .
- He slipped us , sir .
- He could still be in the building .
Bates , get some men , search those galleries . John , take charge of the stage .
right .
finish him off , sir .
take him alive .
- I know how to tackle him . - Watch out for his knife .
he &apos;ll cut you to pieces .
he must have been carried down this way .
he said deep water was restful ... and full of peace .
the river drew him even in the end .
a river sweeps a city clean .
carries things out to sea ... and they sink in deep water .
if it was him ...
I &apos;m glad .
aah !
man : &quot; dimitrios makropoulos . &quot;
the case of dimitrios makropoulos is now officially closed .
that is all , gentlemen .
Colonel haki , could you tell me- i &apos;m sorry .
gentlemen , there is nothing i can add to what you &apos;ve heard here .
I &apos;ve known of this dimitrios makropoulos for years , and yet have known so little about him , so very little .
we &apos;ll probably never know who killed him .
but whoever it was did us all a favor .
good night .
good evening , colonel haki .
good evening .
Ooh , colonel haki , how nice to see you .
Madame chavez .
this is such a wonderful party , so many beautiful women .
but none more beautiful than yourself .
you flatterer . I &apos;ve got a surprise for you .
the dutch writer cornelius leyden .
Cornelius latimer leyden here ?
wonderful .
you invited him for me ?
you expressed such a desire to meet him .
I must say i expected a different sort .
writers are writers .
leyden tells me he was professor of economics at the university of amsterdam before he became a writer .
he looks like it . ha ha .
Ah , there you are , mr . leyden .
I want you to meet my good friend colonel haki , who &apos;s an ardent reader of your books .
how do you do ?
Mr. Leyden , i long wanted to talk to the writer whose work i so much admire .
thank you very much .
well , i &apos;ll leave you gentlemen to discuss literature .
it would bore you , perhaps , but long have i admired mr .
leyden , and you understand , madame .
but of course . you &apos;ll excuse me , please ?
Madame .
I read nothing but detective stories .
I get them sent from paris .
all the best are translated into french .
to you , mr . leyden .
thank you .
I &apos;ve just added your une pelle ensanglantee to my library .
Formidable .
but i cannot quite understand the significance of the title .
well , &quot; bloody shovel . &quot;
exactly .
it is my ambition to write a good detective story of my own .
I have often thought i could do so , if i had only the time .
Oh , madame , such a pleasure .
Colonel haki .
I &apos;ve got to play the fool like this .
it is expected of me .
but don &apos;t think i like it . a cigarette ?
Yes , please .
please follow me .
I should like very much to talk to you , but these women ... come , let us go to the veranda where we will not be disturbed .
this is better .
Mm-hmm .
thank you .
you must excuse me if i am a little nervous .
all day i &apos;ve been involved in the affairs of a murderer .
are you interested in real murderers , mr . leyden ?
maybe . why ?
I find a murderer in a detective story much more sympathetic than a real murderer .
have you ever heard of dimitrios makropoulos ?
I don &apos;t think so .
I &apos;ve known of his existence for nearly 20 years .
a dirty , cowardly type .
murder , espionage , assassination .
Assas-well , that argues a certain courage , doesn &apos;t it ?
my dear leyden , dimitrios would have nothing to do with the actual shooting .
their kind never risk their skins for that .
they stay on the fringe of the blood .
but to me the most important thing to know about an assassination is not who fired the shot , but who paid for the bullet .
that &apos;s true .
as far as i know , no government ever caught dimitrios , and there is no photograph in his dossier .
but we knew him , all right- and so did athens , sofia , belgrade , paris .
he was a great traveler , this dimitrios .
was ?
sounds as if he were dead .
Yes , he &apos;s dead .
his bloated body was washed ashore this morning .
it is believed he had been knifed and thrown in the bosporus .
but then he died by violence .
that &apos;s very much like justice , isn &apos;t it ?
there &apos;s the writer speaking .
everything must be tight , artistic , like a detective story .
the case of dimitrios has loose ends- dozens of them .
in just one hour his body will be disposed of , and the loose ends will still be loose ends .
you see ?
it is not artistic .
now tell me , mr .
leyden , is there anything in this story that could be of the slightest interest to a writer ?
l-I &apos;ve always liked police work .
Colonel haki , i have a rather strange request to make .
anything .
I would very much like to see the body of that dimitrios , if it &apos;s possible .
by all means , but- you know , i &apos;ve never seen a dead man .
not even in a mortuary ... ugly devil , isn &apos;t he ?
these eyes have seen things i should like to see .
it is a pity that the mouth can never speak about them .
for 20 years it was my hope to get him .
now- not very prepossessing , is he , mr .
L-it isn &apos;t quite what a thought it would be .
would you like to see the wound ?
no , uh ... see ?
it &apos;s getting warm in here .
well , do you still want to hear more of dimitrios ?
if you have the time .
the evening is young .
shall we go to my hotel ?
it &apos;s a little better there .
splendid .
well , all we know of dimitrios is that he was born in 1889 .
he was found abandoned , parents unknown .
a poor family adopted him .
a good deed they had cause to regret .
1889 ... you have an exceptional memory .
that is my business .
the first time we heard of him was in smyrna , in 1922 .
the city was under martial law , and i was the head of the military police .
at that time , dimitrios worked as a fig-packer who already had a criminal record ... abdul .
dimitrios . are you in trouble ?
I must flee the country .
but i have no money , and the shipmasters are asking 1,000 piasters for passage .
well , i &apos;m a poor man , you know .
but if you could wait till saturday- oh , i can &apos;t .
but , abdul , i know where i can get the money .
1,000 piasters- 2,000 , and 2,000 for you .
what would i have to do ?
very little .
it &apos;s dimitrios , konrad . open up .
I got the plate , konrad .
I told you to come alone .
abdul &apos;s my partner . he shares with me .
let me see the plate .
if it isn &apos;t gold , i &apos;m not interested .
it &apos;s gold . I &apos;ll show you in back .
come on . let me see it now .
they shoot looters .
I risked my life for this plate .
come on .
now let me have the plate .
first we &apos;ll see what &apos;s in your safe .
robber !
now i &apos;ll show you the plate .
you said we wouldn &apos;t kill him .
he &apos;d tell the police . he &apos;s better dead .
I was willing to rob him , but murder ... they &apos;d hang us for robbery alone , you fool .
there &apos;s martial law here now .
but you killed him before you opened his safe .
his safe &apos;s full of worthless junk .
Oh , he was a clever one , that konrad .
but not clever enough for dimitrios .
here it is !
that &apos;s where i saw him hide it .
his money ?
naturally .
Ali !
wine !
fill them up again for everybody !
Ali , bring the wine !
Ali , where- we was only having a little drink .
would you have a drink with us ?
I do not drink .
you seem to have a lot of money .
perhaps you could tell me where you got it .
why , i ... dimitrios ?
wait , dimitrios !
I was only having a little drink ... i did not kill konrad , i tell you i did not kill him .
he stabbed himself ?
he robbed his own money ?
1,200 piasters were found in your possession .
a fig-packer , you affirm only to the winds .
I will give you one more chance .
did you or did you not rob konrad ?
rob him ?
Yes , yes , i robbed him .
but i did not kill him .
it was dimitrios , dimitrios who did it .
and who is dimitrios ?
he is a fig-packer , and a bad one .
he is always in trouble .
and he has fled the country , no doubt ?
Yes , that &apos;s why he wanted the money .
I am a man who loves other men as brothers .
I would not speak- enough !
hold your tongue , imbecile .
you &apos;ve admitted that you robbed konrad . that is sufficient .
even if there was 6 dimitrioses , you would still be guilty .
the sentence is death . take him out .
no !
no , no !
Oh , no , no , no !
I did not kill konrad !
I tell you , i did not kill him !
it was dimitrios !
dimitrios !
dimitrios !
that beggar was right .
but we had no definite proof till later .
what a despicable character , but as much as i hate to admit it , very brilliant .
Oh , yes . I don &apos;t deny it .
I see it intrigues your fancy .
you want to know more ?
certainly i want to know more .
I learned he had fled to athens .
I issued a warrant for his arrest , but he escaped me .
later i found out that he sometimes used the name of talat .
talat ?
T-a-l-a-t ?
but again too late , huh ?
Yes .
from athens we traced him to sofia , where in &apos; 23 a man named dimitrios was connected with the stambulisky affair .
no ?
then he turned up in belgrade .
that was ...
let me see- oh , yes , in 1926 .
this time stealing military secrets .
military secrets ?
nothing was too big for him , huh ?
no .
and the last time i heard of him was in paris in connection with an international smuggling gang .
when was that ?
between &apos; 29 and &apos; 31 , about that time .
the gang was eventually broken up .
dimitrios had betrayed them .
that &apos;s logical .
murder , treason , and betrayal .
that &apos;s the finishing touch .
what an evil genius that man was , but fascinating .
wonderful character for a novel .
you really think so ?
there &apos;s so much i don &apos;t know .
for instance , what is it about a man like that ?
why does anybody trust him in the first place ?
details . if i could only know more details .
you will need patience , mr . leyden .
Yes .
you see , colonel haki , i &apos;d love real characters for my stories .
and that man , well ... he obsesses me , and i admit it , and i have to go on .
I don &apos;t know whether i should like you for introducing me to that mr .
dimitrios or whether i should hate you for it .
it &apos;s true . I come to istanbul for a little rest .
well , tracing the life of dimitrios , i don &apos;t think that will be a very peaceful occupation , do you ?
no . ha ha !
where did you say he went from smyrna ?
Oh , athens .
I want a ticket for athens , please .
tomorrow morning .
one ticket .
leyden on phone :
what is the earliest train ?
7 : 00 .
thank you very much .
Yes , sir .
I beg your pardon .
is there a man named konstantin gollos staying in this hotel ?
no one by that name is registered , sir .
could you tell me if a mr .
gollos has been registered here any time during , say , the last 30 days or has he made any reservation ?
just a moment , please .
I &apos;m sorry , sir . I don &apos;t find any record of that name .
thank you , sir .
I beg your pardon , but would it be possible for me to view the remains of a man you have here ?
he may be a relative .
the place is empty . clean .
the paper said a man named dimitrios makropoulos- oh , him .
he &apos;s been disposed of an hour ago .
disposed of ... come .
organization is the secret of modern statecraft , but patience is necessary .
you say the surname was makropoulos ?
that &apos;s right- makropoulos .
dimitrios makropoulos .
that would be drawer number 13 .
why ?
because &quot; m &quot; is the 13th letter of the alphabet .
Oh .
this is organization .
that &apos;s very good .
makropoulos , makropoulos , makropoulos ... makropoulos , but no dimitrios .
gone .
who is gone ?
didn &apos;t you see that stout gentleman ?
I have no assistants in my work of organization here .
the whole burden falls on my shoulders , and people have no patience .
I &apos;m engaged for a moment , they cannot wait .
a man can only do his duty , no more , no less .
but patience ... pardon me , sir , could we try under the name of talat ?
talat ?
that is a turkish name .
I know , but could we try ?
talat . &quot; t &quot; that is the 20th letter of the alphabet .
that will be drawer number- 20 .
very clever .
talat !
dimitrios talat .
Yes ?
a fig-packer ?
that &apos;s right .
Mm-hmm ... name-dimitrios talat ;
born-salonika , 1889 ;
occupation-fig-packer ;
identity card lost ... said to have been issued at smyrna ;
warrant for arrest on charge of robbery and attempted murder .
that &apos;s dimitrios , all right .
you see ?
that is organization .
here you are , my man .
porter :
thank you .
HD i must apologize for intruding on your privacy .
Oh , please . you &apos;re not intruding .
this berth was not occupied .
how good of you to say so .
how little kindness there is in the world today , how little thought for others .
may i ask how far you are going ?
I &apos;m going to sofia .
Oh , beautiful city . beautiful .
I am continuing to bucharest .
Oh ?
I trust that we shall have a pleasant journey together .
I hope so .
will you allow me to smoke , please ?
please , go right ahead .
you know , the moment the attendant told me that there was a hollander on the train , i knew that i should have a pleasant journey .
that &apos;s very kind of you to say so .
I &apos;m english by birth .
but actually i &apos;m a citizen of the world .
to me , all languages are beautiful .
if only men would live as brothers without hatred , seeing only the beautiful things .
but no , there are always people who look on the black side .
well ... i think i &apos;m going to sleep now .
Sleep- a great mercy vouchsafed to us poor humans .
my name is mr . peters .
how do you do ?
if you &apos;ll forgive me , i think we &apos;re getting to sofia very early .
good night , sir .
we are coming into sofia , sir .
thank you , i &apos;m all ready .
good morning , sir .
good morning .
I &apos;m sorry , i tried not to awaken you .
I was not really asleep .
I want to tell you that the best hotel to stay in sofia is the slelyanska posada .
Oh , really ?
thank you , that &apos;s very kind of you .
that &apos;s the trouble with this world .
there &apos;s not enough kindness .
Good-bye , mr . leyden .
happy journey , sir .
how did he know my name ?
I didn &apos;t tell him .
I &apos;m very happy to repay you for the kindness you showed me in amsterdam , professor .
you are very clever people , you journalists .
I just talked to you this morning , and already you have discovered the only person here who knew dimitrios .
how did you do this ?
it was very easy the moment you mentioned the fact that dimitrios was one of the foreign agents in the stambulisky affair .
this is her establishment . she &apos;s the proprietress .
she does not get up until about 10 : 00 in the evening , so we &apos;ll probably have to wait awhile before we can talk to her .
Oh , that &apos;s all right .
you wished to see me , messieurs ?
we should be honored if you would sit at our table for a moment .
of course .
leyden :
thank you , madame .
champagne .
waiter :
Yes , madame .
I &apos;ve not seen you before , monsieur .
I &apos;ve seen you , but not here .
you going to write about me for the paris newspapers ?
so you &apos;ll stay and see the rest of my entertainment ?
we are trespassing on your hospitality to ask for some information .
information ?
I know nothing of interest to anyone .
your discretion is famous , madame .
this , however , concerns a man , now dead and buried , whom you knew over 15 years ago .
you pay me the most delicate compliments , monsieur .
15 years ?
you can &apos;t expect me to remember a man that long .
me hardly dared to hope that you &apos;d remember , but if a name means anything to you , it was dimitrios .
dimitrios makropoulos .
get out .
both of you . I don &apos;t like you in here .
but , madame- get out !
sit down .
you think i want a scene in here ?
if you will explain how we can leave without standing up , i shall be grateful .
are you a policeman ?
Oh , no , he &apos;s not with the police .
he &apos;s a writer of books . he seeks information .
why ?
he saw the dead body of dimitrios in istanbul and he &apos;s curious about him .
he &apos;s dead .
you &apos;re sure he &apos;s dead ?
you actually saw his body ?
it was found in the bosporus .
he &apos;d been stabbed .
did he have any money on him ?
now i shall never get it back .
wait ... come with me .
Madame ?
bring it to my room .
dimitrios ... july the 15 , 1923 .
that &apos;s when the money became due to me .
he promised faithfully he &apos;d pay me .
you &apos;re sure there was no money ?
no .
even his clothes were cheap and shabby .
I would &apos;ve sworn he &apos;d become rich .
dimitrios was not a man one forgets easily .
I &apos;ve known many men but i &apos;ve been afraid of only one dimitrios .
Voiceover :
I will remember the first time i ever saw him .
I &apos;d just returned from a drive with a friend .
until tomorrow then .
where to now , monsieur bostoff ?
home .
- Hello .
- Hello .
you have kept me waiting long enough .
I want my money . I want it right away .
I haven &apos;t got it . I &apos;ll have it for you in a day or two .
and i who have been a hotel keeper for 17 years should believe a story about a check ?
it &apos;s coming . I don &apos;t know what &apos;s held it up .
tonight i &apos;ll send a telegram .
with what ?
I thought you &apos;d lend me 10 leva .
I would as soon throw the money into the street !
there are things about this hotel the police would like to know .
the fire hazards , the broken stairs- you think you can intimidate me ?
my place is open to the police at all times .
they are my friends !
you cheap crook .
it is i who will call the police .
I &apos;ll have you arrested for fraud .
120 leva by tomorrow morning , or the police will come .
understand ?
Irana :
who is it ?
what do you want ?
you &apos;ve got the wrong place .
I live in the room next door .
I &apos;ve seen you around , but- how dare you !
you got any food ?
what ?
something to eat .
you really are hungry ?
would i ask a woman for food if i weren &apos;t starving ?
Irana , voice-over :
he was hungry and homeless .
I fed him and gave him money .
he paid me back in his own peculiar way .
Yes ?
it &apos;s me- dimitrios .
Oh , go away .
open up , it &apos;s important .
no , i &apos;ve done all i &apos;m going to do for you .
Yeah . but i want to pay you back .
I &apos;ve got 2,500 leva to give you .
2,500 leva ?
are you crazy ?
look under the door .
got 1,500 more to give you if you let me in .
1,000 you have , another 1,000 , and 500 , and 2,500 for me .
you were starving , and now- now i &apos;m paying you back for that crust of bread you gave me- a very good payment .
where did you get this money ?
there &apos;s plenty more where this came from .
I called on monsieur bostoff this morning .
you didn &apos;t .
I asked him for the money , and he gave it to me .
I only had to mention your name .
you blackmailed him . how could you ?
he loved me .
he was a funny , fat little man , but he loved me .
I &apos;m not fat or funny , but i love you .
you love me .
you blackmailed bostoff to show your love .
it costs money to love .
if he loved you , why didn &apos;t he take you out of this hole ?
a girl as beautiful as you should have the best .
jewels , furs , a fine apartment .
I &apos;ll get them for you .
by blackmail ?
what are you thinking about ?
wine .
what about the wine ?
I like it .
I must be crazy .
why ?
to love you .
what &apos;s wrong with that ?
everybody stay where you are .
have your papers ready .
your passport .
dimitrios makropoulos .
your name is familiar .
you &apos;re a member of the c.m.u .
there &apos;s no law against that .
no , not yet .
but we do not like foreigners who belong to so-called &quot; bulgarian patriotic societies . &quot;
come along .
you &apos;re wasting your time .
I &apos;ve a great deal of time . come along .
Irana , voice-over :
dimitrios stayed in jail only long enough to get in touch with a man he knew , someone to whom he would not introduce me .
man :
you understand that i have watched for you .
Yes , i understand .
the moment i withdraw my guarantee , you will be deported to greece .
all right , all right .
I said i &apos;d do the job , monsieur vaxoff .
but it &apos;s difficult work , and the price is- the price is quite high enough .
Irana , voice-over :
I knew that this important friend of dimitrios had secured his release for a purpose .
but what that purpose was i did not know until a few days later , when all bulgaria heard of it .
dimitrios !
what &apos;s the matter ?
the police will be here at any moment .
you must tell them i &apos;ve been here all day .
what have you done ?
there &apos;s no time for that now .
who is it ?
Yes ?
how long has he been here ?
all afternoon , but i don &apos;t see that that &apos;s any business of yours .
you &apos;d swear to that in court ?
naturally .
what do they mean ?
I &apos;m a greek subject , but my passport is in order .
I don &apos;t understand .
I &apos;m not without friends in sofia .
perhaps you know monsieur vaxoff ?
Mr. Vaxoff ?
of the eurasian credit trust ?
I see .
dimitrios , what happened ?
it &apos;ll be in all the papers .
an attempt was made to assassinate the premier- stambulisky .
not you .
of course not .
however , i &apos;ll have to leave town for a while .
how much money have you got ?
money ?
but i thought you- i &apos;ll need 1,000 french francs .
I know you &apos;ve got it . I &apos;ve given you plenty .
why don &apos;t you get it from your important monsieur vaxoff ?
because they &apos;ll be watching him for a while .
I &apos;ll send you the money back in a week ... with interest .
that &apos;s the last time i saw dimitrios .
if you will excuse me , messieurs , it &apos;s time i returned to my guests .
you see , i know nothing about dimitrios of any interest .
it was of great interest , madame .
I &apos;m very thankful .
won &apos;t you allow me to pay you for the drinks , madame ?
if you like .
no .
I have a superstition about money being shown in my private room .
you can pay the waiter at your table .
thank you . good night , madame .
utterly without scruple .
completely unmoral .
but fascinating .
that &apos;s funny ... would you be so good as to shut the door behind you ?
I think if you stretched out your left hand , you could do it without moving your feet .
what is the meaning of all this ?
this is most awkward .
I didn &apos;t expect you back so soon .
I can see that .
I had hoped to get things tidied up . such vandalism .
a book is a lovely thing .
a garden stocked with beautiful flowers .
a magic carpet on which to fly away to unknown climes .
what are you talking about ?
a little frankness , mr . leyden , please .
there could only be one reason why your room should be searched , and you know that as well as i do .
of course i can understand your difficulty .
you &apos;re wondering exactly where i stand .
if it &apos;s any consolation to you , however , i may say my difficulty is wondering exactly where you stand .
I &apos;m tired . I &apos;ll go to bed .
say , what on earth are you doing here ?
last night i met you on a train .
you said you were going to bucharest .
now i find you here waving this silly pistol in my face .
I can only conclude you &apos;re a thief or you &apos;re drunk .
are you drunk , sir ?
maybe you &apos;re mad .
well , in that case , i can only humor you and hope for the best .
perfect .
no , no .
keep away from that telephone , please .
since you have returned so unexpectedly , since i can no longer meet you on a basis of , may i say , disinterested friendship , let us be frank with one another .
why are you so interested in dimitrios ?
dimitrios ?
Yes , dear mr . leyden , dimitrios .
you &apos;ve come from the levant .
dimitrios came from there .
in athens , you were very energetically seeking his record in the relief commission archives .
Well- wait before you answer .
I have no animosity towards you .
I bear you no ill will , let that be clear .
but as it happens , i , too , am interested in dimitrios .
and because of that i am interested in you .
now , mr . leyden , tell me frankly where you stand .
What-forgive the expression , please- is your game ?
my game , huh ?
well , i &apos;ll tell you what my game is if you tell me yours .
I have nothing to hide .
would you mind telling me what you hope to find in the bindings of my books or in the tube of my toothpaste ?
would you mind telling me that ?
I was looking for an answer to my question .
but all i found was this .
you see , i felt that if you hid papers between the leaves of books , you might also hide more interesting papers in the bindings .
it was never intended to be hidden .
and is this all you know about dimitrios , mr .
no .
now , who , i wonder , is this colonel haki who seems so well-informed and so indiscreet ?
the name is turkish .
and poor dimitrios was taken from us in istanbul , was he not ?
and you have come from istanbul , haven &apos;t you ?
Mm-hmm .
you know , it almost looks as if you &apos;d been reading a turkish police dossier , now , doesn &apos;t it , eh ?
for every question you ask , you &apos;ll have to answer one .
had you ever met him ?
I mean , actually met him ?
I don &apos;t think you &apos;re very sure of yourself , mr . leyden .
I have an idea that i can tell you much more than you can tell me .
I think i must be going .
good night .
I thought you were going . good night .
istanbul , istanbul , smyrna , 1922 , sofia .
now , i wonder ... i wonder if it would be very stupid of me to imagine that you were thinking of going to belgrade in the near future , would it , mr .
leyden ?
you &apos;ll like belgrade . such a beautiful city .
the views from the turrets- you can &apos;t imagine .
magnificent .
see here .
Mr. Peters , a moment ago you mentioned a bureau of records in athens .
weren &apos;t you there while i was there ?
the stout gentleman !
then it was no accident that you were on the same train , in the same compartment , no accident that you recommended the hotel .
I &apos;ve known everything you &apos;ve done since you left the record bureau in athens .
I &apos;ve already told you i &apos;m interested in anyone that &apos;s interested in dimitrios .
but what on earth is your great interest in dimitrios ?
money ? he had none .
I saw his body at the mortuary , but you &apos;re certain- what &apos;s the matter ?
did i understand you to say that you actually saw the body of dimitrios in the mortuary ?
I said i did . what do you want ?
take your hands off me !
say , you are insane .
Mr. Leyden , we must reach an understanding .
we must stop this quarreling .
it &apos;s absolutely essential that i know what you &apos;re after .
and i want to know- no , no , no .
please don &apos;t interrupt me .
I admit i probably need your answers more than you need mine , but i cannot give you mine at present .
then you won &apos;t get mine .
Yes , yes , i heard what you said , but i &apos;m talking seriously .
listen , please .
if you go to belgrade , you will not discover a single trace of dimitrios .
furthermore , you may find yourself in trouble with the authorities if you pursue the matter .
there &apos;s only one man who could and would , under certain circumstances , tell you what you want to know .
he lives near geneva .
now , then , i will give you his name , and i will give you a letter to him , but first i must know why you want this information .
your passport describes you as a writer , but that is a very elastic term .
who are you , mr . leyden ?
and what is your game ?
I have no game .
naturally when i ask what your game is , i use the phrase in a specific sense .
your game is of course to get money .
but that is not the answer i mean .
are you rich , mr . leyden ?
ha .
no . then what i have to say may be simplified .
I am proposing an alliance , mr . leyden .
a pooling of resources .
I am aware of certain facts which i cannot at the moment tell you about .
you , on the other hand , possess an important piece of information .
you may not know that it is important , but nevertheless it is .
now , my facts alone are not worth a great deal .
your piece of information is quite valueless without my facts .
the two together , however , are worth at the very least- at the very least- a million french francs .
one million ?
what do you say to that ?
you &apos;ll forgive me , mr .
peters , but i don &apos;t understand what you &apos;re talking about , not that it makes any difference what i do or not , but ... oh , i think i &apos;m tired .
I &apos;m very tired , and i want to go to bed .
one million , huh ?
no , mr . peters .
well , i suppose there &apos;s no reason why i shouldn &apos;t tell you what my interest in dimitrios is , but it certainly isn &apos;t money .
I make a decent living .
as you know , detective stories sell very well .
detective stories ... mr .
leyden , may i use your paper ?
Oh , go right ahead . you used everything else .
detective stories .
now , that &apos;s most interesting to me , mr . leyden .
I &apos;m so fond of them .
I &apos;m glad you like them .
well , the first time i heard about dimitrios was in istanbul , from colonel haki .
I don &apos;t know exactly how it happened , but somehow i found myself trying to trace his strange career .
why ?
partly for my amusement , i suppose .
I had nothing better to do .
maybe that was why i was interested in such a colorful character .
I don &apos;t expect you to believe me , but it &apos;s the truth .
if you don &apos;t like it , too bad .
here , mr . leyden , are 3 pieces of paper .
on the first is written the name of the man of whom i spoke to you .
the name is grodek . he lives just outside geneva .
the second is a letter to him .
if you will present that letter , he will know that you are a friend of mine and that he can be frank with you .
and incidentally , it was he who employed dimitrios in 1926 .
Oh , really ?
uh , what about this one ?
I think you said you were not rich ?
no , i &apos;m not rich .
half a million francs ... would be useful to you ?
well , it wouldn &apos;t make me sad .
well , then , mr .
leyden , when you have tired of geneva , i want you to , how do you say , to kill two birds with one stone .
Ahem .
here on this list of yours are other dates besides 1926 still to be accounted for .
if you are to know what there is to know about dimitrios , the place to account for them is paris .
that is the first thing .
the second is if you will come to paris , if you will consider then the pooling of resources , the alliance that i have already proposed to you , i can definitely guarantee that in a very few days you will have at least a half a million french francs .
at the moment i cannot say more .
but if you will believe in and trust me , if you will come to paris , then here on this piece of paper is an address .
when you arrive send a pneumatique to me .
do not call , for it is the address of a friend .
I have put you to so much trouble .
Oh , no trouble at all .
I wish to make restitution in a practical way .
half a million francs is worth considering , eh ?
and i would guarantee it .
but , uh , we must trust one another , that is most important .
Au revoir , mr . leyden .
I won &apos;t say good-bye .
half a million francs , mr .
leyden , will buy a lot of good things .
I do hope we shall meet in paris .
good night .
Ohh ... mr .
excuse me , monsieur .
I did not hear the car arrive .
I was playing my favorite bach .
Oh , i see that you have introduced yourself to eloise and abelard .
do you like cats ?
very much .
I love them , monsieur .
this is eloise . isn &apos;t she beautiful ?
Oh , beautiful .
and so inscrutable , like a woman .
Ravissante .
go back to your lover now .
won &apos;t you sit down , please ?
Yes , thank you .
very kind of you to receive me , sir .
well , i don &apos;t know exactly what mr . peters said in his letter .
Mr. Peters was very frank about you .
Oh , was he ?
he said that you were writing a book .
I , too , am writing a book .
Oh , really ?
your memoirs ?
Oh , no , monsieur .
I am writing the life of saint francis .
pardon me ?
Yes , indeed .
but i confidently expect to be dead before it is finished .
do you care for english whiskey ?
Yes , i do , very much .
good . I , too , prefer it as an aperitif .
Oh , yes . may i have a cigarette , please ?
please , help yourself .
thank you .
have you known mr . peters long ?
no , i ... i met him once in a train and then again in my hotel in sofia .
thank you .
monsieur , i wonder what your attitude would be if i were to ask an impertinent question .
please , go right ahead .
if i were , for instance , to ask you to tell me seriously , if a literary interest in human frailty were your only reason for approaching me ?
monsieur , i can assure you- i &apos;m quite certain that you can , but forgive me , monsieur .
what are your assurances worth ?
all i can do is give you my word that any information you give me i &apos;ll treat as confidential .
I don &apos;t think i have made myself quite clear .
the information itself is nothing .
what happened in belgrade in 1926 if of little importance now .
it &apos;s my own position of which i am thinking .
you see my point ?
I &apos;m a little suspicious , monsieur .
I still have enemies in this world .
supposing , therefore , if you tell me just what your relations with our friend peters are .
would you like to do that ?
I would , but i can &apos;t ... for the simple reason that i don &apos;t know what our relations are myself .
I was not joking , mr . leyden .
nor i .
as you know , sir , i was investigating the life of dimitrios , and while doing so i met this mr .
peters .
well , for some reason , i don &apos;t know why , he seemed to be interested in dimitrios , too .
he followed me to sofia , and there he approached me- behind a pistol .
he made me an offer .
Ah .
if i would meet him in paris and collaborate in some sort of a scheme he had in mind , we should each profit to the extent of half a million francs .
I see .
he said that i had some piece of information in my possession which , when used in conjunction with some information that he possessed , should prove of great value .
and what may i ask is this so valuable piece of information in your possession ?
that &apos;s what i don &apos;t know .
come now , monsieur .
you ask for my confidences .
the least you can do is to give me yours .
but it &apos;s true . I don &apos;t know .
well ... well , yes , at one point in our conversation , he became very excited .
at what point ?
when i explained to him how i knew that dimitrios had no money when he died .
and how did you know ?
well , it &apos;s very simple .
because i saw the body .
you saw the body ?
Yes , everything taken from it was right there on the mortuary table , but there was no money , none .
not a single penny .
another drink , monsieur ?
Oh , yes , please .
you see ? I don &apos;t know what my relations to mr .
peters are myself .
Mm-hmm .
straight ?
Yes , please .
a toast , monsieur leyden ... to the detective story .
thank you , sir .
to your book .
forgive me , monsieur .
a thought crossed my mind that made me laugh .
it was a thought of our friend peters confronting you with a pistol .
you know , he &apos;s quite terrified of firearms .
with me , he kept his fears to himself very successfully .
a clever man , peters .
may i be permitted as a friend to give you a word of advice , mr .
- Please do .
- Then , if i were in your place i should be inclined to take our friend peters at his word .
- And go to paris .
- Really ?
I think i shall tell you about dimitrios .
my friend peters has probably reffered to me as a master spy .
the term is ambiguous .
actually it means that i was an employer of spy labor that &apos;s how i came to employ dimitrios .
he was well recommended for this particular job .
which i don &apos;t mind telling you was on behalf of italy .
relations between italy and yugoslavia in 1926 were a bit strained .
my assignment was to get a copy of the yugoslav minefield chart .
and for that job i employed dimitrios .
I was in belgrade myself , and had ample opportunity to watch him in action .
I left the whole matter entirely up to dimitrios , but i was interested to see how he started .
at the time , he was using the name of wagner- even herr wagner .
can you direct me to the department of supply ?
Yes , sir . second floor , to your left .
thank you .
woman :
Yes ?
Oh , i beg your pardon . I seem to be lost .
could you direct me to the department of supply ?
it &apos;s down the hall to your right .
thank you .
thank you very much .
man :
you may part again , bulic .
I hope you &apos;ll be luckier this time .
if i have the cards , i am lucky , if i don &apos;t have the cards , i &apos;m unlucky .
go away .
why ?
last night , every time you whistled a love song , he led a heart .
go away , please .
but i only-
Oh , excuse me- i &apos;m a stranger in belgrade , but i played bezique in germany , and i &apos;m wondering if you play it the same way in this country .
bezique is bezique .
I like it better than the german pinochle .
Oh , i , too .
my patriotism doesn &apos;t go as far as the cards .
may i buy you a drink ... all of you gentlemen ?
man :
a free drink ? why not ?
of course .
come join us .
thank you .
waiter , a drink for all of us .
Yes , sir .
my firm , the dresden optical company , has a bid in for the sale of 10,000 pairs of binoculars .
binoculars .
the order would mean a great deal .
I understand that , but surely you don &apos;t expect me- for 20,000 dinar ?
that &apos;s a lot of money .
but i &apos;m afraid you overestimate my importance in the government .
in any event , i have no influence with the department of supply , who pass this on to people .
but you probably know the right official .
you fellows stick together .
true , true ... 20,000 dinar ... yes ?
do you think i could see mr . Druhar for a moment ?
you work down the hall , don &apos;t you ?
I &apos;m afraid i don &apos;t know your name .
bulic . karel bulic .
Oh , i suppose it &apos;s all right . go on in .
well , what is it ?
Mr. Druhar , i was wondering if , uh ... i mean ... about these optical bids .
what about them ?
what about them .
I just-i have a friend of mine ... i just wondered if you would tell me when the announcement of the awards would be made .
I don &apos;t know why you should be interested , but if it does you any good to know , the list will be posted this afternoon .
Oh , thank you very much , i ... hey , bulic , you are late .
a packet of pachas .
bulic . bulic my friend .
Oh , herr wagner , i am so sorry .
I have very bad news .
I have very good news for you .
my firm was awarded the contract for the binoculars .
I owe it all to you .
the award was made to nanovic company of czechoslovakia .
our czech subsidiary .
subsidiary ?
Yes . we put in two bids :
one for our parent company in germany and the other for our subsidiary much lower .
much lower .
here &apos;s the money i promised you :
20,000 dinar .
20,000 dinar .
my wife ... now i can buy her all those things i wanted .
of course you can .
we must have a celebration .
you and your wife will be my guests this evening .
Oh , herr bulic .
who is it ?
karel .
Oh , it &apos;s you . well , come in .
I can &apos;t open the door .
Hello , anna , darling .
look what i brought for you .
the most wonderful thing has happened to me .
come here . look .
Ooh !
look .
but that &apos;s nothing .
look .
Oh , karel , it &apos;s beautiful .
that &apos;s nothing . look .
no , no . that &apos;s for me .
karel , they gave you a raise in salary .
no , something much more wonderful has happened to me .
where did you get that money ?
you didn &apos;t steal it ?
no . I did a slight service for a friend of mine .
I helped him to get a government contract , and he paid me 20,000 dinar .
20,000 dinar .
you see , i &apos;m not the little unimportant nobody whom you always thought i were .
from now on , there &apos;ll be no more of this because your husband will get the best for you ... because i love you .
I love you so much .
now , see how fast you can get ready .
we go out for dinner .
Oh , where ?
a very expensive place .
a friend of mine , herr wagner .
darling , it won &apos;t take me a minute .
to madame .
thank you .
I &apos;ve lived in belgrade all my life , but i &apos;ve never been to a place like this .
Madame , you should come here more often .
you &apos;re the most beautiful woman in the place .
Oh , you lucky fellow , every man in the place is looking at madame .
me , too .
that distinguished-looking gentleman over there is the freiherr von kissling .
terribly rich . controls as many as 27 companies .
excuse me , gentlemen .
of course .
Herr wagner , is it not ?
why , herr von kissling , this is indeed a pleasure .
Madame bulic , may i present the freiherr von kissling ?
how do you do ?
and my very good friend , herr bulic .
how do you do , herr bulic ?
Herr bulic is an important official in the yugoslav government , a pleasure , herr bulic .
I beg your pardon .
it is indeed a great pleasure , sir .
why , herr von kissling , why don &apos;t you join us ?
may i ?
of course .
thank you .
waiter , another bottle of champagne .
please sit down .
bulic :
thank you .
Herr bulic , you must forgive me for forcing myself upon your company .
from my own table , i could not resist admiring madame .
I presumed that on my acquaintance with herr wagner ... i consider it a compliment .
Madame , i wonder if you would be so kind as to dance with an old man .
Oh , i haven &apos;t danced in so long .
and i am old and clumsy .
the freiherr is taken with your wife , and i must say i can &apos;t blame him .
you should take her to these places more often .
isn &apos;t she beautiful ?
I can &apos;t afford it .
well , my dear bulic , you forget you &apos;ve just earned 20,000 dinar , and that &apos;s only the beginning .
regardless , the freiherr likes you .
I can tell by his expression .
he &apos;s famous for associating with in-men whom he likes .
he doubtless has a company or two right here in yugoslavia .
Madame is a divine dancer .
karel , i &apos;m having so much fun tonight .
freiherr :
Miss .
will you permit me ?
orchid .
the first i &apos;ve ever had .
it &apos;s so beautiful .
it &apos;s hardly beautiful enough for you .
that &apos;s rather a large amount of money to carry with you , freiherr .
wagner :
isn &apos;t it a little dangerous ?
perhaps . I don &apos;t usually carry so much with me .
as a matter of fact , i won this money in werner &apos;s room .
do you know about werner ?
he has the back room .
he &apos;s quite the most reliable gambler in belgrade .
in werner &apos;s , it &apos;s your own luck and not the croupier &apos;s skill that counts .
from the look of that , you &apos;ve been very lucky .
quite , in every way .
since you &apos;ve never been in werner &apos;s , i shall be delighted if you would accompany me there .
but we &apos;ve never gambled ... you may enjoy watching me win .
perhaps you will bring me more luck .
Herr bulic , i have been thinking .
I wonder if you could have luncheon with me one day this week .
Yes !
Ahem .
Oh , yes it is possible that we can discuss something to our mutual advantage .
Mutual-yes .
Yes .
now , shall we try our luck ?
Herr wagner , i &apos;ve never gambled for money .
Oh , my dear bulic , suppose you lose a few hundred dinar .
there &apos;s really no need to concern yourself over so paltry a sum .
the freiherr has already expressed an interest in you , and that means your fortune is made .
but , herr wagner ... please don &apos;t disappoint him by showing yourself less important than you seem to be now .
I see ... croupier :
rouge et pair .
we have won .
let &apos;s leave it there .
should we risk it all ?
of course .
Herr bulic , play red with us .
I rather play black .
we have won again .
Oh , but karel has lost .
Herr bulic is an individualist .
let &apos;s take a big chance .
let &apos;s leave it all red .
all right .
that &apos;s mine , 3 blues on red .
Oh , we shouldn &apos;t have played it all .
we cannot win every time .
Yes , but karel hasn &apos;t won yet .
5,000 please .
40,000 dinar .
I must have been mad .
it &apos;s nothing , herr bulic .
you &apos;ll win another time .
freiherr , will you take madame back to our table while herr bulic and i settle things with the management ?
we shall have a good dinner now ... and then some more champagne .
Yes ?
man on intercom :
bulic lost 40. owe 20,000 .
all right .
Herr wagner .
Herr werner .
I see you have given us back a little of the money you won the other night , both you and the freiherr von kissling .
don &apos;t worry , werner . we &apos;ll win it again and more another time .
very likely .
you are herr bulic .
very unfortunate that you should lose so heavily your first time here .
Herr bulic is a very dear friend of mine , werner .
at the moment he is unable to make good the notes he signed during the excitement of play .
Oh ? when , may i ask , can you pay ?
I don &apos;t know . never .
Oh , come now .
you don &apos;t look like the sort who &apos;d gamble in a casino and not pay his losses .
I am not .
I had 20,000 dinar . it &apos;s all gone .
I haven &apos;t any money . I don &apos;t know how to get it .
I would help herr bulic if i could , but unfortunately , i have exceeded my expense account .
perhaps the freiherr could help you out .
Oh , no , no .
well , it seems that i shall be compelled to take steps .
who &apos;s your employer ?
no , please .
that won &apos;t due , werner .
Herr bulic is an official of the government .
it would mean dismissal .
well , i &apos;m not interested- well , now wait .
perhaps i can help herr bulic after all .
can you give us 24 hours ?
24 hours .
very well . if you say so , herr wagner .
24 hours .
Herr bulic .
thank you very much .
Herr wagner ... my wife ... oh , we &apos;ll say nothing of this to madame .
we &apos;ll let her believe that everything &apos;s agreeable .
tomorrow we &apos;ll talk this all over . it won &apos;t be so difficult .
you will help me , won &apos;t you ?
trust me , my friend .
Yes ?
thank you .
bulic ?
Yes . he has taken our little hint .
why , herr bulic .
werner telephoned me at the office .
why would he do that ?
he said he wanted to check up on me .
I have no privacy at the ministry .
he must not telephone me there again .
of course . he shouldn &apos;t embarrass you .
a drink ?
no , thank you .
well , herr bulic , i think i can help you .
you can ?
Oh , if you could get me out of this frightful situation , i &apos;ll be in your debt forever .
I &apos;ll never gamble another dinar .
I spoke by telephone to my principles .
they &apos;re very grateful to you for your assistance with the binocular contract .
they gave me permission to make another arrangement with you .
any assistance i can give .
but it won &apos;t be time . werner said tonight .
well , let &apos;s see .
you owe werner 20,000 dinar .
what would you say to 50,000 dinar by this evening ?
by this evening ?
I can get the money for you from the eurasian credit trust , provided you fulfill your part of the bargain .
Herr wagner , i &apos;d do anything , anything .
in your office is a chart , a chart of the proposed minefields of the otranto straits .
you &apos;ll bring it to me this evening .
you dirty spy .
the only risk you take is in not doing as you &apos;re told .
you &apos;re quite sure he &apos;ll come ?
I &apos;m positive of it .
the only thing i &apos;m not positive of is the 50,000 francs you &apos;re to pay me for this job .
you &apos;ll see the money the moment i get the chart .
and here , my friend , are your 50,000 francs .
thank you , grodek .
now you &apos;ll lay your camera on the table and place your hands behind your head .
you , too , werner . turn around .
I know you &apos;re ambitious , but you certainly cannot expect to get away with this .
why not ?
the chart &apos;s worth 50,000 francs to you .
it &apos;s probably worth twice that amount to the italian government .
besides , werner &apos;s getting your money back from bulic .
dimitrios , you can &apos;t .
I can . I can do anything .
no , no , werner .
the scoundrel .
incredible .
and then did you let him get away with the chart ?
he sold it to another government .
but it didn &apos;t do them any good .
the yugoslavs learned that the chart had been stolen .
naturally , they made an entire new plat immediately , and dimitrios &apos; buyers paid out their money for nothing .
but so did you .
not exactly .
I gave italy her money &apos;s worth .
there was no difficulty obtaining the new yugoslav chart , without bulic &apos;s assistance , of course .
poor , confused little man .
he put a bullet through his head .
Oh , terrible .
my dear leyden , bulic was a traitor .
one cannot sentimentalize over traitors .
I know , he was an honest man fundamentally , but it was all too much for him .
in the end , his innate honesty got the best of him .
he gave the 50,000 dinar to his wife , then he went to the ministry and told them what he had done .
after that , there was nothing left except to kill himself .
it is at times like those , monsieur , that one needs one &apos;s sense of humor .
well , mr . leyden , don &apos;t you think you should go to paris ?
how could i resist ... now ?
Entree .
Mr. Leyden , i was so glad to get your letter .
Oh , you &apos;re knocking at doors now .
quite an improvement , sir . quite an improvement .
my dear mr . leyden , i cannot tell you how pleased i am to see you .
welcome to paris .
have you had a good journey ?
you &apos;re looking well .
grodek wrote , telling me how charming and sympathetic you were .
good fellow , isn &apos;t he ?
those cats of his he worships .
Yes . they are beautiful , and his whiskey &apos;s excellent .
Oh , he wanted to know what business i had with you .
as i don &apos;t know , i felt i safely could confide in him .
by the way , do you have your pistol with you ?
dear me , no , mr . leyden .
why should i bring such a thing on a friendly visit to you ?
well , you &apos;ve been known to do it .
look here , mr . peters .
I &apos;d hate to be impolite with a professional gentleman like yourself , but there is a limit even to my patience .
I &apos;ve traveled a long way to see you , and i want to know why .
so you shall .
I &apos;ve heard that before .
before you start beating about the bush again , there are one or two things that you should know .
I &apos;m not a violent man , mr . peters .
as a matter of fact , i hate violence , but there are times when the most peace-loving simply must do it ,
and this may be one of them .
I know who you are .
your name is not peters . it &apos;s peterson-eric peterson .
I also know that you were a member of a smuggling gang organized by dimitrios .
I know you were arrested in december 1931 and fined 2,000 francs .
you were sentenced to prison for one month , correct ?
I took the liberty of going to the library yesterday , and what do i find in our newspaper files ?
no .
this little picture .
Ah , yes . a newspaper . I could not believe my friend grodek- well , then you don &apos;t deny it ?
Oh no , it is the truth .
well , then mr . peterson ... peters , mr .
leyden . I decided to change the name .
all right , peters .
I agree with you , sir . peters is a much nicer name .
when i was in istanbul , i heard some very interesting things about the end of those smugglers .
somebody there said that dimitrios betrayed all of you .
sent a dossier to the police , i think , anonymously .
is that true ?
dimitrios behaved very badly to us all .
I was also told that there was talk of vengeance .
that all of you threatened to kill dimitrios , as soon as you were free .
- Is that true ?
- I did not threaten .
some of the others did so .
constantine gullus , for example was always a hothead .
Oh , i see .
you didn &apos;t threaten . you preferred to act .
I don &apos;t understand you , mr . leyden .
no ... let me put it to you this way .
I think you are very indiscreet ... am i ?
and very fortunate .
just suppose i had , as you suggest , killed dimitrios .
think what i should be forced to do .
I should be forced to kill you also , now , shouldn &apos;t i ?
there it is .
I knew it . I knew it .
you see , i lied to you a moment ago . I admit it .
I was so curious to know what you were going to do if you thought i was unarmed .
you understand my feelings a little ?
so anxious to have your confidence .
all of which is as clever a reply to an accusation of murder as one could wish for .
Mr. Leyden , this is not a detective story .
even if you cannot be discreet , at least use your imagination .
is it likely that dimitrios would make a will in my favor ? no .
then how do you suppose i could kill him for his money ?
people in these days do not keep their wealth in treasure chests .
come now , mr . leyden .
let us please be sensible .
let us have dinner together , and after , talk business .
you probably disapprove of me .
I really cannot blame you .
but let us at least cultivate an illusion of friendship .
I could think of a lot of reasons why i shouldn &apos;t have dinner with you .
just the same , i will , but let me warn you , unless i have this evening a satisfactory explanation for your asking me to come to paris , i shall , half a million francs or no half a million francs ,
leave by the first available train .
is that clear ?
couldn &apos;t be clearer , mr . leyden .
and may i say how much i appreciate your frankness .
all right . where shall we dine ?
there &apos;s a romanian place near here .
and afterwards , we &apos;ll go to my apartment for coffee .
thank you .
excellent dinner . now for coffee .
what about mr . godfrey ?
he &apos;s away . at the moment , i &apos;m in sole possession .
I see .
peters :
you conclude , i suppose , that i am godfrey ?
Mm-hmm .
thank you .
peters :
do you like it ?
well , it &apos;s rather unusual .
actually , just another uncomfortable french house .
Immanently an oasis in a desert of discomfort .
leyden : heh heh .
dimitrios furnished it .
dimitrios ?
Yes . he bought this house and the two adjoining .
there are secret doors leading from one house to another .
in case of police raids , you know ?
thank you .
leyden :
aren &apos;t you , uh , a little indiscreet living here ?
Oh , no . you see , dimitrios bought the houses originally in my name .
after my incarceration , i sold them quite legally to a monsieur godfrey .
Uh-huh .
do you like algerian coffee , mr . leyden ?
pardon me ? Yes .
it takes a little longer to prepare it , but i prefer it .
Oh , by the way , do you recognize him , mr . leyden ?
why yes , certainly , it &apos;s dimitrios .
what about it ?
you recognize him . good .
that , mr . leyden , is a photograph of constantine gullus .
gullus ?
gullus ... what on earth do you mean ?
what you saw on the mortuary slab in istanbul , mr .
leyden , was gullus after he tried to put certain ideas about dimitrios into practice .
I saw the body of dimitrios with my own eyes .
you saw the body of gullus , mr .
leyden , after dimitrios had killed him .
dimitrios himself , i am glad to say , is alive and in good health .
dimitrios alive .
no , no . it isn &apos;t possible .
I saw his name inside the coat :
dimitrios makropoulos .
it was a french identification card .
French identification card .
ha ha ha !
that i find amusing .
ha ha ha !
I could get you a dozen genuine identification cards , mr .
leyden , and each in the name of dimitrios makropoulos .
I guess you could .
he &apos;s alive ...
but where is he ?
here , in paris .
you &apos;ve been very reasonable , mr .
leyden , i shall tell you everything .
as you may imagine , we were all very angry with dimitrios .
some of us threatened revenge .
I became a wanderer , mr . leyden .
a little business here , a little business there , travel and meditation , that was my life .
I met gullus in rome .
he told me that he was on the track of dimitrios .
asked me to lend him 3,000 francs to conclude his search .
I gave it to him . with that money , gullus went to paris .
well , sir , he found dimitrios living in a big home under an assumed name , a rich man .
gullus intended to kill dimitrios , but his nerve failed him .
he settled for blackmail .
that was his mistake .
dimitrios took him on a cruise to istanbul .
there , he stabbed him , put a false identification card in his clothing , and tossed him into the bosporus .
a bloated corpse washed up by the sea .
I think you &apos;re guessing .
how could you know ?
you weren &apos;t there .
ha !
but you forget the 3,000 francs i loaned gullus .
he sent it to me in paris with a note saying he was going on an aegean cruise with dimitrios .
I decided to meet him in istanbul , but when i got there , it was too late .
the only thing left for me was to try and find out those things about dimitrios that gullus had known .
then , mr . leyden , our paths began to cross .
Mmm .
well , now that you &apos;ve found him , what next ?
come now , mr . leyden , surely you are not as obtuse as all this .
you alone can prove that the man buried in istanbul is not dimitrios . , * if necessary , you can identify gullus &apos; photographs on the police files .
I , on the other hand , know where to find dimitrios .
our joint silence will be worth a lot of money to him .
with gullus &apos; fate in mind , we should know , too , how to deal with the matter .
we should demand a million francs .
dimitrios would pay , believing we would come back for more , but we shall not be as foolish as to endanger our lives in that way .
we &apos;ll rest content with half a million each , mr .
leyden , and quietly disappear .
blackmail on a cash basis .
you really expect me to agree to this plan of yours , mr . peters ?
I don &apos;t think i quite understand , mr . leyden .
if this is a clumsy trick ... it is no trick , clumsy or otherwise .
you see , i &apos;m quite prepared in assisting blackmailing a person if that person is dimitrios , but i &apos;m not prepared to share in the profits .
so much the better for you , isn &apos;t it ?
Mr. Leyden , you are kind .
there &apos;s not enough kindness in the world .
not that again !
not that &quot; kindness in the world &quot; !
it &apos;s coming out of my ears .
but you are kind .
I prepared a letter for dimitrios , asking him to meet with us .
&quot; dear sir , the undersigned has just learned that he is an old acquaintance of yours dating back to 1929 ... &quot;
&quot; and would appreciate having a little chat with you . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m sure that you will find the talk immensely interesting . &quot;
&quot; kindly come to the ledru hotel , avenue ledru ,
&quot; tomorrow evening at 8 : 00 .
&quot; looking forward to seeing you .
I remain your old friend and associate , eric peterson . &quot;
P.s .
Oh , yes .
&quot; I have just learned of the passing
&quot; of our mutual friend , constantine gullus .
Regrettable . &quot;
do you think he &apos;ll come ?
most certainly .
how much ?
4 .
I have it .
all right .
my name is mr . peterson .
I made reservation by telephone .
Oh , yes . it will be 15 francs for one , 20 for two .
this gentlemen is not staying with me .
15 francs .
thank you .
up the stairs , down the hall , to your right .
I don &apos;t like this , mr .
peters , i don &apos;t like it .
what &apos;s to prevent dimitrios from coming up here and shooting us both ?
please , do not let your imagination run away with you .
dimitrios would not do that .
it would be too noisy and dangerous for him .
besides , that is not his way .
leyden :
it isn &apos;t ?
well , what is his way ?
he &apos;s a very cautious man .
he thinks carefully before he acts .
well , he got the letter this morning .
he had all day to think carefully .
I had weeks .
I tell you i know dimitrios .
I know how his mind works .
I am asking a million francs , that is not an exorbitant amount for dimitrios .
he will pay .
I will take the money and go instantly to the indies , where dimitrios will never find me .
that &apos;s fine for you . what about me ?
I don &apos;t feel like instantly going to the indies .
you have glasses ?
put them on .
put on your hat , too .
Oh , i see . Yes .
turn up the collar of your coat .
Yeah , that &apos;s a good idea .
sit in that corner where it will not be too light .
Yeah , that &apos;s better .
good . that &apos;ll do it .
my good friend , how are you ?
how are you ?
that is mr . Smith .
Mr. Smith .
he knew gullus ?
that is what we wanted to talk to you about , dimitrios .
then talk . I &apos;ve an appointment to keep .
you haven &apos;t changed at all , dimitrios , always impetuous , always a little unkind .
after all these years , no word of greeting , no word of regret for all the unhappiness you &apos;ve caused me .
I have an appointment to keep .
since you want to make this a purely business matter , we want money .
what do you have to give me in exchange ?
silence , dimitrios , very valuable .
how valuable ?
one million francs .
what do you think you know that &apos;s worth one million francs ?
so difficult to know where to begin .
there are so many things the police would like to know .
for instance , the identity of the man who tipped them off in 1931 to the smuggling ring .
I &apos;m sure they &apos;d be interested to know that it is the same man who today is a director of the eurasian credit trust .
you haven &apos;t told me anything yet that &apos;s worth one million francs .
it &apos;s childish .
you were always inclined to despise my simple approach to the problems of this life , but our silence on the matter would be worth something , would it not ?
not one million francs .
there &apos;s yugoslavia .
police of that country would be glad to know the whereabouts of dimitrios talat .
so grodek &apos;s been talking .
any more ?
then let us go to smyrna .
in 1922 , a moneylender named conrad- the murderer of conrad was hanged .
can that be true ?
perhaps mr . Smith has something to add to that .
abdul dhris was hanged , but he made a confession implicating a man named dimitrios makropoulos .
Mr. Smith saw the body of gullus and had no difficulty in identifying it with a photograph of gullus .
do you really think a million is exorbitant ?
I &apos;m wondering why you ask so little .
I do not like to be greedy .
I like to be fair ... always .
you &apos;ll have it ready in &quot; mille notes tomorrow .
if the instructions are not followed out exactly , you &apos;ll not be given a second chance .
do you understand ?
Mr. Smith ?
Yes ?
how is this man whom you took to be gullus dressed when he was found ?
Oh , in a cheap blue suit , and inside the coat there was an identification card .
and how was he killed ?
he was stabbed in the side and thrown into the water .
peters :
are you satisfied , dimitrios ?
what did you think of him ?
it &apos;s dimitrios , all right .
ruthless and primitive .
I was frightened .
dimitrios has that effect on people .
you frighten me .
I always knew you hated dimitrios , but i didn &apos;t know you hated him so much .
not until i saw him in this room .
then i knew i hated him enough to kill him .
I knew it !
what ?
listen , the trains .
I spent an hour in here this morning listening to them .
the ballard rail . be ready .
come .
one million francs .
did you ever see so much money at one time before ?
one million- beautiful thing , oh !
leyden :
is there a match somewhere ?
dimitrios :
little surprised , peterson ?
I &apos;m glad your friend smith is here , too .
it saves me the trouble of persuading you to give me his name and address .
peterson was always too ingenious , and ingenuity is never a substitute for intelligence .
he was my friend .
no , he wasn &apos;t my friend , but he was a nice man .
compared to you he was- you rotten , insane brute !

c &apos;mon boys , take him out .
alright , men .
looks like a bad back .
you are wasting your time , doctor .
- There &apos;s not much you can do for me .
- You can make it if you try .
I don &apos;t wanna make it like this .
leave me alone , please .
case for the Base Hospital .
base HOSPITAL No. 6 Sgt. JOHNNY MEADOW
I loved your snapshots you look exactly as I imagined you from your letters .
I only hope you &apos;ll think as much of me when you see me .
Rosemary
these are wonderful letters , Johnny .
you &apos;re lucky to have a girl like Rosemary to go back to .
- Is she pretty ?
- I have never seen her .
you haven &apos;t ?
but she sounds as so she &apos;s in love with you .
we have been writing to each other .
I saw her name in this book .
a SHROPSHIRE LAD
I hope this book will give someone as much pleasure as it has given me .
Rosemary Blake , Clifftop House , Monteflores , California
- Good evening , Ivy .
- Good evening , Hilda .
you may shut the door now , Ivy .
now the portrait , Ivy .
Rosemary dear , it &apos;s your birthday , darling .
and even if you can &apos;t be with us just now we have your picture we have our thoughts of you .
she is the most beautiful creature in the world , isn &apos;t she , Ivy ?
of course , she is .
sometimes I can hardly believe that she &apos;s my daughter .
you may turn on the lamps and we &apos;ll drink a birthday toast .
thank you , Hilda .
- Happy birthday , darling !
- Happy birthday , Rosemary .
she &apos;ll be so happy .
Johnny &apos;s coming home to her at last .
- Hilda ...
- Yes ?
I ...
I know you won &apos;t like me saying it but if that young man comes here ...
Ivy !
there &apos;s nothing to worry about I won &apos;t interfere with them .
actually I know how to mind my own business .
and you just mind yours .
of course , I will Hilda . I always have , haven &apos;t I ?
it couldn &apos;t be Johnny .
his telegram ​ ​ said tomorrow . he said he couldn &apos;t get here until tomorrow .
I forgot to tell you .
Dr. Schuyler phoned and said he will send a new doctor to introduce himself .
- What &apos;s his name ?
- Ross , I think . Leslie Ross .
have him come right in .
- Hilda , here is Dr. Ross .
- Dr. Ross , how nice of ...
good evening , Mrs. Blake .
I must apologize for not coming earlier , but Dr. Schuyler and I &apos;d been pretty busy getting by settling my new practice .
- A woman doctor !
- I &apos;m sorry .
if you &apos;re going to take all the men into the service
I &apos;m afraid we women all have to learn to put up with each other .
- You seem awfully young .
- Well , I do the best I can to get over that .
Hilda , Dr. Ross has to catch the train to San Francisco .
she came here just to do Dr. Schuyler a favor .
you did take me by surprise , doctor .
unfortunately that happens to me rather often .
you see , people are not quite used to women doctors .
it isn &apos;t that , I was thinking of my daughter .
- It &apos;s her birthday today
- She &apos;s lovely .
- Do you really think so ?
- Of course she is .
the portrait is good of course ...
no painter could capture the real Rosemary .
would you like a glass of sherry , doctor ?
no , thank you . I must catch my train , you know .
but I &apos;ll be back in a couple of days to take over Dr. Schuyler &apos;s practice .
- Who painted the portrait ?
- A Polish refugee .
I never could pronounce his name . poor fella , died last year .
well doctor , what did Dr. Schuyler tell you about me ?
very little .
however he did say that since I &apos;m to be the only doctor in town
I &apos;d better get acquainted with you , as your apt to need me .
- Why should I need you ?
- We are both in very good health .
- Really ?
I thought perhaps your condition ...
- My dear .
I do not need a doctor now .
nor do I expect to need one in the future .
thank you .
Mrs. Blake , I &apos;m not trying to force myself on you .
if you resent a women doctor as much as you seem to ,
I &apos;ll certainly be sure not to come here again uninvited .
Ivy , show Dr. Ross to the door .
I can find my own way out Thank you . good night .
good night .
don &apos;t you think you were very rude to her , Hilda ?
of course I was . I meant to be . I don &apos;t like a jealous woman .
- Jealous ?
- I could see the way she looked at Rosemary &apos;s picture .
she hated her for being prettier than she is .
tickets , please !
good evening , Sergeant . glad to be back ?
I certainly am .
Monteflores ?
nice little town . do you live there ?
- No . I &apos;m on the way to visit someone .
- Well . good luck .
a SHROPSHIRE LAD
- Good evening .
- Oh , good evening .
I &apos;m sorry , I mean ...
- Was there something about my book ?
- Yes .
I hope you won &apos;t misunderstand , but can you tell me your name ?
surely . I &apos;m Leslie Ross .
the book reminded me of someone , for a moment I thought you might be ...
well , somebody I never saw just heard about .
I must have a pretty strange expression on my face .
I admit I would have jumped if you &apos;d said ; Boo ! on the middle of that stare .
I really got that habit of going about frighting women and children .
Incidently , my name is John Meadows .
but you don &apos;t need to pay attention if you &apos;d prefer to read while you eat .
not at all , I &apos;ve read it so many times I practically know it by heart .
I have , too .
you know I guess it true almost everybody likes the SHROPSHIRE LAD .
- I really don &apos;t see why you should pay for my dinner .
it &apos;s one of my biggest moments in my life .
you &apos;re the first girl I &apos;ve been able to buy anything for almost two years .
was it as much fun as you thought it would be ?
- More , I &apos;ve had a swell time .
- So have I .
you know there &apos;s something I &apos;d like to know about you .
somehow I have the feeling that you must do something important .
pretty well too .
well it &apos;s no use . I might as well confess .
brace yourself , Sergeant . I &apos;m a doctor .
- A doctor ?
- Please do not say it that way ,
I &apos;m trying to cure myself from feeling like a freak .
you see most people feel that female doctors should be seen only in cages .
well , I don &apos;t .
only it &apos;s a little hard to think of anyone as attractive as you &apos;re being a doctor .
I &apos;m afraid it &apos;ll be years before I get over the handicap of what I look like .
- That &apos;s a handicap that a lot of women would give years for .
- Thank you .
but I &apos;d even thought of wearing a false beard during office hours .
you see I &apos;m taking over a practice in a small town , called Monteflores .
- Monteflores ? - Yes .
have you heard of it ?
that &apos;s where I am going . I wonder if you happen to know ...
take it easy , folks !
everything &apos;s under control .
as the table staff in the dining car , tell them to bring hot water and all the clean towels they &apos;ve got .
dining Car
- Adhesive tape .
- Right here , doctor .
can you help her out ?
all right now , just take it easy . take it easy .
towel .
there is an ambulance coming , doctor . why don &apos;t you
- leave this case to them ?
- Please don &apos;t bother me .
the ambulance is here . you can knock off now .
- What ?
- You can rest now .
- You can take over now , doctor .
- Come on , Leslie .
- You get in . I &apos;ll get our luggage to the driver .
- Right .
sure . it &apos;s easy to give a fello orders .
the chief said : &quot; take the doc and his friend to the nearest hotel . &quot;
&quot; get them room , bed , tickets on the first train tomorrow and a couple of drinks . &quot;
I said , &quot; Okay , I can promise the drinks , but the rooms ? &quot;
don &apos;t he know there &apos;s a war going on ?
- Hey , Sarge .
- Yeah ?
ain &apos;t she kind of young to be a doctor ?
here &apos;s the best doctor on this side of the Solomons .
Oh , that &apos;s good to hear even if it isn &apos;t true .
I &apos;m not kidding .
I &apos;ve seen doctors working in conditions you wouldn &apos;t believe .
I wanna tell you that tonight you were right in their class .
praise like that Sergeant is praise indeed .
Johnny , what &apos;s the matter ?
I &apos;ll be all right . let &apos;s not change the subject .
I was trying to tell you how swell I think you are .
you are kind Johnny , but I &apos;m very tired .
I &apos;ve had what you might call a hectic day .
Yeah , I guess a little &apos; sack duty &apos; wouldn &apos;t hurt anybody .
- &apos; Sack duty &apos; ?
- It &apos;s a marine word for hitting the hay .
- Good night , doctor .
- Good night .
Johnny ...
these aren &apos;t office hours . you don &apos;t have to call me , doctor .
good night , Leslie .
- Good morning .
- Good morning .
- Want to order , ma &apos;am ?
- Little later , thanks .
- Here &apos;s your &apos; Joe &apos; , sir .
- Thanks .
- Joe ?
- That &apos;s a marine word for coffee .
- The Marines have word for everything , haven &apos;t they ?
- Almost everything .
what &apos;s the marine word for , &apos; What &apos;s troubling you ? &apos; ?
they don &apos;t have a word .
look Johnny , we &apos;ve got to know each other because of the train accident .
well , what I &apos;m trying to say is , you don &apos;t have to do any explaining .
but I want to explain .
see , I started to tell you on the train when the smash-up came .
all right , Johnny .
that business about the book wasn &apos;t a gag ,
I picked it up at the Red Cross . there was a girl &apos;s name on the fly leaf
I liked the book so I wrote to her .
she wrote to me and theres something the way we thought and the way we saw things .
that &apos;s why you thought I might be the girl ?
when you saw my copy of the Shropshire Lad ?
Yeah of course . all I know about her is she lives in Monteflores , in a house on top of a cliff with her mother .
on top of a cliff ?
is her name Blake ?
Yes , Rosemary Blake . you know her ?
no .
no , but I &apos;ve seen her picture . she &apos;s lovely , Johnny .
Leslie , her letters saved my life .
I didn &apos;t have much to come back to .
it was only the thought of Rosemary that finally gave me any reason to live .
that &apos;s one of those things that happen only in war .
I know exactly how things can happen in war . or accidents .
of course , you must see her . Goodbye .
you know something Johnny ?
I have given hundreds of books to the Red Cross and not once did I think to put in my name and address .
I only wish I &apos;d known they &apos;re going to guys like you .
Ivy , come up here immediately !
Ivy , come here immediately !
what is it , Hilda ?
how many times do I have to tell you that flowers in Rosemary &apos;s room have to be changed every day !
- I &apos;m sorry , Hilda . - Go .
bring fresh flowers at once .
wouldn &apos;t you be ashamed now if Rosemary came home unexpectidly and found dead flowers in her room ?
someone &apos;s coming . hurry now !
danger
you gotta be careful with a car up here .
- And that &apos;s no kidding , Sergeant .
- It &apos;s certainly isn &apos;t .
- Keep the change .
- Thanks .
- Does Miss Rosemary Blake live here ?
- Yes , but she isn &apos;t at home .
well I telegraphed . I &apos;m John meadows
of course . I am Ms. Miller , Mrs. Blake &apos;s companion .
I &apos;m afraid , Rosemary may not be back today .
can you tell me when she will come back ?
you &apos;d be better come in .
Mr. Meadows , come right in .
- Mrs. Blake ?
- Yes , Mr. Meadows .
- Or would you rather I call you Sgt. ?
- Yes . Mr. does sound rather strange .
- Alright , then I &apos;ll call Johnny .
- I don &apos;t see any reason why you shouldn &apos;t .
- Sit here and have some tea with me . - Thank you .
Mrs. Blake , I don &apos;t know if Rosemary told you , that we ...
I think it might be easier for both of us if I tell you at once ... that Rosemary keeps no secrets from me .
she &apos;s told me everything about your correspondence
I can &apos;t tell you how much it meant me out there Mrs. Blake .
and to Rosemary .
I do not want to seem like a prying mother but ...
would you tell me what it was about Rosemary &apos;s letters that made you think you were in love with her .
well , that &apos;s not easy to say .
it &apos;s the way she thinks .
how she looks at things .
- I just can &apos;t seem to put into words .
- I think I can understand .
Miss Miller told me that Rosemary isn &apos;t here .
I &apos;m so sorry about that but it just couldn &apos;t be helped .
she &apos;ll be back in a few days . she &apos;ll telephone .
I know how difficult it is going to be for you .
waiting .
not at all . I imagine a few days in Monteflores will be very restful .
surely .
by the way , did Rosemary sent you a picture of herself ?
no , she didn &apos;t .
well , I don &apos;t think that was very nice of her .
she said , she didn &apos;t have a good one .
I &apos;m afraid she wasn &apos;t telling you the entire truth .
she has a picture and a very good one , too .
I &apos;m going to show it to you , after we had tea .
Yes , I &apos;d like to see it very much .
sit down , Johnny .
this is one time I don &apos;t mind you eavesdropping at all
- I wasn &apos;t ...
- You seem very nervous .
I &apos;ve got one of my headaches .
I &apos;m sorry . I wanted you to do something for me .
well , it &apos;s not too bad . what was it ?
Johnny is going to see Rosemary &apos;s picture for the first time .
go to the living room , roll the shades !
make the room as dark as you can .
- Right away ?
- Yes , yes , yes .
- Hilda ...
- Go ahead , Ivy .
- You can &apos;t go through with this .
- I won &apos;t have any interference .
I like that boy and Rosemary is going to like him .
I won &apos;t let anything happen to spoil his chances with her .
I want that completely understood .
- You wouldn &apos;t dare interfere .
- I didn &apos;t mean anything .
go ahead , do as you were told .
then leave us alone .
go in , Johnny .
- Is she what you expected , Johnny ?
- Yeah ...
I &apos;ve never imagined anything as lovely .
except Rosemary .
Johnny !
Johnny !
help , Ivy !
Johnny !
Hello , Thompson ! what &apos;s new ?
nothings ever new with people they get the same headaches year in and year out .
- Here , have some coffee .
- Thanks .
Tommy , why is that female doctor funny ?
I &apos;m a nurse , not a quiz show .
I only think it &apos;s only funny when your not one yourself .
Yeah , like being sea sick .
- Tommy !
- Better drink up and get on your horse again !
- Who is it this time ?
- In every town there is always one .
she thinks she is the Queen Mother and Queen Father to boot .
this one my dear doctor , is called Mrs. Morton Blake .
Mrs. Blake ?
she certainly must be sick to call me .
well ! here we go again . see you later Tommy .
good luck .
Oh doctor , my daughter &apos;s fiancee . his back , I don &apos;t know ...
- Leslie ...
- Leslie ?
you know him ?
- We met .
- We were on the same train .
don &apos;t worry , I think I &apos;ll be all right in a few minutes .
no , you stay right here until we can arrange to have you moved upstairs .
- Thank you very much , doctor .
- I &apos;ll stop in again tomorrow .
don &apos;t put yourself to any trouble . unless you think it &apos;s necessary .
I assure you , I wouldn &apos;t come back unless I thought it was necessary .
- Of course . Goodbye , doctor .
- Goodbye .
Dr. Ross .
- Yes ?
- I want to talk to you .
- Why ? of course .
- When can I see you ?
- Whenever you like .
- Then I &apos;ll come to the office tomorrow .
please , don &apos;t say anything about it to Mrs. Blake .
of course not , if you don &apos;t want me to .
thank you , doctor .
- What are you doing out there ?
- Nothing . I just came out for a moment .
- You &apos;re lying . you talked to that woman .
- No , I didn &apos;t Hilda .
I didn &apos;t even see her .
Hey , we caught us a real character out there . from that Blake menagerie .
name of Ivy Miller , got time for her ?
have I , bring her in even if you have to drag her .
okay , you &apos;re the doctor as the saying goes .
would you come in , please , Miss Miller ?
won &apos;t you come in ?
- Dr. Ross ...
- Now there &apos;s no reason to be nervous , Miss Miller .
- I know , but ... - Please sit down .
just as I told you , I &apos;m having terrible trouble getting to sleep .
if there &apos;s anything you can give me that will ...
I &apos;m afraid it &apos;ll be little difficult for me to prescribe anything .
- I know so little about you .
- There &apos;s nothing seriously wrong with me .
it &apos;s just that I &apos;m ... nervous , that &apos;s all .
there &apos;s always a reason for nervousness .
people have problems , conflicts . sometimes they &apos;re troubled by those about them .
there is nothing like that , doctor .
Mrs. Blake and I &apos;ve been good friends for years .
I must say that yesterday you gave me the impression you wanted to tell me something important .
I didn &apos;t mean to ...
I &apos;m sorry . I must have been mistaken .
I &apos;ll give you something to help you sleep .
- I , Dr. Ross ...
- Yes ?
I just hope it &apos;s strong . I really can &apos;t sleep .
I think you will find it strong enough .
you have to take this to Britton &apos;s Drug Store .
they are the only druggist in town who can fill it .
Dr. Ross , you &apos;re right , I haven &apos;t told you why I really came here .
I thought not . now why don &apos;t you sit down and tell me quietly .
it &apos;s about Rosemary and Mrs. Blake .
pardon me .
Hello ?
Oh , Mrs. Blake ...
no , no , no , no .
no , she isn &apos;t .
if she comes in , I &apos;ll be glad to give her your message .
Yes , I understand .
you have to excuse me now , Mrs. Blake . I &apos;m really very busy .
Goodbye .
what the heck did you do to her ?
she went out of here like a bat out of ... whatever bats go out of .
- What &apos;s it all about ?
- I don &apos;t know yet .
give me the Britton &apos;s Drug Store Tommy . I want to talk to Mr. Britton .
good morning .
dear , I &apos;m so clumsy . I do hope I didn &apos;t disturb you .
not at all . as matter of fact , I was rather hoping you &apos;ll be around .
thank you . is it alright for you to be out of bed ?
I &apos;m feeling much better . Dr. Ross told me over the phone , I might get up today .
she is an awfully nice girl , isn &apos;t she , Mr. Meadows ?
I &apos;m not Mr. Meadows , Miss Ivy .
Johnny isn &apos;t a terrible hard word to say , is it ?
I &apos;ll try .
it certainly would look funny if anyone came in right now , wouldn &apos;t it ?
Yeah , more or less if we were a high class crap game using flowers for dice .
Miss Ivy , I wonder if you could tell me something . it &apos;s very important to me .
I will if I can .
when is Rosemary coming home ?
didn &apos;t Mrs. Blake tell you ?
I &apos;ll be frank with you Miss Ivy ,
the reason I &apos;ve asked you because Mrs. Blake doesn &apos;t seem to want to say .
she may have her reasons , of course ... but she keeps telling me to wait and that Rosemary will be here .
- But she won &apos;t tell me when .
- I don &apos;t know anything .
you &apos;ll have to find out from Mrs. Blake .
well , there is something I &apos;m sure you could tell me however .
- Who painted Rosemary &apos;s portrait ?
- I do not know .
Oh , you see . I studied painting in San Francisco , before I joined up .
I know that technique .
- Are you sure you don &apos;t know the name of the artist ?
- No , I don &apos;t .
Mrs. Blake could tell you , Mr ...
Johnny .
okay , I &apos;ll ask her .
Johnny , what are you doing out of bed ?
- Mrs. Blake , I wondered if you could tell me ... ?
- You don &apos;t have to tell me .
because I know , you went down to see Rosemary &apos;s portrait , didn &apos;t you ?
who painted Rosemary &apos;s portrait Mrs. Blake ?
I think I know the man who did it .
do you ?
well , I can &apos;t recall his name but I &apos;m sure I know him .
I have a surprise for you . come .
come in , Johnny . come .
this is Rosemary &apos;s room .
her own room .
it really is beautiful , isn &apos;t it ?
she has wonderful taste , Johnny .
Mrs. Blake , where is Rosemary ?
- I have been here two days now and I still don &apos;t know .
- Johnny ...
I promise you , you &apos;ll see her . and soon .
come , I &apos;ll show more of the real Rosemary .
she has beautiful taste in everything .
can you smell the perfume ?
the rarest I could get for her .
this perfume makes me feel almost as if she were here .
right with us in this room . can you feel her presence here , Johnny ?
Mrs. Blake I don &apos;t like being here . I feel if we were spying or something .
if you &apos;ll excuse me , I &apos;d like to leave .
Ivy .
would you tell Mrs. Blake I &apos;m going into town to see Dr. Ross ?
- Oh , is anything wrong , Johnny ?
- No , I &apos;m fine .
- Well if you wait we &apos;ll drive you into town .
- No thanks , a hike will do me good .
- Ivy , where did Johnny go ?
- He went into town to see the doctor .
- Doctor ?
why Is he ill ?
- I don &apos;t think so .
what does she want with him ?
Ivy , get the car .
- Thank you , Doctor .
- Goodbye .
- We &apos;re doing better .
- No flatters .
the only reason were doing any bit is the poor fellow happened to get his hand caught in a mowing machine .
I &apos;m tired , Tommy . how about getting me some Joe ?
getting you some what ?
Joe is marine slang for coffee .
my , how you get around ?
I ought to call the Blake house .
looks like the Blake house is coming to see you .
- Who ?
- A Randy Dandy .
a what ?
nurses &apos; slang for a marine .
Hello , Johnny . how do you feel ?
fine . there &apos;s something I want to talk to you about .
I think I &apos;d better have a look just the same .
well , all right . but I can tell you right now , first rate .
I &apos;m practically a cured man .
that &apos;s for the doctor to say .
and when she &apos;s through saying you think she may be called upon for some non-professional advise ?
if it will please the patient , but now the back .
- Leslie ...
- Face down , please .
- Does that hurt ?
- Just a little sensitive . but that &apos;s not what bothers me .
what does ?
that &apos;s where non-professional advice comes in .
you can get up now , Johnny .
Leslie , is something going on at the Blake house ?
well , I just can &apos;t understand it .
- You &apos;re out of uniform , Sergeant .
- Sorry .
now , you can tell the doctor your troubles .
I don &apos;t wanna talk to a doctor , I wanna talk to you .
it &apos;s about Rosemary .
- She isn &apos;t back , is she ?
- No , that &apos;s what bothers me .
now let &apos;s examine this calmly Johnny .
after all you yourself are on a highly emotional state .
the feeling you have there being something wrong might be just your imagination .
now when Rosemary comes home tomorrow or the next day you will find that everything is perfect .
perfectly natural .
but there must be some reason Mrs. Blake keeps putting me off .
there must be something the matter with Rosemary .
something that her mother &apos;s afraid to tell me .
chances are , she is visiting friends or way at college .
no , I don &apos;t think so . there is something ...
I &apos;ve got it !
- You &apos;ve got what , Johnny ?
- The portrait .
Leslie , I thought I recognized that technique .
I know somebody who could tell me about Rosemary .
good morning . is Dr. Ross in ?
Yes , but she has a patient in her office now .
- If you &apos;d have a chair .
- Thank you .
I &apos;m positive it was Paul Arnheim . you see we went to school together .
when you mentioned college a while ago it gave me his name , Paul Arnheim .
since he painted the girl , he knows her .
I &apos;m going to San Francisco to have a talk with him .
what &apos;s the matter Leslie ?
cold ?
no . somebody just walked over my grave .
Leslie . listen to me .
you know I &apos;m so keen about finding Rosemary ?
I have to find her to tell her I &apos;m not in love with her .
because I &apos;m in love with someone else .
Johnny ...
Ivy !
Ivy !
Yes , Hilda , what is it ?
tomorrow morning , get me the address of the Medical Association .
what you are going to do , Hilda ?
you &apos;re not going to hurt Dr. Ross ?
you mustn &apos;t plan anything to harm her .
what you &apos;re planning to do is wicked and evil ?
there is only one wicked thing I know Ivy .
I will not permit anyone to come between Rosemary and Johnny .
I don &apos;t care who it is . Dr. Ross ...
- Or you .
- Hilda , think what you &apos;re saying .
answer the phone .
Mrs. Blake &apos;s residence .
Yes .
- Very well , I &apos;ll tell her .
- Who is it ?
it &apos;s Mr. Meadows . he won &apos;t be back tonight .
he is going to San Francisco .
give me that phone .
Hello . Johnny ?
Johnny ?
Hello ?
Johnny ?
Hello ?
whatever she &apos;s done , or whatever she does , she is really not responsible .
Hilda Blake is a very sick woman .
Ivy Miller
good morning , Hilda . it &apos;s a lovely morning , isn &apos;t it ?
Yes , it is . good morning .
Hello ?
Yes , this is Mrs. Blake &apos;s residence .
Hello , Dr. Ross .
Yes , this is Miss Miller speaking .
I just called to see how you are feeling ?
good . you &apos;ll just keep on taking the prescription .
no , there &apos;s nothing else I can think of at the moment .
are you sure there &apos;s nothing else ?
nothing else ?
- Who is it , Ivy ?
- It &apos;s Dr. Ross .
she wants to know how I &apos;m feeling . that &apos;s all .
thanks for calling , Doctor . Goodbye .
Oh , very thoughtful of her .
you must have a great deal of confidence in Dr. Ross .
I do have .
take that away .
- You think she will help you ?
- Oh , yes .
- In what way ?
- In many ways , Hilda .
light the fire Ivy .
I don &apos;t think the doctor will help you very much , Ivy .
why not ?
you seem very sure of yourself tonight . something new , it becomes you .
I &apos;m your friend , Hilda .
and yet you defend that Leslie woman .
what &apos;s so wrong , Hilda ?
have you forgotten that Johnny is engaged to Rosemary ?
Hilda . when will you stop saying that ?
- And the letters . what about them ?
- The letters . why won &apos;t you face the fact ?
the fact is that I have a daughter .
- Hilda , sooner or later ...
- Sooner or later . what ?
everybody will know . nothing can prevent it .
not even you , huh , Ivy ?
Ivy , darling . you know ?
I don &apos;t think you &apos;re really , very bright .
Hilda ...
it &apos;s all right , Ivy .
there &apos;s nothing to worry about .
we &apos;ll talk about this tomorrow , shall we ?
I &apos;d like to try to get some sleep tonight .
good night , Ivy .
sleep well .
- Who ?
who is it ?
- It &apos;s Hilda .
you sounded so restless .
I thought this milk will be good for you .
you were never so thoughtful before , Hilda .
I &apos;ve never realized before that I had such a good friend in you .
if you &apos;s only listened to me , Hilda . I &apos;m your good friend .
here Ivy , it &apos;ll be good for you .
no , I don &apos;t want it .
don &apos;t be foolish .
Ivy , you silly child , it &apos;s only milk . look .
why should I want to harm you ?
Oh , forgive me , Hilda . forgive me .
try to forgive me .
please , try to forget . please , do .
here , drink it .
it &apos;ll be good for you .
I am forgiven .
you are my friend .
that will put you to sleep .
good night , Hilda .
Veronal CAUTION :
take AS PRESCRIBED .
they will find out anyway , Hilda .
they will find out ... anyway .
Dr. Ross !
you seem surprised this evening , Mrs. Blake .
didn &apos;t Sergeant Meadows tell you that I was coming ?
he isn &apos;t here , but ...
please , come in anyway .
he left a message with my nurse . he asked me to meet him here .
he is in San Francisco .
I guess he expects to be back shortly .
come in , please .
why do you insist on staring at me ?
I &apos;m sorry Mrs. Blake but I was not aware of it .
have you never seen anybody like me before ?
perhaps you &apos;d prefer that I wait for the Sergeant in my car .
excuse me , I &apos;ve been so upset these last days .
Johnny &apos;s coming to the house and Rosemary my daughter not here when he arrives .
children don &apos;t appreciate half the things that parents do for them .
but Rosemary will be here soon and everything will be over with .
except my loneliness .
Mrs. Blake , I hope you don &apos;t mind me asking you a question .
of course , not .
being a doctor I &apos;ll accept your answer as matter of confidence .
what do you want to know ?
is your daughter by any chance an adopted child ?
well ...
there &apos;s her portrait . don &apos;t you see the resemblance ?
it &apos;s difficult to say .
what do you mean ?
from physiological point of view , it occurred to me that you might not be able to bare a child .
well , doctor ,
I &apos;m certainly glad I &apos;m not your patient .
I could be wrong , Mrs. Blake .
not quite , Leslie .
Mrs. Blake , Rosemary will never be back .
Johnny , how can you say that ?
- Because there is no Rosemary .
- Johnny !
she paid Paul Arnheim 1000 dollars to paint portray of an imaginary girl .
I saw him this afternoon in San Francisco .
Johnny ...
Mrs. Blake , I had to find your daughter to tell her that the whole thing was a mistake .
Rosemary !
why did you do it , Mrs. Blake ?
you were right , doctor .
I couldn &apos;t have a child .
have you ever known what it is to be lonely ?
to want a child and not to be able to have one ?
have you ever been so dreadfully unhappy that you permit nothing to come between you and what you wanted ?
even it was only fiction .
Yes , I created a daughter .
out of nothing , nothing from a great passion to have one .
to work , scheming , pain .
it took lies one more gigantic than the other
I kept moving from town to town just as often as I saw someone suspected the truth .
and then your letter came , Johnny .
it was the first time , Rosemary had a beau .
can you blame me for encouraging you , Johnny ?
for one thing , a few days of the joy of knowing what it was like to be a mother .
to be loved ?
and then when you ... came to tell me that it was her mind you loved .
you gave me the happiest day I &apos;ve ever known .
because it was my mind you were talking about .
you were loving me , Johnny .
can you forget and forgive an old lady ?
an old lady &apos;s foolish dreams ?
I think we can understand , Mrs. Blake .
well doctor , I suppose you are the lucky girl .
- The real one .
- Yes , and we gonna be married .
then let &apos;s celebrate .
I have some imported wine .
- Let me help you .
- Oh no , thank you . I &apos;ll do it myself .
to your happiness .
- Thank you , Mrs. Blake .
- My thanks too .
shall we drink ?
wait a minute , where is Miss Ivy ?
she is in bed . she hasn &apos;t been feeling very well lately .
Oh , let &apos;s call her anyway . after all I &apos;m not getting married every day on the week ?
- I &apos;ll ask her to come down .
- Oh , I wouldn &apos;t disturb her .
very fortunate doctor , I realized now how much Rosemary will lose .
Mrs. Blake . you must give Rosemary up .
Yes , of course . of course ...
Leslie !
Leslie ! come up here .
- When did they say the ambulance will get here ?
- About an hour .
wasn &apos;t there anything you could do for her ?
no , Johnny . it was too late when I got to her .
doctor !
since you diagnosed the cause of Ivy &apos;s death , as an overdose of Veronal ,
I hold you responsible .
- Now wait a minute .
- Johnny .
you &apos;ve not only come between Rosemary and Johnny but you &apos;ve killed the one friend I had , in the world .
Mrs. Blake ,
Miss Ivy either committed suicide or ...
or what ?
or she was murdered .
I do not understand you .
it &apos;s very simple .
you see , there was no Veronal in the mixture I prescribed for Ms. Ivy .
there was nothing stronger than a few grains of phenobarbital .
the whole bottle would not have killed a fly .
but the label said ...
Miss Ivy needed psychiatric treatment more than medication .
I gave the one disguised as the other .
I see .
there is nothing left for me to do but ... to tell you that Ivy killed herself .
I was trying to keep it from becoming generally known .
how do you know ?
I know ...
she left me a letter .
please , wait . I &apos;ll bring it to you .
where is the letter , Mrs. Blake ?
I &apos;ve decided that there &apos;s no reason why you should see it .
and please now , will you be good enough to leave my house .
come on , let &apos;s go .
good night .
Rosemary , darling .
when those wicked people are out of the way , no one will know .
just wait . wait .
- You want me to drive ?
- Yes , darling
- You got the keys ?
- Why no they &apos;re in the car .
- That &apos;s funny . I don &apos;t remember locking it .
- I &apos;ll get in from the other side .
Johnny !
that was a narrow escape ,
I weighed 5 pounds more I &apos;d be crow bait by now .
a fella goes through Guadalcanal ...
- Johnny , look !
- A booby trap .
she tried to kill us , Johnny .
nothing stands in our way now .
police department ?
this is Mrs. Blake . Mrs. Morton Blake &apos;s speaking .
33 Cliff ton Road .
there has just been an accident .
two people have fallen off the cliff .
Dr. Ross and a friend of hers . they have just left my house .
we &apos;ll just wait with you , Mrs. Blake until they come .
Rosemary , darling .
now you &apos;ve got to help me .
help me !
help me ...
the END
they call them &quot; the haunted shores &quot; ... these stretches of Devonshire and Cornwall and Ireland ... which rear up against the westward ocean .
Mists gather here , and sea fog ... and eerie stories .
that &apos;s not &apos; because there are more ghosts here than in other places , mind you .
it &apos;s just that people who live hereabouts ... are strangely aware of them .
you see , day and night , year in , year out ... they listen to the pound and stir of the waves .
there &apos;s life and death in that restless sound ... and eternity too .
if you listen to it long enough , all your senses are sharpened .
you come by strange instincts .
you get to recognize a peculiar cold . ..
which is the first warning - a cold which is no mere matter of degrees Fahrenheit ... but a draining of warmth from the vital centers of the living .
local people tell me they would have felt it ... even outside that locked door .
we didn &apos;t .
they can &apos;t understand why we didn &apos;t know what it meant ... when our dog wouldn &apos;t go up those stairs .
animals see the blasted things , it appears .
well , my sister Pamela and I knew nothing about such matters - not then , we didn &apos;t .
we had the disadvantage of being Londoners ... just down for a fortnight &apos;s rest .
that tenth day of May 1937 was the end of our holiday .
we seem to be in somebody &apos;s garden .
what was somebody &apos;s garden .
what a marvelous old house !
we &apos;d better get out before we &apos;re had up for trespassing .
- Where on earth did we leave the car ?
- That direction , I think .
look , a squirrel .
- Grab Bobby ! - Too late .
Bobby , come back here !
you bad dog !
Bobby !
he &apos;s got the poor little squirrel trapped . he &apos;ll kill it .
my dear , sweet sister , it &apos;s more likely he &apos;s having his way with our Bobby .
fine way to spend a holiday - chasing a dog !
- Where is he ?
- Under here , I think .
- Ow ! - I thought you had him .
- He had me . there he goes !
hang on to Bobby !
- I can &apos;t !
Oh , well played , sir !
- Do you suppose he can get out ?
- Certainly . he &apos;s on the roof by now .
that &apos;s a smart dog . he &apos;ll be back any minute .
Rick , have you noticed anything ?
- Only that I &apos;m in no shape to join the hunting set .
- No , I mean this house .
it &apos;s the loveliest thing I ever saw .
look at that staircase .
Oh , boy , what banisters for sliding !
- Oh , Rick .
- What is it ?
your saying that , and the house - it took me back .
- Yeah , it &apos;s quite a bit like the -
- The rose bowl there ... the grandfather clock there ... and Mother in her best gray moire sweeping down the stairs .
- You &apos;ll be howling in a minute . come out .
- Not on your life .
I &apos;m going to see the rest of this . come on . let &apos;s pretend we &apos;re buying it .
I &apos;ll toss you for the bedroom with the best view .
they &apos;ve all got best views .
how lovely !
why does it make me feel I &apos;m on a boat ?
it &apos;s the light on the ceiling . that &apos;s the sea .
it &apos;s nice to wake up and see that .
Oh , how I do hate living in a London flat .
if you &apos;re brought up in an old house , you always hanker for one .
it &apos;s stuck . you try it .
it &apos;s locked . family skeletons , probably .
Oh , what a bore .
Rick , the bathroom !
an open fire while you bathe . what luxury !
you know , this is a Saturday-night-only bathroom .
you boiled yourself as red as a lobster , then hurried to bed to avoid a chill .
- Rick .
- What ?
I &apos;ve had one of my feelings . we &apos;re really going to buy this house .
Oh , yes ?
did your feeling tell you what we &apos;re going to buy it with ?
if we both put in everything we have , maybe we can get it .
it &apos;s terribly out of the way , and it hasn &apos;t been lived in for years .
but what would we do with it ?
we can &apos;t drive nearly 300 miles just for weekends .
we &apos;ll live here all the time , and you &apos;ll work at your music .
my poor lunatic sister , I happen to have a job .
Yes , and what a job - going to concerts ... and telling your readers how bad the music was .
it &apos;s not good enough , Rick . chuck it .
down here you &apos;d write your own music , as you always should have done ... and as you &apos;ve always wanted to .
Rick , it isn &apos;t as if you were even a good music critic .
well , thank you very much . anyway , I get paid hard cash .
well , doesn &apos;t the idea attract you at all ?
attract me ?
look , you come out of here . you &apos;re dangerous .
don &apos;t you know how rare houses like this are ?
- I like the banisters .
- How Lizzie &apos; d love that kitchen .
that little beach must belong to it .
it &apos;s in good condition too . not a sign of damp .
- We &apos;ll get our furniture out of storage -
- Be calm , Pamela .
a change like this would have to be discussed for months .
nonsense . important decisions have to be made quickly .
well , my paper has asked me to do a series -
&quot; lives of the great musicians . &quot; two minutes .
- There you are . that &apos;ll feed us .
- Yes , until I run out of musicians .
anyway , how do we know the place is for sale ?
Rick , life isn &apos;t as cruel as that . it &apos;s got to be .
now remember , Pam , no signs of keenness .
we &apos;re just mildly interested . mildly .
Shh !
- Good afternoon .
- Good afternoon .
we &apos; d like to see Commander Beech , if we may .
- He &apos;s not in at the moment .
- Could we wait for him ?
won &apos;t you come in ?
there &apos;s a fire in the study .
I think I can catch my grandfather by telephone .
- Who shall I say wants to see him ?
- He wouldn &apos;t know our name .
it &apos;s Fitzgerald .
my sister , Pamela Fitzgerald , and I &apos;m Roderick Fitzgerald .
- How do you do ?
- How do you do ?
I &apos;m Stella Meredith .
won &apos;t you sit down ?
thank you .
Oh , not in that chair ! it &apos;s got a lumpy seat .
- Do you mind ?
- Oh , no .
- Oh , dear . will this do ?
- Thank you .
what an awfully un-smoking house .
grandfather had a cigar blown straight down his throat once when he was on the foredeck .
he lost his taste for tobacco .
can I help in any way ?
we wanted to talk to the commander about a house he owns ... on top of the cliff .
- Windward ?
- Yes .
you see , we &apos;ve fallen head over heels in love with -
I mean , it might just do for us .
really ?
we understand from Mrs. Brown at the inn ifs for sale .
Mrs. Brown is mistaken . sorry you &apos;ve been put to the trouble of coming here .
perhaps if we could speak to your grandfather about it -
it wouldn &apos;t be the slightest use .
I &apos;m sorry , but there &apos;s really no point in your waiting .
Stella , are you there ?
Yes , Grandfather .
in here .
well , what is it ?
some people who came here by mistake , Grandfather . they &apos;re just leaving .
we heard that Windward House is for sale .
Yes , it is .
won &apos;t you sit down ? I &apos;ll be with you in a moment .
thank you very much .
grandfather , please .
I thought I made myself quite clear on this point , Stella .
- Yes , Grandfather -
- I don &apos;t understand you .
a house you haven &apos;t lived in since you were a child ... a piece of property we can &apos;t afford to maintain .
but it was my mother &apos;s house . it &apos;s -
- I can &apos;t put it into words . it &apos;s -
- Nonsense .
grandfather , please !
I don &apos;t believe many repairs will be necessary .
the roof is sound ... and the walls have withstood the Atlantic gales for two centuries .
- Thank you .
- Thank you .
there was a considerable sum spent on the house some 20 years ago ... when I gave it to my daughter .
I understand .
well , I &apos;m sorry ... but I &apos;m afraid £ 1,200 is our absolute limit .
- Is that a definite offer ?
- Yes .
and you would pay the entire sum immediately ?
- You mean you &apos;d sell for that ?
- Yes .
I suppose you ought to have the property surveyed before we -
- Oh , Rick .
- There &apos;s no need to get suspicious .
the house is worth far more than that ... but I have a very young granddaughter ... and £ 1,200 in the bank for her would ease my mind considerably .
we understand perfectly .
and you &apos;d not be nervous in such a lonely house ?
no , indeed .
or of the wind at nights ?
it plays odd tricks in old houses .
are you trying to tell us the house is haunted ?
no , Miss Fitzgerald . no house is haunted .
but I had some tenants five years ago ... who complained of ...
disturbances .
what was the trouble ?
ladies carrying their heads under their arms ?
I declined to discuss it and canceled the lease .
but I couldn &apos;t cancel a sale .
we wouldn &apos;t want you to .
one does feel that a story like that should bring the price down .
I &apos;ve already made a very considerable reduction , Mr. Fitzgerald .
perhaps we both need time to think the matter over .
- But our offer &apos;s definite . isn &apos;t it , Rick ?
- Oh , yes .
very well , then . I accept it .
title deeds and checks will be exchanged by our solicitors .
in the meantime , I have your word ... and you have mine .
well , it &apos;s wonderfully simple to buy a house , isn &apos;t it ?
Pam , where are you ?
here I am . look , our own roses .
Rick , it &apos;s all ours . isn &apos;t it wonderful ?
Hmm . you know , it &apos;s bigger than I thought .
I can &apos;t wait to see what &apos;s in that Bluebeard room .
probably the housemaid &apos;s cupboard - slops , mops , dripping taps .
I wonder how soon we can get cleaners and painters in .
you &apos;ll go back to London , of course , while I stay here .
rolled up in a blanket like a squaw ?
at the inn , idiot , until you ship me the furniture .
did the old boy tell you why it was locked ?
never thought to ask him .
well , now we know .
it &apos;s the one ugly room in the house .
Oh , it &apos;s not so bad .
that window - it &apos;s like a cucumber frame .
they put that in later to make a painter &apos;s studio .
even the view doesn &apos;t cheer it up .
- What &apos;ll we do with it ?
- My workroom , of course .
it &apos;s ideal .
put the piano over there with shelves for music ... plenty of space to walk up and down , manuscripts all over the floor ... hot pincers to tear the flesh from people who keep telling me luncheon is ready ... stacks of checks from my publishers , and -
- Do you think this room is damp ?
- It needs airing .
it &apos;s funny it should strike so cold in here after such a warm day .
- Oh , law .
- What , Rick ?
I suddenly felt completely flattened .
do you suppose I &apos;ll ever be able to write any music here or anywhere ?
what on earth are you talking about ?
you don &apos;t suppose we &apos;ve made the most howling mistake , do you ?
Rick , have we ?
why did the commander suddenly come down in his price like that ?
the disturbances . rumors like that are dynamite if you &apos;re selling a place .
Yes . Pamela , you &apos;re not going to get scared of this ghost business , are you ?
of course not , Rick .
I don &apos;t believe in them , really ... and I &apos;d be interested , not scared , wouldn &apos;t you ?
me ?
no , disturbances wouldn &apos;t disturb me , not for a single second .
- it &apos;s Bobby !
- Of course it &apos;s Bobby .
now don &apos;t go getting imaginative .
it is rather a filthy room , isn &apos;t it ?
we &apos;re here , Bobby .
he &apos;s trying to tell us about the squirrel , I expect .
didn &apos;t he keep his date with you ?
why don &apos;t you come up , stupid ?
Rick , look at that lamb of a window !
never thought Bobby was a killer at heart .
who &apos;s that standing out there ?
looks like the old boy &apos;s granddaughter .
don &apos;t waste a wave on that one .
because she didn &apos;t want us to buy the house ?
- I think she &apos;d been crying .
- Had she ?
don &apos;t you see ?
she adored the house , and we &apos;ve cast her out .
- Isn &apos;t it awful ?
- Stop making up stories .
she didn &apos;t live here . she just doesn &apos;t want us to .
she &apos;s an ill-mannered little dog in the manger .
all right , Bobby .
we &apos;ll take you back to the inn ... and let you order your dinner .
- Have you forgotten something ? - Huh-uh .
no .
on second thought ... my landing gear isn &apos;t what it used to be .
- Morning , sir .
- Morning .
- Twenty Turrets , please .
- Yes , sir .
- Isn &apos;t this Windward House ?
- Yes , sir . fine house too .
glad to hear there &apos;ll be folk in it again .
- You have a dozen of these ?
- Likely I have .
Oh , maybe you &apos;re the new owner .
Yes , my sister and I bought the place yesterday .
well , well . I hope you &apos;ll bring it back to itself again .
the last lot that lived there weren &apos;t no good .
went away owing money .
got out of their lease starting ugly stories about the place .
- So that &apos;s how the rumors started .
- That &apos;s what I do say .
here you are , sir . nine seems to be all I have .
- That &apos;s all right .
- Of course , there are others say different .
- There are ?
- Well , that &apos;s only natural ... after the way the lady of Windward House died ...
God rest her soul .
you mean the commander &apos;s daughter ?
only child . come near breaking the old gentleman &apos;s heart .
- He &apos;s never been the same since .
- How did she die ?
- Fell off the cliff .
- Accident ?
that &apos;s what I do say .
good morning , Mr. Hardy .
- A copy of Amateur Gardening , please .
- Yes , Mrs. Coatesworthy .
well , the best of luck to you , sir .
if you have a favorite tobacco , I &apos;ll be glad to stock it .
thank you . Good-bye .
the gent that just bought Windward House .
you don &apos;t say .
- Mr. Fitzgerald ?
- Yes ?
- Oh , it &apos;s you .
- May I speak to you for a moment ?
look here , young lady ... if you want to talk me out of Windward House , save your breath .
it isn &apos;t that . it &apos;s about me , yesterday afternoon .
my behavior was inexcusable .
- Come now . it wasn &apos;t as bad as all that .
- Thank you very much .
your grandfather made you apologize , didn &apos;t he ?
Oh , no . it was my mother .
your moth-
but I understood that - I beg your pardon ?
I kept looking at her last night , thinking how I &apos;d let her down .
- But isn &apos;t your mother dead ?
- Yes , but I know all about her .
from Grandfather , of course . I was only three when she died .
but I thought you said you looked at her .
her portrait hangs in my room . my father painted it .
Oh , then it was his studio .
Yes , and she was so beautiful .
let &apos;s go for a walk .
grandfather will never get over her death .
- He &apos;s hated Windward ever since .
- That &apos;s understandable .
but it isn &apos;t fair to hate a house because someone &apos;s died there .
I love Windward because she lived there for three years ... and those were my years .
and that &apos;s why you don &apos;t want anyone else to live in it ?
- That &apos;s foolish , isn &apos;t it ?
- No , just one thing is foolish :
you &apos;re living somebody else &apos;s life .
- How old are you , Stella Meredith ?
- Twenty .
you &apos;re 20 , and you &apos;re pretty .
you shouldn &apos;t be wasting a single second looking back on three little years .
- You should be having fun .
- I am .
Oh , nonsense !
what are you doing today , for instance ?
- Oh , just things .
- Facts , details .
Oh , dear .
I &apos;ve got to match some wool .
then I have to stop at the library and get a copy of Bleak House .
grandfather and I are reading Dickens .
you &apos;re not going to do any of those things . I have a much better idea .
isn &apos;t this better than reading to Grandfather ?
Oh , it &apos;s wonderful .
ever get seasick ?
fortunately , I have a stomach like Gibraltar .
not externally , of course .
- Are you asleep ?
- No .
just wondering if our national confidence in Gibraltar isn &apos;t misplaced .
shouldn &apos;t you get out of the sun ?
no , I &apos;d -
I &apos;d rather ... remain here .
Oh , please ! the tiller - please !
smells good .
that &apos;s mimosa . it was my mo-
Oh , I forgot . I &apos;m not supposed to talk about that .
- Why ?
- Out of the past .
- Oh , go ahead .
- It was my mother &apos;s favorite perfume .
my father sent me a bottle before he died .
I &apos;ve made it last a long time .
mimosa . ever see it growing ?
- No , I haven &apos;t .
- Like a million little yellow bells .
like -
like sleigh bells .
it &apos;s smooth again . are you feeling better ?
Oh , yes . I was about to resume command .
bring her about sharply . head straight for the jetty .
Avast the boom . scuttle the funnels .
lady , please !
I thought you &apos;d gone off for London , Mr. Fitzgerald .
- Just leaving now , Ben .
- That &apos;d be half a crown .
- You doing up your hair again ?
- Yes .
no , no , no !
come on .
it &apos;s wonderful like this , all loose and free and windblown .
what am I doing ?
talking high poetry or selling hairstyle advertising ?
- You laugh at everything , don &apos;t you ?
- Too much ?
no . it &apos;s just I &apos;ve never known anyone who laughed much .
see a lot of Pamela while I &apos;m away , will you ?
- How long will you be gone ?
- About three weeks .
perhaps she &apos;ll let me help her with the curtains and things .
get her to talk about me - in a respectful way , of course .
none of those anecdotes where I &apos;m the family half-wit .
I hope you have a nice trip .
- I &apos;ll take you home first .
- You &apos;re so late starting .
might as well .
I &apos;d rather break it gently to Grandfather about our sail , if you don &apos;t mind .
all right . gently but firmly , mind .
- Good-bye .
- Bye .
- Oh , Mr. Fitzgerald -
- Yes ?
I almost forgot to say it .
I &apos;m awfully happy you and your sister are going to live at Windward .
why , thank you , Stella Meredith !
well , here we are .
what a grand house , Master Rick . &apos; tis a mansion , so &apos; tis .
are you worthy of it , Lizzie Flynn ?
that &apos;s what I keep asking myself .
&apos;Tis on top of the world .
- Rick !
- Hello , Pam .
- Baby darling !
- Lizzie !
Oh , you devil for being late .
I wanted you to see everything while it was still daylight .
Ah , Master Rick and his friends and their cocktails .
- Got Lizzie drunk .
- Get on with you , Master Rick .
- Oh , Bobby !
- Where &apos;s our Bobby ?
- Don &apos;t , Rick .
- Something happen to him ?
nothing tragic . he just wandered away .
I suppose I haven &apos;t enough dog appeal .
- No , seriously , Pam .
- He loathed the country .
you know , no nice dustbins and no sporting interest in finding a tree .
Hmm . never heard of a terrier walking out .
Ah , Miss Pamela , I &apos;m dreaming on me feet .
Pam , it &apos;s perfect . you &apos;re practically straight .
there &apos;s some soup in the kitchen .
look at Whiskey now . he knows where the food is .
- How did the furniture fit in ?
- Beautifully .
I saw the grandfather clock . it waved both hands at me .
if the soup &apos;s burned , Lizzie will spank me .
get along with you , miss .
the saints be praised !
there &apos;s me old rocker .
it &apos;s been 1O years since you nestled your bustle in that .
- You &apos;ve done wonders , Pam .
- Thanks .
tell me , what does Stella think of the changes ?
- You mean Stella Meredith ?
- Mm-hmm .
- I haven &apos;t set eyes on her .
- You haven &apos;t ?
I did write and ask her to tea .
got a reply from the commander ... saying she wasn &apos;t strong enough to accept invitations .
not strong enough ?
I expect it &apos;s us . we just aren &apos;t nice to know .
but Stella was crazy to make friends with you . she told me .
but where did you see her ?
Hmm ? Oh , uh , just before I left for London .
why , you colossal bluff !
you were just as sorry for that child as I was .
stop pushing her into the nursery . she &apos;s 20 . she said so herself .
you like her .
I can &apos;t help it .
there &apos;s kind of a sleeping-beauty magic about the kid .
I &apos;d thought I &apos;d clone something toward breaking the spell .
seems not .
Prince Charmless - that &apos;s me .
that &apos;ll do for tonight , Mr. Roderick .
it &apos;s time for Miss Pamela to go to bed . she looks tired out .
you &apos;re an old tyrant , Lizzie Flynn .
but you &apos;re perfectly right .
put the lights out , Rick .
now let &apos;s see .
I think I turn it down ... and blow down the chimney .
haven &apos;t done that since I was a kid .
come now , Whiskey . good boy .
- Are you having him in your room ?
- He &apos;s used to it , the creature .
get along up , now .
haven &apos;t I carried you enough this day ?
- Get on up , now .
- I &apos;ll give him a start .
what in the name of all the saints ?
well , he &apos;s not used to traveling and strange houses .
he &apos;ll find me if he wants me .
I &apos;ve not slept with the sound of the sea since I left Ireland .
would you like to go back there ?
- I &apos;d sooner see meself dead .
- Ah , go on with yez .
why , whatever ails these candles ?
it seems to be a rather drafty staircase .
Rick , I &apos;ve had a swim every day from our own beach ... and I &apos;ve started to make a garden .
you learn the oddest things when you garden .
did you know there &apos;s an upside-down to seeds ?
- No . good night , Pam .
- Good night , Rick .
- Good night , Master Rick .
- Good night , Liz .
come in .
I thought you were asleep .
it turns cold in the night here sometimes .
Oh , thanks .
Rick , there &apos;s something I want to talk to you about .
do you have any nice cast iron I can swap for this mattress ?
- We &apos;ll give you another tomorrow .
- Nothing will keep me awake tonight .
what price our house , Pam ?
pretty good , hmm ?
- You &apos;re really pleased with it ?
- I was never so happy in my life .
Oh , you started to say something . what ?
it was just that I was the one that got you to buy the house -
and I didn &apos;t appear very appreciative . is that it ?
it &apos;ll wait until tomorrow .
bless you , Rick . sleep well .
you too .
these are pretty good apples .
that concludes our broadcast for today .
good night , everyone . good night .
Pam , is that you ?
- Rick .
- Pamela .
- We don &apos;t want to wake Lizzie .
- But isn &apos;t it Lizzie ?
no , it isn &apos;t Lizzie .
it &apos;s coming from downstairs .
it comes from everywhere and nowhere .
take hold of yourself , Pam . I &apos;m going down and search the place .
Rick , I &apos;ve searched .
there &apos;s never anything there .
&quot; never &quot; ?
you mean you &apos;ve heard it before ?
Yes .
Rick , it &apos;s true , isn &apos;t it ? the sound , I mean .
you &apos;re hearing it too ?
- Of course I &apos;m hearing it .
- I wasn &apos;t sure .
- Pam -
- I thought I might be going crazy .
- Was that why you didn &apos;t tell me ?
- Yes , that , and -
Rick , it &apos;s your home . it &apos;s all we &apos;ve got to live in .
it sounds so heartbroken .
now don &apos;t get rattled , Pam .
- There &apos;s a logical explanation for this .
- Such as ?
you can &apos;t expect me to give it to you offhand , but it stands to reason .
- Does it come every night ?
- No .
just when you begin to think you dreamt it , it comes again .
be calm , Pam . be calm .
I &apos;m all right .
it &apos;ll stop soon now .
how do you know ?
it dies away at dawn .
listen .
that &apos;s the dawn breeze .
- Well , that &apos;s all for tonight .
- It &apos;s a pity , really .
hardly gives one time to look into it . now listen , dear -
look , let &apos;s talk tomorrow .
I &apos;ll die if I don &apos;t get some sleep .
Pam , leave your door open in case you &apos;re nervous .
all right , Rick .
and remember , you haven &apos;t a thing to worry about .
this business can be scientifically explained .
probably a loose wire hidden around the house , acting as an aerial ... picking up the sound of some woman in the village crying .
was she crying when the last tenants were frightened out ?
well , maybe she had a sad life .
anyway- ...
I &apos;m here now , and I &apos;m not the least rattled .
not the least little bit in the world .
it &apos;s just silly to be upset .
last night I heard it myself , Commander Beech - a perfectly appalling sound of crying .
Mr. Fitzgerald , Windward House belongs to you now .
- Why do you bring this matter to me ?
- Because we want information -
I for practical reasons , and my sister because she believes it &apos;s a ghost .
- She &apos;d like to know what the ghost wants .
- What utter bosh !
bosh , I agree , but when did the noises start ?
- You inherited the house , I believe .
- From my grandmother .
and there were no disturbances there in her time ?
none . and if there are noises now , they &apos;re from perfectly natural causes .
an echo from a subterranean cave , perhaps .
that would &apos;ve been heard in your grandmother &apos;s day .
Erosion may have changed the structure of the cliffs .
- It &apos;s not &apos; a bad suggest / on .
- May I come in , Grandfather ?
no , you run along to church . I &apos;ll join you in a few minutes .
- But I want to see Mr. Fitzgerald .
- I &apos;m glad you &apos;re better .
&quot; Bette r &quot; ?
but I haven &apos;t been ill .
Stella merely suffers with a general delicacy .
- She doesn &apos;t accept invitations .
- Never ?
perhaps I &apos;d better frankly state she &apos;s not strong enough to make new friends .
- Grandfather !
- Run along , my dear .
we &apos;re discussing something privately .
is there anything else , Mr. Fitzgerald ?
just one more question . was Stella &apos;s mother ever troubled at Windward House ?
- What do you mean ?
- Did she hear the crying ?
my daughter was not one to circulate ridiculous rumors .
if she &apos;d heard this , she &apos;d have mentioned it , and she never did ?
- Certainly not .
- Then the trouble must have begun since her death .
- Do you mean to imply -
- No , I &apos;m merely trying to set the date .
- I didn &apos;t mean that your daughter haunts -
- How dare you suggest such a thing ?
really , I &apos;m most desperately sorry . please forgive me .
very well . I accept your apology . but please understand one thing .
your purchase of the property doesn &apos;t establish a social bond between us .
what &apos;s the matter with us ?
why don &apos;t you allow Stella to see us ?
because I don &apos;t want to .
- And I must ask for your word not to send her any more invitations .
- I &apos;ll give you no such undertaking .
very well . I shall know how to deal with the matter .
Stella is not going inside that house !
great Scott !
you believe the place is haunted .
I hoped you &apos;d come along . I wanted to talk to you .
- Quick , drive around the next corner .
- Get in .
you had four freckles on the boat . they &apos;ve gone .
I couldn &apos;t go to see your sister . grandfather &apos;s been ill .
turn here .
now , what is this about your not seeing Pamela ?
at the mention of me coming to Windward , Grandfather almost had an attack .
- You feel your mother never would have left him ?
- No , never .
yet she did when she married , and he seemed to survive very nicely .
- He was younger then .
- Oh , so you &apos;re going to turn into one of these dim little ladies ... who fill hot-water bottles for elderly relatives .
- Good-bye , Stella Meredith .
- I &apos;m not now .
you &apos;re here now .
that &apos;s practically the nicest sentence that ever was spoken .
- Would you and your sister be in if I came to Windward tonight ?
- Yes .
supper &apos;s at 8 : 00 , but please come as early as you can .
Bob down . he &apos;s passing the end of the lane .
he &apos;s gone .
how will I ever get to church ?
sit on the floor , and I &apos;ll drive you past him .
drive to the side gate , please .
Yes .
- Like a lift , Commander ?
- No , thank you .
Oh ! what a moment !
- Were you scared ?
- Yes , but it was wonderful .
well , good-bye . say a little prayer for me .
golly !
how am I ever going to feel meek enough for church ?
Oh , Stella .
here &apos;s your prayer book and purse .
- Good-bye .
- Good-bye .
♪ Are like an evening gone ♪
♪ Short as the watch ♪
♪ That ends the night N&apos;
thank you , Mrs. Carlton , Colonel .
- Until next Sunday .
- Yes .
- Good-bye .
- Good-bye .
you seem very silent , Stella .
what have you against the Fitzgeralds , Grandfather ?
well , they &apos;re hardly our sort .
I &apos;ve decided to make friends with them .
you &apos;ll do no such thing .
why do you say that , Grandfather ?
I do not consider it suitable for you to visit Windward House .
- Not suitable ?
- I can &apos;t discuss the matter .
- That &apos;s all the reason I &apos;m going to get ?
- It will have to suffice , yes .
no , Grandfather .
I &apos;m 20 , and I &apos;m - and it &apos;s time I stopped living somebody else &apos;s life .
- I shall go to Windward whenever I please .
- Did you hear what I said ?
it isn &apos;t any good , Grandfather . I &apos;m on strike .
Stella , go to your room .
no use trying to lock me in . there isn &apos;t any key .
now don &apos;t be impertinent .
- Hello , Annie .
- Dinner will be late , miss .
I &apos;m having ever such trouble with the lamb .
you &apos;d better tell the commander .
Yes , it &apos;s very urgent . will you try to hurry the call ?
thank you .
I &apos;m telephoning . close that door .
it &apos;s just that dinner will be late , sir . it &apos;s the lamb being awkward .
I won &apos;t be here for dinner . and take some to Stella on a tray .
- And close that door !
may I speak to Miss Holloway ?
it &apos;s a trunk call , Miss Holloway . a Commander Beech .
thank you .
Yes , Commander Beech ?
I want to consult you about Stella , Miss Holloway .
it &apos;s a matter of the utmost urgency .
I can be with you late this afternoon .
I can &apos;t see you till this evening ... but I shall be glad to put you up for the night .
isn &apos;t it a little late to consult me about Stella ?
Yes , I know that , but I beg you to help me now .
you &apos;re the only human being in the world to whom I can turn .
the only person who wouldn &apos;t think me demented ... because I believe a house can be filled with malignity - malignity directed against a certain child .
the dining room isn &apos;t finished yet .
how glad this house must be to be lived in again .
I must dash back to Lizzie .
we &apos;re fighting ... over how much sherry you put in a tipsy pudding .
she wants to make it dead drunk .
- Do you like tipsy pudding ?
- I think I like everything to eat .
show her the rest of the house before it &apos;s dark .
- You &apos;ve really never been here since you were three ?
- Not inside .
but I walked here once when I was ten and peered in at the windows .
there was a stupendous row ... and the next week I got packed off to a school in Brussels .
- Did your grandfather give you reasons ?
- &quot; Reasons &quot; ?
if I &apos;d ever been reasoned with , I might have been a better child .
my old nursery &apos;s through there , isn &apos;t it ?
I should think so . it had nursery wallpaper .
how pretty your sister &apos;s made it !
what is it ?
something I &apos;d forgotten .
when I was little ...
I used to have a dream about this room .
you did ?
I &apos;d be lying here , and it &apos;d be dark ... and cold and frightening .
and then ...
a little flame would come - just a tiny point of light so big - and yet suddenly everything would be ... warm and light and peaceful .
and then ... someone would come and put the flame out , and I &apos;d be terrified .
perhaps your mother used to bring you a night light .
but who &apos;d take it out ?
may I see the studio before it &apos;s dark ?
it &apos;s rather messy in here . I was thinking of skipping this .
this is where my father painted my mother &apos;s picture .
strange to think of them here .
my father would have his easel to the light , wouldn &apos;t he ?
and perhaps my mother would sit there in her soft , white dress .
- But sometimes , of course , he &apos;d paint the other one .
- &quot; The other one &quot; ?
he had a model , you know . a foreign girl .
I &apos;ve never been able to find out much about her .
people get awfully hush-hush when I ask them .
between you and me and the grand piano ...
I suspect Father was a bit of a bad hat .
- Artistic temperament ?
- Very artistic , I &apos;m afraid .
but sometimes , you know , it &apos;s quite a comfort to me .
- If Father had been as good as Mother ... think how good I &apos;d have been .
it &apos;s getting almost too dark to see you properly .
won &apos;t you play something ?
it &apos;s about time you asked me that .
Oh , please go on .
just a second .
- You made that up ?
- Yes .
- But you must be brilliant !
- Oh , dazzling .
people have to wear sunglasses .
what &apos;s it called ?
it &apos;s a serenade .
&quot; to Stella by Starlight . &quot;
- You mean , this Stella ? - Mm-hmm .
but it &apos;s the most exciting thing that &apos;s ever happened to me !
is it ?
please go on .
you see , this is the only way I can paint you .
some black keys and some white ... and fingers that are much too clumsy ... but you &apos;re in it somehow .
it &apos;s gone awfully sad . why have you changed it ?
it just came out that way .
what &apos;s the matter ?
what is it , Stella ?
you &apos;re trembling .
I was wicked . how could I ever have laughed in her house ?
but it &apos;s my house now , Pam &apos;s and mine .
but she was so young , and she died so cruelly .
Stella !
Stella !
- Rick , what is it ?
- I don &apos;t know . it &apos;s that blasted room !
Stella , stop !
Stella !
for heaven &apos;s sake , Stella !
- What &apos;s the matter , Rick ?
- You were going over the edge .
- Was I ?
- If I hadn &apos;t caught you .
I hadn &apos;t any sense of danger at all .
look .
I think this is where my mother fell . by the dead tree .
are you all right ?
quite , thanks , except dying of hunger .
then you must come and get some food .
do you know this is our very first party in this house ?
- Is it ?
- Shall we sing her the song ?
- His introduction to music . - ♪ La ♪
♪ Wee chickabirdie , tra la la laid an egg on the vundysull ♪
♪ The vundysull began to crack Wee chickabirdie , la , la , la ♪
♪ Wee chickabirdie - N&apos;
stay here .
Lizzie , where are you ?
what &apos;s the matter ?
Mr. Roderick !
Mr. Roderick !
what is it , Lizzie ?
are you hurt ?
the studio door - there &apos;s something there .
look , Lizzie , there &apos;s nothing there .
there was !
I saw it with me own two eyes !
what ?
it was like a mist - a crawling mist .
you imagined it just because you heard the house was haunted .
I &apos;d heard nothing of the sort , Mr. Roderick .
holy saints !
are you tellin &apos; me it is ?
for heaven &apos;s sake , Rick , what is it ?
Oh , Lizzie &apos;s dreamed up a ghost for herself .
come along , Lizzie .
darling Lizzie .
I &apos;d just come upstairs to turn down the beds .
there it stood by the studio door , looking down at me .
- A woman , it was .
- Four steps back , it was just a mist .
&apos;Twas a woman . I swear it .
the ghost of a woman !
come and sit down . you &apos;ll be all right in a minute .
have some sherry , Lizzie .
just a drop .
I &apos;ll not sleep in this house another night , Mr. Roderick .
- Come now , Lizzie .
- I will not !
I &apos;d sooner die .
she can go to the Jessup farm .
what &apos;s happened to Stella ?
she was with me when I came in .
Stella ?
Stella , where are you ?
Stella , are you in the house ?
Stella !
Pamela !
Pamela !
Stella , darling .
Yes , Rick &apos; ?
what &apos;s happened ?
- Rick , what is it ?
- She &apos;s in a dead faint .
- This room - it &apos;s like an icebox .
- Colder .
we &apos;ll have to get a doctor .
there &apos;s one at the first house in the village .
that &apos;s the girl .
well , what kind of bogey did you see ?
I didn &apos;t see anything .
fainted out of sheer cussedness , huh ?
I can only remember the cold coming .
Hello , Stella .
- Hello .
- You suddenly felt cold ?
it wasn &apos;t just that .
the room went cold , and I was frightened .
well , you just forget about it for a bit .
Miss Fitzgerald &apos;s got some soup for you .
see if you can get her to take some .
she &apos;ll do all right , but it &apos;s quite a nasty case of shock .
- That &apos;s all ?
you &apos;re quite sure ?
- Sit down .
- You see , I brought her here . - Mm-hmm .
take that neat .
can , uh - Can she stay the night here ?
Oh , yes . but suppose that spook starts howling ?
Oh , your spook .
it &apos;s just an echo from a cave probably , but it sounds like a spook .
I &apos;d rather risk it than move her tonight .
there was some rather queer business earlier this evening .
the cliff is so close , and she walked right to the edge . if I hadn &apos;t caught her -
we &apos;ll keep a close watch . did she take her soup ?
eight spoonfuls and then drifted off to sleep .
splendid . she &apos;ll sleep for hours now .
- We &apos;ll keep on watch here .
- You &apos;d better go to bed , Miss Fitzgerald .
- You &apos;re looking all in .
- I &apos;d rather watch with you .
- Would you like some coffee ?
- Thanks .
Pam , who do you think &apos;s moved in with Dr. Scott ?
- Our Bobby .
- No !
I found the poor dog in the street . he was in a pitiable state of nerves .
- How is he now ?
- Fine .
- Bobby was the first to see the ghost .
- See ?
Pamela believes it .
Rick , stop hiding your head in the sand .
you heard the sounds last night .
Lizzie &apos;s been half frightened out of her wits ... and Stella &apos;s been in deadly danger twice .
everyone in the village knows the house is strange .
I expected support from you .
you must tell us everything you know about the place after I &apos;ve made the coffee .
unfortunately I &apos;m a newcomer to Biddlecombe .
I &apos;ve only lived here 12 years .
it &apos;s not ancient history to us . please go on .
the model &apos;s name was Carmel .
she was a Spanish gypsy , and a thorough bad lot .
so was Meredith , from what I can gather .
- Didn &apos;t Mrs. Meredith suspect ?
- She must have . the thing was an open scandal .
the girl and he &apos;d have been stoned out of the village if not for Mary Meredith .
she was very much admired .
I suppose she just accepted the situation .
and she &apos;s still sobbing her heart out about it .
- Where &apos;s Carmel now ?
- Dead .
she died in this very house ... a week after Mary fell from the cliff trying to save her from suicide . ironic , wasn &apos;t it ?
is it known why the girl tried to kill herself ?
Meredith &apos;s said to have tired of her .
think of it - those two women struggling on the cliff .
I wonder if Mary &apos;s death could have been murder .
it &apos;s been hinted at .
the whole story was dug up and embroidered when Stella &apos;s father died .
- When was that ?
- Three years ago , abroad .
he never came back to Windward .
all of them dead with their secrets .
one of them &apos;s not quite dead enough for me .
don &apos;t say that about the poor soul .
if a spirit comes back , it &apos;s for some particular purpose .
- That &apos;s my sister &apos;s special crotchet .
- We &apos;ve got to find out what it is .
I wish I knew some more , but I &apos;m afraid I don &apos;t .
- What time &apos;s your wailing lady due ?
- About dawn .
we ought to know each other pretty well by then .
Twenty-one hand . I &apos;m out .
- Is it my deal ?
- It was , two hours ago .
5 : 30 .
Yes , Moaning Martha seems to have missed her cue .
Rick , have you brought some more flowers in ?
no . why ?
don &apos;t you notice the scent ?
it &apos;s overpowering .
extraordinary .
Heliotrope , isn &apos;t it ?
no .
no , it &apos;s mimosa .
there &apos;s a light !
where did that come from ?
it &apos;s like a night-light .
she &apos;s gone !
Rick , the window !
- What is it ?
- Where are you , Stella ?
don &apos;t be afraid , Stella .
- &quot; Afraid &quot; ?
- Well , we were , a little .
I wanted to see the dawn with her .
&quot; her &quot; ?
don &apos;t you know who it is in your house ?
- It &apos;s my mother .
- You saw her ?
I didn &apos;t see her ... but when I woke , she was here in the room .
it was full of her scent .
I could feel her presence everywhere .
and there was something else ... something I &apos;ve never known in my whole life .
what ?
the knowledge that ... someone loved me very dearly .
come on , young Stella . I &apos;ll take you home .
but I don &apos;t want to go .
sorry , but I &apos;ve got to get some sleep , you know .
- But I can come back ?
- No .
what do you mean ?
you couldn &apos;t want to keep me away from her .
Stella , remember how ill you were last night ?
but that was nothing to do with her .
I think I was just frightened after what Lizzie said .
I tell you , my mother would never hurt me .
I shan &apos;t be afraid again . please .
I &apos;m sorry .
it &apos;s just that my knees are wobbly .
come along . Dr. Scott will drive you home .
I wonder what I &apos;ve done to her , bringing her here .
don &apos;t blame yourself .
but that look in her eyes , that terrible happiness .
Oh .
wait a minute . perhaps she &apos;s nearer right than we are .
- She &apos;s what ?
- Perhaps she &apos;s right in being happy .
supposing Mary Meredith &apos;s spirit had been searching for Stella ... and now that it &apos;s found her , it &apos;s found peace .
suppose we haven &apos;t a ghost anymore .
- Where are you going ?
- To the studio .
how has it always shown itself in the past ?
sobbing sounds downstairs , and cold and depression in the studio .
there wasn &apos;t any sobbing tonight , only warmth and fragrance .
- But why the studio ?
- I &apos;ll know in there .
I &apos;ll know whether it &apos;s a decent , human room . won &apos;t you ?
it may not be quite so cold , really .
Oh , stop it , Pam . it &apos;s clammy and rotten .
whatever it is , it &apos;s in here with us .
let &apos;s get out .
Mary Meredith , please .
please . we &apos;re sorry you had to suffer .
isn &apos;t that enough ?
what more do you want ?
you were right about one thing , Pam :
we haven &apos;t a ghost anymore . we &apos;ve got two of them .
- Is Commander Beech at home ?
- He won &apos;t be back until this evening , sir .
- It &apos;s Miss Stella I really want to see .
- Won &apos;t you come in ? I &apos;ll tell her .
thank you .
Miss Stella &apos;s in her room , sir . I &apos;ll -
- Rick .
- Stella .
- I knew you couldn &apos;t mean it .
- Mean what ?
haven &apos;t you come to take me to Windward ?
no , Stella .
you mustn &apos;t go there again , ever .
listen , darling ...
I &apos;ve thought this thing out , and you must go away from here .
- Go away ?
- Yes , forever .
you wouldn &apos;t care ?
not in the least , because I &apos;ll be coming with you .
it won &apos;t be luxury - just the smallest London flat - but it &apos;ll be ours .
and no unseen , uninvited guests .
- And Windward ?
- We &apos;ll tear it down and forget it .
and my mother ?
but Stella , you &apos;re talking of a dream and a memory .
I &apos;m talking about my mother . she &apos;s been waiting for me .
in some queer sort of way , I always knew it .
what about me ?
I was under the impression you cared for me .
this hasn &apos;t anything to do with you .
you talk about destroying that house . you &apos;d be tearing me apart .
stop it , Stella . do you care for me or don &apos;t you ?
I can &apos;t think about you , not while she &apos;s out there .
take me there .
but this is horrible , unhealthy stuff .
put it out of your mind .
turn your back on the past and run - run hard .
I &apos;ll go there somehow .
- You won &apos;t , I promise you .
- I hate you for that .
Stella .
you shan &apos;t make me forget her ! you shan &apos;t !
Oh !
that &apos;s enough , Bobby . that &apos;s enough .
you &apos;ll get lipstick poisoning .
he &apos;s got a passion for hard-boiled eggs . did you know ?
and turnip tops .
I don &apos;t think he has any idea he &apos;s a dog . not really .
of course , he thinks he has a rather odd figure for a man .
I didn &apos;t question him very closely about where he belonged .
I was afraid I might find out . I &apos;m sorry now .
- Sorry ? - Yes .
I should &apos;ve met you sooner .
are you there , Scott ?
in here .
- Did you see Ste / la ?
- Yes , I did .
you &apos;ve got to do something . she &apos;s on the edge of a collapse .
you &apos;re telling me ! this is hardly a case for a country doctor , you know .
- When does the commander get back ?
- Last train tonight .
- Heaven help young Stella then .
- Look here .
can &apos;t you convince her her mother wouldn &apos;t want her to go near that house ?
not I. She &apos;s been listening for a voice that &apos;s been still for 17 years .
I can give her a sedative .
why don &apos;t we try to get a message from Mary Meredith ?
- Do what ?
- We could hold a séance .
you &apos;re not serious ?
that &apos;s how the dead are supposed to communicate with the living .
- &#91; Rick &#91; According to the idiot fringe .
- You have no right to say that .
many intelligent people believe in spiritualism .
- Have you ever been to a séance ?
- I have .
Shaded lights , the alphabet laid out on the table , an upside-down wine glass ... messages from somebody &apos;s Uncle Oswald , how to find a mislaid toothbrush .
stop scoffing , Rick . not all séances are faked .
all right , we &apos;ll have a séance .
it shouldn &apos;t be difficult to move a glass around and say it &apos;s Mary Meredith .
- What do you think ?
- Leave me out of this .
- I won &apos;t let you cheat Stella .
- What do you expect Mary Meredith to tell her ?
&quot; entrust your life to a tall , dark man , excruciatingly handsome &quot; ?
Crikey , no ! I want to set Stella &apos;s mind at rest . she &apos;s just about torn in two .
unless the conflict inside her is stopped ... it may even affect her reason .
here &apos;s a message that might do it :
&quot; Stella , this is your mother . since I &apos;ve found you , I &apos;ve found peace .
stay away from Windward House . &quot;
- Stella would have to be at the séance .
- Naturally .
it &apos;ll have to be at Windward , and it &apos;s dangerous for her .
- We &apos;d be with her all the time .
- All right . it may be worth a try .
the important thing is that we should all believe .
- Isn &apos;t it , Dr. Scott ?
- So I understand . what now ?
everybody puts a finger on the glass .
perhaps you should ask some questions , Stella .
is anybody here ?
are you my mother ?
you don &apos;t want me to stay away from Windward , do you , Mother ?
Oh , I knew it , Mother . and I want to be near you too .
is that why you stay here - just to be near me ?
but you &apos;re holding it , Rick .
and you , Dr. Scott . holding it hard .
take your fingers off .
is that your reason , darling ?
just to be near me &apos; ?
but what else ?
I ...
G ...
u , A-
&quot; I guard . &quot;
you mean , you guard me from some danger ?
but what ?
c ...
a ...
R , M-
&quot; Carmel . &quot;
- That &apos;s enough .
- It is indeed .
let &apos;s go into the other room .
- Stella , what is it ?
- Are you ill , Stella ?
quiet . leave her alone .
Oigan . ¡ Oigan !
- Stop her , Scott !
- Shh . she &apos;s in a trance .
I saw this happen once before at a séance . I thought it was a fake .
- But this isn &apos;t .
- I know. it &apos;s dangerous .
- May I ask her some questions ?
- No !
it may be best to try and reach her mind .
now keep your voice quiet and reassuring .
are you Mary Meredith , Stella &apos;s mother ?
Ella no e &apos; . ¡ Ella no e &apos; !
¡ No le crean na &apos; !
¡ No le pongan oido que está mintiendo !
don &apos;t ask her any more !
that &apos;s the doorbell .
shall I answer it ?
Lizzie &apos;s at the Jessups &apos; .
no . don &apos;t move until she &apos;s over the worst of this .
¡ So &apos; ladrona ! ¡ Ladrona de mi carino !
- Spanish , isn &apos;t it , Scott ?
- I don &apos;t know .
Rick , the mimosa scent !
the room &apos;s full of it !
Mary Meredith &apos;s in here too .
the cold .
it &apos;s never been cold in here .
the candles ! look at the candles !
- I &apos;d better answer it &apos; .
- All right .
stop , Pamela !
don &apos;t go near that door .
it &apos;s coming toward us !
what in thunder is this ?
Stella dear , it &apos;s all right now .
we must get her out .
what have you been doing to the child ?
- What &apos;s the meaning of this , Dr. Scott ?
- I can &apos;t explain now .
- This is incredible behavior !
- Quietly , Stella .
- There &apos;s nothing to be frightened of .
- Control yourself , child !
- Don &apos;t speak to her like that !
- You &apos;re responsible for this - you and your meddling .
and so are you . why didn &apos;t you tell us the truth ?
- I warned you .
- Only of idle gossip .
perhaps you &apos;d like your money back . you shall have it , the entire purchase price .
no , thank you , Commander . I know this now :
Stella will never be well until this house is cured . somehow we &apos;re going to cure it .
Dr. Scott , have the goodness to drive us home .
there . now you &apos;ll sleep all right .
I &apos;ll be here early in the morning .
Stella is no longer your patient . nor am I .
- But someone must look after her .
- That is not your concern , Dr. Scott .
- I shall be at your disposal at any hour .
- Thank you .
everything will be all right .
won &apos;t you come in , Miss Holloway ?
- Is she asleep ?
- Not yet .
Hello , Stella .
Miss Holloway .
go to sleep , Stella .
Dr. Scott tells me she went into a trance tonight .
spoke some words they thought were Spanish .
how did she happen to be at Windward ?
the people who bought the place are searching into its past .
- Are they indeed ?
- Can you make the child well again ?
I hope so .
it won &apos;t be a short process . she &apos;s far more ill than you imagine .
she won &apos;t want to go with you . she &apos;s never outgrown her fear of you .
I could &apos;ve cured it years ago if you &apos;d let me have her ... as Mary would have wished me to .
her place was in Mary &apos;s home . I &apos;ve taught her to be like Mary in every way .
- How can you say such a thing ?
- She &apos;s not so beautiful , of course .
Mary was a goddess .
her skin was radiant , and that bright , bright hair .
how this room brings her back to me .
the nights we sat talking in front of that fireplace ... planning our whole lives .
it wasn &apos;t flirtations and dresses we talked about .
we were no silly , giggling girls .
we intended to conquer life .
you at least did .
will you try to take Mary &apos;s place with her now ?
I &apos;ll do my best .
she &apos;s asleep .
if you &apos;ll call my chauffeur , he &apos;ll carry her downstairs .
it will be better for her to wake at my place .
I &apos;m deeply grateful to you .
so they &apos;re searching into the past .
they shan &apos;t ever find out , my darling .
I promise you .
Elizabeth Flynn , where are yez ?
I &apos;m here , Mr. Roderick .
and will you please come here at once ?
don &apos;t we get any breakfast ?
what &apos;s the matter ?
Oh , that . that happened last night .
I am not talking about that .
- I &apos;m talking about this .
- The anagram letters . Yes , yes .
Anagrams , is it ?
don &apos;t you try to bluff me , Mr. Roderick .
&apos;Tis a heathen device to call devils out of hell .
stop looking at me as though you were gonna take away my bicycle .
I will not stay in a house where it goes on , and that is an &quot; ultimate &quot; !
come now , Lizzie . from now on we &apos;re through with all this rubbish .
- We &apos;re going after facts .
- What facts ?
the facts about this blasted haunting .
Rick , why burden Lizzie with this ?
Whisht now , Miss Pam . where will we start , Mr. Rick ?
I don &apos;t know . everybody seems to be dead .
- The trained nurse isn &apos;t .
- What trained nurse ?
she was here when it happened - the friend of the lady that went over the cliff .
where did you hear all this ?
what do you suppose we talk of at the Jessups &apos; ?
it was the trained nurse that shouted down to Mr. Jessup on the shore .
- Was Jessup in on the tragedy ?
- He was after some lost sheep .
the tide was out , so he went down .
and as he passed under the dead tree , he heard a scream .
- Mrs. Meredith ?
- No .
&apos;Twas the scream of a terrified child .
as he ran towards it , the poor lady came crashing down .
&apos;Twas then that the nurse called .
Lizzie Flynn , you &apos;re a gold mine .
if we could only get the name of this nurse .
Ah , that &apos;s easy . wait , now .
- Mr. Jessup ?
- Yes , Mrs. Flynn .
what was the name of Mrs. Meredith &apos;s trained nurse ... the one that got so famous and grand ?
- Miss Holloway .
- Aye .
Miss Holloway .
she has a big , fine place of her own now - a hospital , like .
&apos;Tis on Bodmin Moor .
she calls it ... the Mary Meredith Retreat .
- Mr. and Miss Fitzgerald ?
- Yes .
- Won &apos;t you come in ?
- Thank you .
wait in there , please , and I will announce you to Miss Holloway .
the place is quite stunning , isn &apos;t it ?
why are you whispering ?
why are you ?
Ooh !
a gentleman !
- How very unusual .
- Good afternoon .
Oh , dear me . Yes . good afternoon .
good afternoon .
are you by any chance waiting to see Miss Holloway ?
Yes , we have an appointment .
what lucky people !
and what luck for me too , because I &apos;m sure you won &apos;t mind -
- But perhaps you will .
- Is there something we can do ?
Oh , if you &apos;d be so very kind .
you see ... this isn &apos;t my day for an interview ... and I want her to have these .
what are they , bird &apos;s eggs ?
Oh !
but that &apos;s very funny ... because , you see , I &apos;m Miss Bird .
they &apos;re just little stones ... because she likes simple things ... and she has so many flowers .
there isn &apos;t much else one can find .
well , I &apos;ll give them to her .
thank you .
and now , I ... think I &apos;ll just go out for a little walk .
go back to your work at once , Miss Bird .
don &apos;t forget .
will you come this way , please ?
- Shall I take them ?
- No , I &apos;ll deliver them .
as you wish .
come in .
- How do you do ?
- How do you do ?
this is so kind of you .
I was asked to give you these by a Miss Bird , I believe .
poor Miss Bird . our saddest case .
they &apos;re really very fine stones , aren &apos;t they ?
I must remember to thank her for them .
she comes to me once a week for a little chat .
- Won &apos;t you sit down ?
- Thank you .
forgive our ignorance . we know so very little of your work .
is it with mental patients ?
not patients , Miss Fitzgerald . just guests .
in a way this is like a hotel ... where there are beautiful things to look at , music to hear ... and a little sympathy .
but don &apos;t let &apos;s talk about me .
you told me on the telephone about disturbances at Windward .
how can I help you ?
we thought perhaps you could tell us what Mary and Carmel were really like .
they were extraordinary women , both of them .
Mary Meredith was the finest human being I ever knew .
- Is that she ?
- Yes .
and Carmel ?
Oh , she was exceptional too .
I never saw such intensity of evil .
she was a Spanish gypsy - crafty , cruel .
- I &apos;m sorry .
- Why did Mrs. Meredith put up with it ?
she thought Meredith should be the one to end the affair .
- And did he ?
- Yes , in time .
she and Meredith took the girl to Paris ... found a position for her , left her well supplied with money .
then they came back here with their baby .
for a time it seemed as if there were some possibility of happiness .
- And then ?
- Carmel came back .
she still wanted Mary &apos;s husband .
you know how it ended .
a neighbor of ours spoke of something we can &apos;t quite understand .
- He mentions a child crying on the cliff that night .
- A terrified child .
Oh .
that &apos;s a part of the story so ugly , I &apos;ve never mentioned it before .
we &apos;re sorry to distress you .
that night , the girl Carmel had been told she must leave Windward .
if she could &apos;ve killed both Mary and her husband , she &apos;d have done so .
a better plan flashed into her wicked little brain .
she went into the nursery , picked up their baby , and raced to the cliff .
- Good heavens / Mary was after her in a second ...
Meredith and I close behind .
Carmel reached the cliff by the dead tree .
for a moment I saw them struggling ... then Carmel raised her arm and struck Mary down .
then it was murder ?
the will to kill had always been there , I think .
directed against Stella . can that be what survives ?
- Maybe that accounts for Stella &apos;s queer business on the cliff .
- What was that &apos; ?
something in that house drove her out toward the edge ... and if I hadn &apos;t caught her , she &apos;d have gone over .
would she indeed ?
how very curious .
please , finish your story .
it was finished .
everything was finished .
Meredith went down the cliff .
Mary was dead when he reached her .
- And Carmel ?
- She ran out into the storm .
next morning , she crawled back in the early stages of pneumonia .
I fought for Carmel &apos;s life day and night ... hating her all the time !
how awful for you .
I &apos;m sorry , I - I discipline others .
I - I can &apos;t discipline myself .
there .
have I told you everything you want to know ?
all except one thing .
that last night , who told Carmel she must go ?
why , Mary - I should say Meredith .
it &apos;s the one decent thing I ever knew him to do .
this - This is all extremely -
I &apos;m sorry .
may I offer you tea ?
thank you , but we must get back before our maid leaves .
she won &apos;t stay at Windward after dark .
I &apos;m afraid I haven &apos;t been much help with your problem .
well , thank you anyway , and good-bye .
- Good-bye .
- Good-bye .
good afternoon , my dear .
did you want to see me ?
I &apos;ve been asking for you all day .
I &apos;m being treated as though I were insane .
has anyone used that word ?
- I &apos;ve told them a thousand times -
- It isn &apos;t a question of a word .
my door &apos;s kept locked , and there &apos;s a queer look in their eyes .
Oh . you feel persecuted .
no .
about the cliff at Windward , Stella- what did you feel as you ran toward it ?
I didn &apos;t feel anything .
I was sad in the house .
was it as though some will were directing you ... a will stronger than yours ?
the sea sounded loud and beautiful .
I just went in that direction .
in fact , you don &apos;t quite know .
- I want to see my grandfather .
- You will in time .
does Grandfather know what this place is like ?
that woman who laughs -
I hear laughing all night ! and that other woman that -
your grandfather &apos;s sorry that you have to be here ... but he knows you &apos;ll be better soon .
&quot; better &quot; ?
but I &apos;m perfectly all right !
I wouldn &apos;t say that , Stella dear .
and please don &apos;t keep asking to see me .
why do you hate me , Miss Holloway ?
you see ?
you do feel persecuted .
Rick , if I should ever happen to lose my mind -
I don &apos;t think you &apos;ll lose it . it might rattle to one side .
but if I do , no Mary Meredith Retreat for me .
plain , old-fashioned lunatic asylum ... not that creepy horror .
you &apos;ll have a lovely talk with Miss Holloway once a week .
- You think she was lying to us ?
- About the past ?
why should she ?
she wasn &apos;t gonna tell us about the baby , and later she made that one break .
Admitting it was Mary who told Carmel to go .
why try to hide it ?
it was a normal human reaction .
made me like Mary better , as a matter of fact .
I was getting awfully bored with her perfection .
why should Miss Holloway want to turn her into a plaster saint ?
maybe she likes plaster saints .
she &apos;s one herself .
thank you , Doctor .
I assure you that when that healthy young man laughs , he isn &apos;t being delirious .
Good-bye , Doctor .
- Hello . come in .
- Hello .
- What news of Stella ?
- None , and I won &apos;t be having any .
her grandfather &apos;s kicked me out . where have you been all day ?
- To Bodmin Moor and back .
- Seeing a Miss Holloway .
what , Holy Holloway of &quot; wealth through harmony &quot; ?
- What do you know about her ?
- Nothing , except that ...
Dr. Rudd , my predecessor , had some sort of prejudice against her .
she says Carmel killed Mary Meredith .
Yes , she was there . nursed Carmel afterwards .
- Could we talk to Dr. Rudd about her ?
- Only if we have another séance .
- Oh .
- I wonder -
what ?
it &apos;s only the very faintest chance , of course , but come on upstairs .
1908 to &apos; 11 , &apos; 12 to &apos; 15 , &apos; 16 to &apos; 19 .
here we are .
- It happened in the winter .
- Yes , let &apos;s start with November .
from his handwriting , Dr. Rudd must have been 200 years old .
measles , measles , measles ... whooping cough , measles , appendicitis -
pleasant change for the old boy .
here we are . &quot; called to Windward House .
Meredith &apos;s model , Carmel Quesada - double pneumonia . &quot;
&quot; Quesada girl much worse . no attempt to warm the bedroom .
found traces of snow on the floor . &quot;
snow ?
then the window was left open .
&quot; spoke severely to nurse .
returned to Windward this evening . patient dead .
nurse Holloway threatened me with legal action ... when I used the words &apos; criminal negligence . &quot;
- But that means -
- To a doctor of Rudd &apos;s generation , it was apt to mean murder .
- Miss Holloway murdered Carmel .
- Doctor .
- In a quiet , ladylike way .
- Doctor !
Yes , Edith ?
the commander &apos;s maid &apos;s on the phone . you &apos;re to come at once .
- Is it Miss Meredith ?
- It &apos;s the commander .
took awful bad , the maid says .
all right , Edith . you take this home .
there may be some other details . I &apos;ll be along later .
he &apos;s in here , Doctor .
I undid his shoes . it was all I knew how to do .
- Bad one this time , Scott .
- Yes , I know .
hold that under his nose .
want an apology , Scott ?
you &apos;d get it , if you stuck out for it .
no , thanks . I &apos;ll have you right in a jiffy .
who &apos;s there ?
who do you suppose is there ?
Hello , Lizzie .
I &apos;m sitting in your mother &apos;s chair , and if any ghost comes along ...
I &apos;ll let out a scream that will frighten the life out of it .
why ?
what &apos;s happened ?
I feel all the wickedness of this house gathering around .
- Come on , now . hop off to the Jessups &apos; .
- I &apos;m not going .
I &apos;ll be found dead in me bed in the morning ... stiff with fright , and me death will be on you .
me ?
how do I know what devilment you &apos;ll be up to when me back is turned ?
I promise we &apos;ll do nothing tonight that the priest wouldn &apos;t approve of .
Lord bless you , Mr. Rick . I was hoping you &apos;d say that .
I &apos;ll go and get me hat and coat .
- Find anything new ?
- Nothing after that entry .
- How about a whiskey and soda ?
- Less soda than usual , thanks .
awful if we took to drink , both of us .
but it &apos;s an ideal house for delirium tremens .
before you take a sip ... don &apos;t you smell mimosa ?
Yes . are you scared ?
well , I wish I &apos;d wake up .
it came from the nursery last night .
you have the great nose of the family .
not a trace of it now .
- It &apos;s strongest here .
- It &apos;s almost overpowering .
I wish you &apos;d tell us what you want , Mary Meredith .
- Mr. Rick ?
- Yes ?
I forgot to ask - did you find out anything today ?
- Just turned up a couple of murders .
- Holy saints preserve us !
answer the door .
it &apos;s probably Dr. Scott .
- Good evening , Dr. Scott &apos; .
- Evening , Lizzie .
- In here .
- Good night , Miss Pam .
- Good night .
- Good night .
- I &apos;m glad to find you here .
- How &apos;s the commander ?
it &apos;s not him I &apos;m worried about . it &apos;s Stella .
- What &apos;s the matter with her ?
- She &apos;s at Miss Holloway &apos;s .
- No !
- We &apos;ve got to get her out - tonight .
that &apos;s the way I feel , but don &apos;t let &apos;s get hysterical .
after all , Miss Holloway was her mother &apos;s best friend .
the idea of her spending an hour in that place is horrible .
- Can you get the old boy &apos;s permission ?
- He &apos;s too ill . we &apos;ve no authority .
- Then we &apos;ll do it without .
- Shall we take the casebook ?
- Might be able to frighten her with it .
- Yes . no , wait .
we &apos;ll describe what we found and then pile it on , huh ?
let &apos;s get to a telephone .
Yes &apos; ?
Oh , it &apos;s no bother at all , Miss Fitzgerald .
I &apos;ll be glad to see you again .
are you motoring ?
in two hours .
Good-bye .
bring in Miss Meredith .
I may need the car this evening .
good evening , my dear .
come in .
sit down .
I thought you &apos;d feel more at home here .
I do , Miss Holloway .
I &apos;ve been giving your problem the most serious consideration .
it &apos;s not much of a problem . I just want to go home .
to your grandfather &apos;s ?
I couldn &apos;t permit that .
you &apos;ve never been very happy there .
where would you really like to be ?
you mean Windward ?
that &apos;s the basis of all your trouble - being kept away from there .
do you think she wants you there ?
Yes , I think she does .
and what she wants , I want .
I &apos;ve talked with the Fitzgeralds . they &apos;re very fond of you .
they &apos;ll let me stay there with them ?
for the present , your grandfather &apos;s not to know you &apos;ve left here .
it would worry him .
you must go straight to Windward .
is that clear ?
Miss Holloway , I &apos;m the happiest person in the world !
there &apos;s a train in 40 minutes .
my car will take you to the station .
good evening . won &apos;t you come in ?
- I must announce you !
- Don &apos;t bother . we &apos;ll announce ourselves .
good evening . so you &apos;ve thought of more questions ?
- Why didn &apos;t you tell us Stella was here ?
- The presence of my guests is confidential .
- We &apos;ve come to take her .
- This is Stella &apos;s doctor .
Oh , I begin to understand . this is a rescue party .
take me to Stella at once .
there was a time when I would have resented such impertinence ... particularly from a doctor whose conduct leaves so much to be desired .
please stop beating about the bush .
I couldn &apos;t be angry with anyone tonight .
you know , those moments when the light is very clear ... when the scales at last swing into perfect balance .
- Where is Stella ?
- Tell them , Miss Ellis .
she &apos;s on the train for Biddlecombe . the 9 : 20 .
on her way home .
- Is that true ?
- She &apos;ll be there long before you .
- What happened ?
- Nothing .
she wasn &apos;t very happy here . I can &apos;t be of any help to people who are unhappy .
- She went to her grandfather &apos;s ?
- No .
- Not to Windward House ?
- Better than that .
to the cliff , and the rocks below the cliff .
you let her ?
that &apos;s were Mary went . that &apos;s where she died .
she &apos;s out of her mind .
come on ! Stella has a 20-minute start !
the sea has such a lonely sauna &apos; .
- Every seventh wave -
- You &apos;d better look after her .
Miss Holloway ! what &apos;s the matter ?
get out of this room !
I &apos;ve done what she wanted at last .
haven &apos;t I , Mary ?
it &apos;s all straight now .
there are no frayed edges .
no loose ends .
all straight .
all smooth .
these local trains are very slow , you know .
but this one had a head start .
you needn &apos;t worry . she can &apos;t get into the house .
you did lock the door , didn &apos;t you , Pam ?
no , I thought you did .
- Will you be all right , miss ?
- Oh , yes .
I &apos;ll be all right now . I &apos;ll be with my friends .
Pamela ?
Rick ?
Pamela , are you there ?
Rick ?
where are you ?
please .
Lizzie ?
is that you ?
Stella .
Stella .
grandfather !
grandfather !
Stella , my child .
what &apos;s the matter ?
what are you doing here ?
someone telephoned ... from Miss Holloway &apos;s .
and you walked all that way ?
well , I had to get here .
don &apos;t try and talk , darling . I &apos;ll get Dr. Scott .
Oh , dear . there &apos;s no telephone in this house .
- Go . go !
- You can &apos;t be left alone .
but the danger is for you .
- Please get out of this house now .
- Now lie back quietly .
I &apos;m not afraid of anything here .
then be afraid .
be afraid , for heaven &apos;s sake .
when you were a little child ... after her death ... the evils of this house reached out for you .
I took you away then .
if I could only take you now .
it &apos;s all right . we &apos;re together .
Stella ! go !
- Go -
- Grandfather !
I won &apos;t be afraid , Mother .
Stella !
Stella !
Stella , stop !
hold on , darling .
we &apos;ve got you now , darling . hang on .
- Are you all right ?
- Yes .
sure ?
Dr. Scott , Grandfather &apos;s in the studio .
he &apos;s terribly ill .
we &apos;d better get to him at once .
there &apos;s nothing I can do , my dear .
I knew .
she killed him just as she tried to kill me .
- My own mother !
- No , Stella .
but I tell you , I saw my mother just as my father painted her .
- It must have been Carmel .
- It wasn &apos;t .
steady , Stella .
unless -
unless perhaps Miss Holloway was right .
perhaps it &apos;s my mind .
- Oh , Rick !
- No , darling .
the mimosa scent - it &apos;s flooding the room .
it &apos;s all right , darling . nothing will hurt you .
but I &apos;m not frightened . this is what I felt in the nursery that night .
the book !
what &apos;s doing it ?
- The wind .
- Bu ! what about the mimosa ?
we &apos;re letting our imaginations play hob with our senses .
&quot; 11 : 15 a.m. Mary Ann Hardy .
broken arm . second this year . &quot;
it &apos;s imagination , all right .
Oh , what did I expect ?
wait a minute .
&quot; 3 : 20 p.m. Called to Windward House ... to attend Meredith &apos;s model , who had fainted .
it didn &apos;t take much skill to find the reason .
girl in poor physical condition ... but I &apos;m sure her great happiness will carry her through . &quot;
then Carmel had a baby too !
&quot; 5 : 10 p.m. Mrs. Meredith came to see me .
expected tears , hysteria .
instead , icy control ... and a dominating desire that the girl &apos;s condition be kept secret .
I should ha ve more sympathy with the lady if I did not know how she herself . &apos; ..
has feared and refused motherhood . &quot;
what can it all mean ?
- Where were you born , Stella ?
- In Paris .
where they took Carmel before they came back with their baby .
but surely you don &apos;t think -
I think Mary adopted Carmel &apos;s child ... gave her a home on the condition that Carmel never came back .
only she couldn &apos;t live up to it . she had to be near her baby .
but it doesn &apos;t fit .
the mimosa scent ... that comes with the gentle ghost - that was Mary &apos;s scent .
- Stella &apos;s father told her .
- No .
no , my father only wrote that it was my mother &apos;s scent .
I &apos;m Carmel &apos;s child !
Oh , Stella , don &apos;t mind too much .
&quot; mind &quot; ?
can &apos;t you see what it &apos;s done for me ?
always there &apos;s been something fighting in me ... something that couldn &apos;t be calm and cold like Mary .
I can be myself now .
that &apos;s what she &apos;s waited all these years to tell you .
Oh , Mother , now I know .
she &apos;s happy now .
the scent &apos;s gone .
she won &apos;t cry anymore .
she &apos;s gone forever .
will you come back to my house now , Stella ?
- Come along , darling .
- All right .
- Get her out through the nursery , quick !
- Right .
- What is it , the cold ?
- Go on , Pam !
- What are you going to do ?
- Help Stella , please .
Mary Meredith , where are you ?
it &apos;s time somebody faced that icy rage of yours .
what do you want ?
it &apos;s Stella , isn &apos;t it ?
it &apos;s too late , Mary .
you see , we &apos;re on to you now .
you told Carmel to clear out and leave her baby , but Meredith wouldn &apos;t stand for it .
to spite them , you tried to kill their child and instead went hurtling over the cliff yourself .
gives your saintly legend a black eye , doesn &apos;t it ?
so you don &apos;t like the sound of laughter , do you ?
but that &apos;s all you &apos;ll get from now on .
I should think you &apos;ll be on your way now , Mary Meredith .
we &apos;ve had enough . we &apos;re not frightened of you anymore .
from now on , this house is for the living .
Rick , are you all right ?
let &apos; me in , Ric / cl
- Oh , Rick !
- You all right , Fitzgerald ?
Yes , fine . she &apos;s gone , Stella .
look !
he &apos;d never go near those stairs before .
Bobby &apos;ll be back tomorrow .
I think we &apos;ll be having other plans for Bobby .
you &apos;re still shaking , Rick .
well , I &apos;ve had a narrow escape .
she might have been my mother-in-law !
Yes , Mr. Prescott .
I know , you &apos;re the king of the jungle .
Oh , everybody knows me .
you can &apos;t have any fun around here .
what &apos;ll it be ?
bourbon , straight bourbon for everybody .
I &apos;m king of the jungle .
that &apos;ll be a dollar , Mr. Prescott .
and it &apos;s closing time .
don &apos;t rush me .
that &apos;s a lot of money to be carrying around , Mr. Prescott .
only ten grand .
I carry ten times more than that without losing a dime .
I don &apos;t believe in banks .
I tried them , you see .
I &apos;m gonna paint the town red tonight , yes , siree .
and when Sam Prescott paints the town ...
Oh , much obliged ...
and when Sam Prescott paints the town red ... he won &apos;t get home until morning .
I won &apos;t get home until morning .
I won &apos;t ...
maybe I won &apos;t get home at all .
here &apos;s your chance , mister .
ask him .
what is it , friend , what &apos;s on your mind ?
the town &apos;s full of conventions .
the guy can &apos;t get a room .
who says he can &apos;t ?
he can use mine .
any friend of Sam Prescott &apos;s is a friend of mine .
follow me , friend , just follow me .
I &apos;m king of the jungle .
that &apos;s right .
now take a deep breath .
ready ?
now , no fair cheating .
a deep breath , I said .
that &apos;s right , inhale ...
Exhale .
now , don &apos;t you feel much better ?
we &apos;re all set .
bend , stretch , bend , stretch .
touch your toes , bend , stretch .
touch your toes , now .
Ah , you can do it .
that &apos;s better .
bend , tretch .
bend , stretch .
bend , stretch ...
bend ...
look now , I &apos;ve got 26 rooms to clean and I can &apos;t upset my schedule .
please , Mr. Prescott , don &apos;t be difficult .
Mr. Prescott .
pardon me .
excuse me , sir .
come in .
excuse me , folks .
the train &apos;s crowded .
I wonder if a young lady could sit here for a spell .
Oh , I guess so .
thank you , sir .
this way , Miss .
are you married ?
this is my first trip to New York .
I was just married , too .
I mean ...
you folks know what I mean .
Yeah .
so you were just married .
Uh-huh .
I guess it &apos;s pretty obvious .
well , go on , tell us all about it .
where did you first meet him ?
I was working in a little restaurant in Grantsville , Ohio ...
that &apos;s where I live .
one day he just came in .
love at first sight , eh ?
no , I didn &apos;t even pay much attention to him .
it was strange .
I remember our first date .
I didn &apos;t want to go , but ...
somehow that night I just found myself waiting for him .
we just walked .
he didn &apos;t say much .
it &apos;s hard to explain , but ...
I felt that same strangeness .
you mean you only met this man 3 times and then married him ?
Huh-huh .
what &apos;s he do for a living ?
he sells something or other , I really don &apos;t know .
and he left you right after you were married .
he was called away on business .
it &apos;s almost as if you had married a stranger , isn &apos;t it ?
call for Mr. King .
call for Mr. King .
call for Mr. King .
call for Mr. King .
good morning .
good morning .
I &apos;m Mrs. Baxter .
Yes , Mrs. Baxter .
my husband reserved a room .
excuse me , I &apos;ll see .
that &apos;s right .
he called in yesterday afternoon .
room 1210 .
Mr. Baxter didn &apos;t get here yet ?
no , he didn &apos;t .
Oh ...
Junior !
Millie .
Fred .
thank you .
don &apos;t , Fred , please .
what &apos;s the matter , Millie ?
just don &apos;t know how to tell you .
tell me what ?
what are you doing here ?
you got my letter .
what letter ?
well , why are you here ?
my husband sent for me .
your husband ?
I &apos;m married , Fred ...
I didn &apos;t ...
do I know him ?
I don &apos;t think so .
his name is Paul Baxter .
when were you married ?
a month ago , in Grantsville .
what are you doing here at the Sherwin ?
this is a salesmen &apos;s hotel .
Paul &apos;s a salesman .
so am I , remember ?
that &apos;s the reason you wouldn &apos;t marry me .
Paul apparently was a better salesman .
congratulations .
thank you .
Fred .
what did you write in that letter ?
Oh , it doesn &apos;t matter now .
Yes ?
Yes , Mrs. Baxter .
no , Mrs. Baxter .
Yes , I &apos;ll put all calls through , no matter how late .
anything for me , Charlie ?
no , sorry , not a thing .
Hey , Charlie , take a look at this , will you ?
Hello ?

I &apos;m sorry , I can &apos;t hear you .

Oh .
Oh , Fred .

I said thanks for calling .

good morning .

no .
well , you better have some breakfast .
good morning .
your order , please .
no , Fred , please , I couldn &apos;t .
Oh , come on , have some coffee or something .
no , thank you .
I &apos;m terribly worried about Paul .
you &apos;re sure he knew you were coming .
he sent me this telegram .
I &apos;ve been making calls all morning .
I even checked the hospitals .
it was sent from Philadelphia .
that &apos;s only a few hours from here by train .
I know .
I wish there were something I could do .
well , there &apos;s the police .
police ?
the Bureau of Missing Persons .
how do I get there ?
come on .
but I don &apos;t want to take you from your work , Fred .
Oh , that &apos;ll keep .
come on .
homicide squad .
he wanted me to meet him here yesterday morning and he hasn &apos;t shown up .
well you got the wrong department .

Oh , yes , he &apos;s a salesman .

he used to come in to the restaurant where I worked .
how long did you know him before you were married ?

Yes .

Oh , yes , he &apos;s 34 and ... about six feet tall , dark hair and dark eyes .
any distinguishing marks such as scars , moles , birthmarks ?
I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t think so .
how was he dressed the last time you saw him ?
he was wearing a dark suit with a white shirt and sort of a dark tie .
anything else you can tell me ?
you will find him , won &apos;t you ?
we &apos;ll do our best .
but you &apos;ve practically married a stranger .
thank you , Lieutenant .
do you want me to turn this over to the Missing Persons Bureau ?
I &apos;ll handle it .
you ?
the telegram was sent from Philadelphia .
the night of the Convention murder .
you think maybe ...
I don &apos;t think anything .
check Western Union , Philadelphia .
excuse me .
you can go , Fred .
hm ?
go on , go ahead , you don &apos;t have to stay here with me .
I have no place to go .
I know you better .
this is like old times back in Grantsville .
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m gonna do , Fred .
I can &apos;t go back to Grantsville .
you don &apos;t have to , Millie .
new York &apos;s a big place .
I can &apos;t stay here .
I &apos;d be looking for him every place I go .
the places are all alike , Millie .
you can &apos;t run away from yourself .
Hello ?
Oh , Paul .
Oh , darling , it &apos;s so good to hear your voice .
where are you ?
what &apos;s happened ?
Oh , come right over , darling , right away .

why ?

I &apos;ll come to you , darling , tell me where , please , please , Paul .
corner of 7th and Bleeker .
I &apos;m leaving right away .
Bye , darling .
why didn &apos;t he come here ?
I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t care .
seventh and Bleeker isn &apos;t a very healthy neighborhood .
I better come along .
no , thanks , Fred .
Oh , Fred .
I couldn &apos;t let you come alone .
he &apos;s in there .
in there .
he &apos;s gone .
who &apos;s gone ?
it &apos;s a different man .
you sure you saw him ?
he was sitting right in that chair .
come on , we &apos;ll get a cab .
good morning .
good morning .
Oh , Mr. Graham , if you &apos;re looking fo Mrs. Baxter , she just checked out .
that &apos;s right , just about five minutes ago .

no .
there was a telephone call though just a few minutes before she checked out .
thanks .
Hello , Millie .
Paul !
Oh , Paul .
getting lonely , Millie ?
Oh , Paul , Paul , darling .
I &apos;ve been so worried , so upset .
why didn &apos;t you meet me last night ?
now , now , baby .
there &apos;s nothing to be worried and upset about .
everything is all right .
sure .
why didn &apos;t you meet me last night ?
I asked you to come by yourself last night , Millie .
Oh , that was Fred .
Hr &apos;s staying at the Sherwin .
I used to know him in Grantsville .
I think I told you about him .
he used to go through there on business .
does he know where you are now ?
you told me not to tell anyone .
why don &apos;t you let the sun in ?
do you know something ?
I haven &apos;t had a thing to eat since the night before last .
I &apos;m starving .
well , I &apos;m sorry .
there isn &apos;t a thing in the place to eat .
I &apos;ll tell you what we &apos;ll do ...
I know .
I &apos;ll go ut and buy something .
I &apos;ll be right back .
Paul .
Paul .
I thought you were out .
no .
you look nice .
thank you .
thank you .
Oh , Paul , the person who lived here before left his card on our mailbox .
no , he didn &apos;t .
but the name is Moore on our box .
well , I use that name sometimes .
why ?
huh ?
why ?
business reasons .
Oh .
who &apos;s that ?
I don &apos;t know .
it was here when I moved in .
here .
well , let &apos;s go .
go ?

I just got the groceries .
we &apos;re gonna eat .
the groceries will keep .
I &apos;ve decided to take you out and feed you .
and then , you hick , I &apos;m gonna show you the city of New York .
Oh , that &apos;s wonderful .
I want to see all of New York .
and ... do you know what I &apos;d like to do after that ?
what ?
I &apos;d like to see Coney Island .
Coney Island ?
all right .
then we will see Coney Island , too .

she &apos;s a stenographer .

she &apos;s a nurse . right ?
that &apos;s right .
now , who &apos;s next .
don &apos;t be bashful , don &apos;t be bashful .

I wanna try .
thank you so much .
you were just married .
next !
as a wedding present to this young couple
I am going to guess what this young man does absolutely free of charge .
step right up , brother .
come on .
it &apos;s just a little entertainment .
Hugo won &apos;t hurt you .
he &apos;s a reporter .
right ?
no .
he &apos;s a lawyer .
right ?
no .
he works in a bank .
right ?
no .
I can &apos;t guess what you do .
it &apos;s the first time I ever missed , stranger .
here you are .
well , everybody &apos;s got to have a miss now and then .
Paul .
Yeah ?
I &apos;d like to invite someone to dinner .
who ?
Fred Graham .
I told you about him .
he &apos;s ...
Yes , I remember him .
Hey , give me my marble .
no .
it &apos;s my marble .
no !
kids squabbling over marbles .
Twenty years from now they &apos;ll still be squabbling .
but over money instead of marbles .
people don &apos;t change much , do they ?
will Tuesday be all right ?
I &apos;d rather you didn &apos;t , Millie .
but ...
I owe an awful lot to Fred .
maybe you do , but ...
I don &apos;t want him over .
I do .
I don &apos;t .
come on over here .
come on .
I &apos;m mad , you know that , don &apos;t you ?
your eggs are burning , you know that , don &apos;t you ?
you still mad ?
a little .
the Philadelphia silk stocking murder ...
what did you say ?
nothing .
Jacob Houser , a hotel bartender who can identify the killer has left Philadelphia for an undisclosed destination .
Jacob Houser is the sole witness ...
where are you going ?
I &apos;ve got to make a call , Millie .
I &apos;ll see you later .
I tell you , he tried to kill me .
he only missed me by that much .
I tell you he tried to kill me .
it might have been accidental .
did you get a look at the man who was driving the truck ?
no .
but why should anyone want to murder me ?
maybe you know too much .
you mean ...
it &apos;s a pity that you can &apos;t remember the name of the hotel .
like I said , I caught a peak at the guy &apos;s suitcase when he left the bar with Prescott .
the label said Hotel something or other .
new York City , that &apos;s what it said .
that &apos;s what it said .
can &apos;t you tell me something more about the man ?
like I said , he was sort of a salesman of some kind .
he was about 6 foot tall , dark hair , dark eyes ...
he had on a dark suit .
dark eyes , dark hair and a dark suit .
there are thousands of men who fit that description here in New York .
Yeah ...
that makes it tough .
if you could only remember that hotel label on the killer &apos;s suitcase .
I can &apos;t .
I can &apos;t , I can &apos;t .
your life may depend on it .
I can &apos;t .
I can &apos;t , I can &apos;t .
your life may depend on it .
that &apos;s it .
Sherwin . that &apos;s it .
are you sure ?
sure .
she checked out early yesterday morning .
did her husband ever show up ?
no , not that I know of .
was Mrs. Baxter friendly with anyone in the hotel ?
Yes , er ...
Fred Graham .
I think you &apos;ll find him downstairs in the ...
the city is a nice place to live in , all right but I &apos;ll take a home in the country anytime .
well , that depends on what you call living .
you can &apos;t raise kids in the city .
I didn &apos;t know everybody was married .
everyone should be .
well , sometimes things just don &apos;t work out the way you figure .
how are the ball games coming along ?
they &apos;re playing a double-headed today .
we &apos;ve still got time to see the second game .
I &apos;d sure like to see it .
let &apos;s go .
no , I gotta get back to headquarters .
you &apos;re gonna get a rubdown ?
Oh , I might as well .
come on .
I can &apos;t promise you anything as exciting as the ball game , Mr. Graham , but I think you &quot; ll get a kick out of this .
make yourself at home .
this was a case I worked on a couple of years ago .
Albert Foster .
he was a mild little sales clerk .
wouldn &apos;t harm a soul .
he was pulling down $ 35 a week and he was happy with it .
and then one day , Albert fell in love .
cute kid .
Albert talked Dolly into marrying him .
promised her the moon , told her he was making big money .
in order to make good on his promises , Albert stayed late at the store one night when everyone had gone home .
everyone but Albert &apos;s employer .
Mr. Simmons .
while the boss was figuring up the day &apos;s takings
Albert sneaked up behind him and hit him over the head with a fire axe .
he hit him three times , Mr. Graham , splitting the skull wide open .
then Albert grabbed the money and left town taking Dolly with him .
did you ever catch him ?
Yes .
we caught him .
after he &apos;d killed three more people with the same axe .
Robert Fisk .
Herbert Cain .
Ernest Boyd .
well , you tell a good story , Lieutenant .
I had a good reason , Mr. Graham .
I daresay you &apos;ve read about the silk stocking murder in Philadelphia .
Uh-huh .
the killer got away with $ 10,000 .
a man who murders once for money will go on murdering for money , like Albert Foster .
Yes , I suppose .
where &apos;s Mrs. Baxter ?
I don &apos;t know .
the desk clerk said you were pretty friendly with her .
are you sure you don &apos;t know where she is ?
I told you I didn &apos;t .
I haven &apos;t finished .
do you mind ?
there &apos;s one more slide .
Sidney Johnson .
the friend who covered up for Albert Foster .
Sidney told us that Albert left the store with him at 6 o &apos;clock .
that held us up long enough for Albert to commit three more murders .
good day , Mr. Graham .
Fred .
what are you doing here ?
I thought I &apos;d drop in and tell the lieutenant I find Paul .
let &apos;s get out of here .
but ...
he wanted to know where you were living .
but didn &apos;t you tell him I found Paul ?
well , I think he wants it for another reason .
what other reason ?
what other reason ?
there was some sort of trouble in Philadelphia .
what kind of trouble .
he didn &apos;t say .
well , whatever it is , I &apos;m sure Paul had nothing to do with it .
of course he didn &apos;t .
Millie , hasn &apos;t Paul told you anything ?
well , he &apos;s worried about something , but ... he doesn &apos;t want to talk about it .
where does Paul work ?
the Anderson Shirt Company .
Oh , Anderson .
they &apos;re right up the street from us .
listen , I &apos;ll check with them to see if I can find anything out .
where can I reach you tonight ?
I &apos;ll call you .
okay , Millie .
any time after eight .
do you like it ?
it was a bargain .
I know I shouldn &apos;t have , but ...
well , I can take it back .
no , keep it .
it &apos;s nice , Do you really like it ?
are you sure ?
I &apos;m sure .
I really like it .
it certainly took you a long time to find it , though .
I spent most of the time window shopping .
I ran into Fred Graham .
I didn &apos;t tell him where we lived .
Oh , here , let me .
when will you be leaving town ?
Fred can hardly wait , huh ?
seriously , Paul .
can &apos;t you take me with you ?
seriously , I can &apos;t take you with me .
why not ?
sweetie , you know I can &apos;t drag you all over the country ... eating in one-armed joints and sleeping in third-rate hotels .
can &apos;t you take me along when you make the big cities , like Pittsburg , Boston , Philadelphia ?
that &apos;s not my territory .
but that telegram you sent me , wasn &apos;t that from Philadelphia ?
Oh , sure , I er ... wrote that between trains passing through .
look , let &apos;s get out of here , have dinner and take in a movie .
all right , I &apos;m ready .
get your coat .
here we go .
we &apos;re getting in right at the finish .
the usher will seat you , sir .
Hello , Millie ?
Yeah .
I checked with the Anderson Shirt Company
they haven &apos;t got a thing against Paul .
he was one of their best men .
what do you mean was ?
well , he gave up his job a few days ago .
Yeah , that &apos;s right .
no , they can &apos;t understand why .
he just mailed them a swell bunch of orders from stores they &apos;ve been trying to get for years .
Yeah , I know them myself .
they &apos;re the best accounts in Philadelphia .
do you have a Philadelphia paper ?
no , we ain &apos;t got them .
are you sure ?
pretty sure .
could you look ?
what date ?
August 12th .
no , we ain &apos;t got that one .
would you please look .
August 12th .
thank you .
what &apos;ll it be ?
nothing .
paper , Mister ?
do you have a Philadelphia paper ?
August 12th .
I got your call , Millie .
what &apos;s up ?
Oh , yes , I know about that one .
Blake told me .
what &apos;ll it be ?
nothing .
I thought there was something wrong , but ...
nothing like this .
hasn &apos;t he told you anything ?
I didn &apos;t ask him .
you mean to tell me you made up your mind just from reading this paper ?
I found that .
all right .
so he is a clothing salesman .
so are a million other guys .
he told you he wasn &apos;t in Philadelphia the other day and I found out that he was .
but he was in the hotel .
Yes , but when ?
I &apos;ve carried match folders around with me for months .
he changed his name .
why should he do that ?
there could be a hundred reasons .
I know you put each one of these little things together and they make it airtight .
but you take each one separately ... you find a simple answer .
you think he &apos;s the man they &apos;re looking for , don &apos;t you ?
I &apos;m going to find out .
Millie , let me have your telephone number .
I &apos;ll call you in half an hour and see if everything &apos;s all right .
Parkview 34608 .
the Windsor Apartments on 12th Street .
apartment C .
Millie ...
that letter I wrote you ...
what letter ?
the one I mailed to Grantsville .
the one I wrote before I knew you were married .
I &apos;ll call you in half an hour .
murderer .
I &apos;ll tell you what he is in one guess .
he &apos;s a murderer .
murderer .
he &apos;s a murderer , he &apos;s a murderer , he &apos;s a murderer ...
a murderer .
murderer .
murderer .
is your headache any better ?
couldn &apos;t figure out what happened to you .
I bought a paper .
a Philadelphia paper .
haven &apos;t you anything to say ?
haven &apos;t you anything to say ?
just going away .
on another business trip .
no .
for good .
Hello .
Yes .
Yes , I &apos;ll do that .
the call was for you .
he said he &apos;d call back .
Paul .
where is he ?
I don &apos;t know .
I &apos;m trying to keep you out of this , Mrs. Baxter .
I &apos;m not asking you to help us , but ... don &apos;t help him .
there &apos;s something you can do .
thank you , Mrs. Baxter .
why did you come back ?
I never got out .
you can &apos;t stay here .
Yes , I know .
I won &apos;t get you into any further trouble .
I wasn &apos;t thinking of myself .
you said that as though you meant it .
I do .
where are you going ?
what &apos;s the difference ?
I wouldn &apos;t ask if I didn &apos;t care .
they &apos;re still out there .
you &apos;d better go now .
I &apos;ll meet you at 7th and Bleeker .
go ahead .
they won &apos;t stop you .
good evening .
the guy we want .
we can always spot him .
just find this guy Baxter .
Millie .
Oh , Paul .
were you followed ?
no .
you know , they &apos;re not so dumb .
they figured it would be easier to spot us together .
do you want to go on alone ?
no .
how did you know that they wouldn &apos;t follow me ?
when Blake asked for your photograph I gave them the one on the mantlepiece .
what time does the car leave for Dallas ?
there ain &apos;t no car leaving for Dallas tonight .
is there any car leaving tonight ?
for where ?
anywhere .
on the way to Dallas .
well , there &apos;s a car leaving for Louisville .
tonight ?
should have been here 20 minutes ago .
is there room for two ?
two ?
my husband and I .
that &apos;ll be $ 10 apiece .
don &apos;t I get any tickets ?
there ain &apos;t no tickets .
just take a seat till the car gets here .
thank you .
that &apos;s good .
sit down .
how many for Louisville ?
the mother , him and them two .
let &apos;s go .
stop the car !
keep driving and don &apos;t stop .
he &apos;s won !
he &apos;s won !
the champ &apos;s here .
Hooray for the champ .
what a fight .
one more round and he &apos;d have killed him .
he sure would , but that was really a tough one .
when are you gonna pick a winner ?
well , maybe next time .
who knows ?
your luck can &apos;t hold out that long .
probably won &apos;t ever be a next time .
Hello .
I ...
I &apos;m looking for a room .
what do you want ?
I &apos;m looking for a room .
are you alone ?
Yes .
right this way .
well ?
how much is it ?
any luggage ?
my bags are at the depot .
then you have to pay a week in advance .
that &apos;s $ 5 .
no cooking .
we &apos;ll be safe here overnight , anyway .
it &apos;s not a pretty story , is it ?
you better lie down .
get some rest .
Millie ... there &apos;s something I &apos;ve got to tell you .
tell me in the morning , darling .
no , I &apos;ve got to tell you now .
you know , it &apos;s funny ... how things work out sometimes , isn &apos;t it ?
how everything ... well , sometimes things completely change in a single night .
you go along for years batting your brains out for $ 50 a week ... and that $ 50 seems like ... well , just about the most important thing in the world to you .
and then , suddenly ... you meet a guy that carries ...
ten grand .
I carry ten times that much without losing a dime .
I don &apos;t believe in banks , you see ?
I tried it once .
$ 10,000 , Millie .
$ 10,000 .
and there it was , lying on the floor .
right in front of me .
I was worried about your coming to New York .
I was worried about how I was gonna take care of you how we &apos;d make out together .
it didn &apos;t seem right that a man like that should have all that money .
then I ... may have wanted his money ...
but ...
I didn &apos;t kill him .
Paul .
I didn &apos;t , Millie , I didn &apos;t kill him .
why did you hide ?
who &apos;d believe me ?
what are they doing to him ?
I ...
I don &apos;t know .
will you let me see him ?
I ain &apos;t got no say here .
aren &apos;t you a detective ?
no , I &apos;m only a bartender .
you &apos;re Jacob Houser .
I &apos;m sorry , Mrs. Baxter .
all I did was tell them the truth .
I &apos;m not blaming you .
you been married long ?
five weeks tomorrow .
Mrs. Baxter .
you can go .
can &apos;t I see him ?
not right now .
well , when ?
tomorrow , maybe .
excuse me .
good evening .
good evening , is Mr. Graham in ?
he &apos;s on the roof garden .
shall I connect you ?
no , no , I &apos;ll go up .
Mrs. Baxter ...
Yes ?
a letter for you .
letter ?
Yes , forwarded from Grantsville .
Oh , Fred &apos;s letter .
roof garden , please .
well , how did things go ?
I couldn &apos;t see him .
too windy for you up here ?
no .
Oh , your letter came .
let me have it .
let me read it .
no , you don &apos;t want to know ...
Oh , please .
hotel Phladelphia .
that present .
it was a pair of silk stockings .
you never sent them .
you were in the Hotel Philadelphia that night .
the night Prescott was ...
Fred .
you .
now I understand .
you weren &apos;t trying to find Paul for me but for the police .
that &apos;s why you took me to Lieutenant Blake instead of the Missing Persons Bureau .
now I know why you stopped me from telling Blake I &apos;d found Paul .
you wanted this letter ...
you had to get hold of it before I found out what had happened in Philadelphia .
don &apos;t you see ?
he did it , not Paul .
I &apos;ll have to have more than your word for it , Mrs. Baxter .
but the stocking , that letter .
there &apos;s no mention here of any stockings .
it just says here er ...
&quot; ... that present I promised you &quot; .
it doesn &apos;t mean a thing .
there must be some way I can prove it .
something we can do ...
we haven &apos;t found the money yet .
don &apos;t be too hopeful .
have a car ready .
there &apos;s no use in your waiting .
you go on home .
if there &apos;s anything , I &apos;ll call you .
well , come in , Lieutenant , I &apos;ve been expecting you .
wait here .
Mr. Graham , did you promise Mrs. Baxter a pair of silk stockings ?
Yes , I did .
but I ... couldn &apos;t get them .
what about your letter ?
well , I got her something else instead .
it was sort of supposed to be a surprise .
may I see it ?
sure .
do you mind if we search the room ?
go ahead .
if you find $ 10,000 , I &apos;ll split it with you .
come in , boys .
shall we wait in the hall ?
I don &apos;t like this any more than you , Mr. Graham , but we have to follow up every lead .
Oh , I understand .
you know , you &apos;d be surprised how much it takes to convict a murderer .
you have a jury of about 12 ordinary people .
they &apos;ve never even seen a murderer .
they expect some wild-eyed maniac with blood in his hands .
when you show them someone who looks the same as they ... they just don &apos;t believe you .
that &apos;s why we have to clear up all the loose ends ... so it &apos;s airtight .
am I keeping you from something ?
I &apos;d like to catch the 11 : 15 , I &apos;m due in Atlanta on Thursday .
you &apos;ll make it .
you take that Albert Foster .
I showed you his picture .
did we have a time convicting him .
and with four bodies to show , too .
there was one little lady on the jury who tied up the verdict for six days just because she couldn &apos;t believe a man with such a sweet smile was a killer .
then there was Professor ...
Professor ...
Stanley .
remember him ?
sure .
sure ?
sure what ?
you were telling me about Albert Foster .
I &apos;d finished about Albert Foster .
I was talking about Professor Stanley .
tell me about him , I &apos;d like to hear it .
you &apos;re not interested .
sure , I am .
tell me .
forget it .
say , do you remember that woman who poisoned her six husbands for their insurance ?
what was her name ?
Goldsmith , Emma Goldsmith .
and the man in the case , the chauffeur , wasn &apos;t it , they ... collected over $ 100,000 .
they would have gotten away with it , too , if it hadn &apos;t been for Emma Goldsmith ...
Borden .
Emma Borden .
no , It was Goldsmith .
you &apos;re thinking of somebody else
this was Goldsmith , I ...
I remember distinctly , I know a buyer in Miami named Goldsmith .
Herbert Goldsmith .
I thought about him as soon as I read about the case .
took me up to his house one time .
he &apos;s got a beautiful house on the hill overlooking the ocean
there are no hills in Miami .
no , that &apos;s right , he didn &apos;t live in Miami .
he lived just outside .
you oughta see the house .
the most beautiful view you &apos;ve ever seen .
fifteen rooms and a garden that ...
shut up !
hold him .
do you have a letter there addressed to Fred Graham , Atlanta , Georgia ?
Fred Graham ?
Fred Graham .
Abercrombie .
Johnson .
Kirtch .
excuse me , please .
pardon me .
excuse me .
excuse me .
excuse me .
come in .
excuse me , folks , but ... the train &apos;s crowded .
I wonder if a young lady could sit here for a spell .
bring her in .
thank you , sir .
this way , please .
I was just married , too .
pardon me .
tell us all about it , my dear .
well , I was working in a restaurant and ... he came in one day .
and so he said he liked me and ... that &apos;s how it started .
Subtitles : Luís Filipe Bernardes .
- Father O &apos;Malley .
- Yes .
housekeeper :
welcome to St. Mary &apos;s .
father : thank you .
housekeeper : I suppose you &apos;re tired after traveling .
father : it &apos;s pretty tiresome , all the way in the day coach .
housekeeper : your room &apos;s all ready .
there &apos;s nothing to do now but go to bed .
father : is Father Fogarty still here ?
no . they took him away this morning .
poor man . my heart went out to him .
father :
poor man ?
why ? you &apos;ll find out .
I think you &apos;ll find everything you want here .
couldn &apos;t I get you a cup of tea ?
no , thanks .
I don &apos;t understand what you mean about Father Fogarty .
I &apos;ll find out what ?
what Father Fogarty found out .
the poor man .
there you go again . what happened to him ?
they took him away mumbling to himself in a wheelchair .
they took him away ?
where ? Shady Rest .
he even said a prayer for you ... that your stay here might be successful and enjoyable ... though he doubted it .
he had very definite ideas about running this school ... about the education of children , and so have they .
they ?
the sisters .
father Fogarty said they wanted their way in everything ... and after he was confined to a wheelchair , they had it .
maybe he was just getting along in years .
no .
he looked all right when he got here .
that &apos;s strange .
I don &apos;t anticipate any trouble .
you don &apos;t ?
you &apos;ve never been pastor of a parochial school , then .
it &apos;s my first experience .
Oh .
well ... I see you don &apos;t know what it means ... to be up to your neck in nuns .
no .
good night .
good night .
sleep well tonight .
&#91; bell RINGS &#93;
&#91; ringing STOPS &#93;
father : good morning , Sister . I &apos;m Father O &apos;Malley .
Angela : good morning .
this is our school bell .
we usually ring it an hour from now when the children are here .
could I see Sister Superior ?
is she up ? I &apos;m sure she is .
- Will you come with me ?
Angela : good morning , Sam .
Sam : good morning .
father :
sister Benedict and the others ... are eager to meet you .
I &apos;ll tell her you &apos;re here .
father : thank you .
&#91; Meow &#93;
I &apos;m sorry .
our cat had kittens , and they &apos;re all over .
the father &apos;s a member of the parish , I presume .
excuse me .
I &apos;ll tell Sister you &apos;re here .
nun : good morning .
father : won &apos;t you sit ?
nun : good morning .
father : would you sit ?
nun : good morning .
nun : good morning .
many NUNS : good morning .
two NUNS : good morning .
nun : good morning .
nun : good morning .
father : this has been my ...
Angela : this is Sister Superior .
father O &apos;Malley , Sister Mary Benedict .
father :
how do you do ? Benedict :
how do you do ?
sisters , this is Father O &apos;Malley .
father : how do you do ?
he &apos;s a substitute for Father Fogarty ... who has departed for a much needed rest .
we hope your stay will be pleasant .
father :
thank you . we look forward expectantly to your views as an educator .
I &apos;m sure Father wishes to say a few words .
Yes , I ...
St. Mary &apos;s has been here many years ... and has seen the labors of many sisters of your order .
I know the work hasn &apos;t been easy .
in the eyes of the world , very few take notice ... but earthly honors and rewards are not for you .
you &apos;ve sent forth generations of pupils ... who have been a credit to the teachings inculcated here .
St. Mary &apos;s has grown old doing good .
as for myself ...
I &apos;m happy I &apos;ve been selected as pastor of St. Mary &apos;s .
&#91; laughter &#93;
working in a parish where there &apos;s a parish school ... is going to prove a new experience for me ... and I &apos;m sure a very interesting one .
&#91; laughter &#93;
I see what you mean .
however , as in all things ... we assume our assigned task without complaint ... and with a hopeful view to the future .
&#91; laughter &#93;
father :
by the epistle of St. Peter , where he says ...
&quot; be sober and watch . &quot;
&#91; laughter &#93;
father :
was it St. Paul ?
just to get serious for a moment , it ...
in conclusion , may I say that I &apos;m happy ...
&#91; school BELL RINGS &#93;
Benedict :
I &apos;m sorry , but that &apos;s the first bell ... and the sisters have to go to their classes .
care to talk to the pupils before the second bell ?
you may prefer speaking to the children .
father : I &apos;d certainly be more at ease .
I want to speak to you , too .
children :
I pledge allegiance to the flag ... of the United States of America ... and to the republic for which it stands ... one nation , indivisible ... with liberty and justice for all .
Benedict :
children . our new pastor , Father O &apos;Malley , wishes to speak to you .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;ll be glad to greet him ... and I &apos;m sure he has something important to say .
father : children , you &apos;ll see a lot of me in the future .
I &apos;m going to be here a great deal .
here &apos;s the shortest speech you ever heard ...
this is a holiday . take the day off .
children :
father : pretty effective speech , huh ?
I had to get my self-confidence back .
when we were kids , we lived for holidays .
we shouldn &apos;t get far away from our childhood .
Benedict : do you realize what you &apos;ve done ?
they &apos;re liable to get into mischief .
the responsibility is yours .
it seemed like a good idea .
you can &apos;t call a holiday just like that .
you have to get permission of the superintendent of schools .
what will we tell him ?
I &apos;ll call him .
he really needs a holiday .
I may give him the day off .
father : my school wasn &apos;t like this .
I could look out the window ... and see fields , trees , the old swimming hole .
hang your clothes on the tree .
last out finds them tied in knots .
- Where ?
- Missouri .
I came from Ireland .
&#91; speaking IRISH &#93;
I used to .
where you from ?
I was born in Sweden , but when I was small ...
father : don &apos;t tell me .
Minnesota . Benedict : that &apos;s right .
I love the winter .
I used to ski to school , and there was one big hill .
Oh .
father : you carry them home after .
Michael : she was a tomboy from what I hear .
father :
that so ? Michael : she played baseball and football with the boys .
father :
how good were you at ... BENEDICT :
I hit over.300. FATHER : that &apos;s in the wheat belt .
we had it better than these kids .
they haven &apos;t even got a place to play .
Benedict : that used to be our playground .
father : over there ?
Michael : Yes . we sold the ground .
Benedict : we needed money to fix our building .
they were going to condemn it .
father : where &apos;d you put the money ?
Benedict :
you &apos;d be surprised . we installed a new sprinkler system , fire escapes .
Michael : the foundation had to be reinforced .
father : hardly seems worth it .
Benedict :
father : Yes . of course .
what are the other classrooms like ?
father : what &apos;s going on up there ?
Michael : roof repair .
it leaks . Benedict :
a trifle . father : you &apos;re overcrowded , aren &apos;t you ?
Michael :
Yes . Benedict :
father :
looks like St. Mary &apos;s is in a bad way ... a trifle .
Benedict : we &apos;re relying on you to help us .
father : too bad you don &apos;t have a building like that .
that would be your answer to everything .
Benedict : that &apos;s where we intended our new St. Mary &apos;s .
a building very much like that .
there it is , only we don &apos;t own it .
confidentially , that &apos;s what we &apos;ve been praying for .
father :
that the owner will wake up one morning ... and give it to us .
father : that who would wake up when and give you what ?
Michael : Mr. Bogardus , the owner .
Benedict : that &apos;s what we &apos;re praying for .
father : Oh , woman , great is thy faith .
Benedict : if faith can move mountains ...
father : you figured you could move right in ?
Benedict :
Yes . father : you &apos;ve got to be practical .
anybody ask the owner about this ?
Michael :
no , we just prayed . Benedict : that &apos;s where you could help us .
father : what do I do when he says no ?
&#91; car HORN HONKS &#93;
&#91; HONK HONK &#93;
&#91; HONK &#93;
&#91; HONK HONK &#93;
Bogardus : all you kids ! get out of there !
why aren &apos;t you in school ?
father : they shouldn &apos;t be doing that .
Benedict : after all , it &apos;s a holiday .
father :
Michael : that &apos;s Mr. Bogardus .
Benedict : we better go now .
tell him why the children aren &apos;t in school .
father : want me to say anything about the building ?
some other time .
Bogardus : Hey , you , here .
father : what &apos;s going on here ?
- You see that fence ?
- Yeah . see what those children are ...
who are you ?
I &apos;m the new pastor .
see to it that those brats are punished .
I &apos;ll handle it , Mr. Bogardus .
I will censure them severely .
you know who I am ?
Yes , I do .
you the fella I &apos;m to do business with ?
I &apos;m here to make some recommendations .
I &apos;ve been looking over the school .
you have ?
what do you think of it ?
looks pretty tired .
tired is no name for it .
if you don &apos;t sell ... You got my offer , right ?
- Right here .
- What do you say ? it &apos;s a difficult decision .
I can &apos;t jump at it .
if you don &apos;t sell to me , it &apos;s going to be condemned .
by whom ?
the City Council . how do you know ?
I &apos;m chairman .
you are ? you &apos;re darned right .
when they order you to tear it down ... you &apos;ve got to pay for it .
you look like a practical man .
I do ?
there &apos;s not a mother or father in the parish ... that wouldn &apos;t rather see their children over at St. Victor &apos;s .
fine modern building . everything up to date .
sunlight , good heat in the winter .
I &apos;d never send my children into that firetrap .
you have any children ?
no .
- That &apos;s a long story .
- Skip it . all right .
how far do the children have to go to get to St. Victor &apos;s ?
as far as I had to go as a child .
let &apos;s walk over .
why not take my car ?
can &apos;t walk too much .
I &apos;ve got a bad ticker .
let &apos;s ride out to St. Victor &apos;s .
now you &apos;re talking .
Bogardus :
just close this school ... and send the children to St. Victor &apos;s . father :
sell the property to you ? that &apos;s right .
it &apos;s that simple .
you can always find me . I &apos;m here every day .
I won &apos;t do anything without talking to you .
I &apos;m a slow thinker , though .
you don &apos;t look it . no , sir .
Good-bye .
mother : father ?
father : how do you do ?
are you in charge of the school here ?
that &apos;s a question . I have some authority .
you look like a man who could understand my language .
let &apos;s find out .
start talking .
I &apos;d like very much to put my daughter in school here .
Mm-hmm .
you see , uh ...
I think it would be better ... if she was away from me for a while .
could she board ?
it might be arranged , but why did you ...
does she need any references ?
do you have to know very much about her background ? Yes .
that is customary .
well , um ...
it &apos;s like this .
I ran away from home when I was young to get married .
stop me if you &apos;ve heard this .
he left me a long time ago in Syracuse .
Thirteen years , to be exact .
did you get married ?
Yes , after a little argument .
I think he was afraid of settling down .
- He was a piano player . - Oh .
he had a wonderful smile .
I &apos;ll bet . mother :
very like yours .
he had a little band ... kind of a nonrecording orchestra .
did you ever hear of Gallagher &apos;s Gambleers ? no .
did anyone else ?
I doubt it .
anyway , the little band got an offer to play in Cincinnati .
he promised once he got money , he &apos;d send for me .
you were left alone in Syracuse ?
till the baby came .
you &apos;ve been supporting her all this time ?
Mm-hmm .
I suppose you &apos;re wondering as to how .
so is she .
she &apos;s getting to be a big girl now .
she &apos;s beginning to think I &apos;m no good .
I want to put her in your care ... before she finds out she &apos;s right .
anyone as concerned about their daughter as you ... isn &apos;t doing too badly .
if there was anything really wrong , you wouldn &apos;t care .
Joe was the only man I was ever really in love with , but ...
if you care so much , why didn &apos;t you look him up ?
I wouldn &apos;t know where to start .
besides ...
he ran out on me .
Oh , that &apos;s it .
I &apos;ll do the best I can for you .
what &apos;s your daughter &apos;s name ?
Patricia .
Patricia .
I &apos;ll make a deal with you .
I &apos;ll take care of your daughter , if you &apos;ll take care of yourself .
thank you .
father ...
- O &apos;Malley . - O &apos;Malley .
Good-bye , Mrs. Gallagher .
Good-bye .
Mrs. BREEN : a young lady &apos;s calling to see you .
father : send her in .
- Miss Gallagher ? - Yes .
father :
you &apos;ll board across the street with Mrs. Breen .
Patsy : that will be just lovely .
Mrs. BREEN : my boy will take your bags .
Eddie , take those bags to the back bedroom .
Eddie : ok , Mom .
father : well , Patricia ...
the sisters were expecting someone younger , and so was I .
Patsy : I was trying to look older .
I &apos;ve been looking for work .
I thought I &apos;d quit school and take a job .
I was up early answering ads .
I &apos;m perfectly able to take care of myself .
Patsy , you &apos;ll be very happy here at St. Mary &apos;s .
you &apos;ll enjoy every minute of it .
you &apos;ll find that life can be very bright , beautiful here .
the character came off .
let me look at you .
that &apos;s fine .
give us a chance , and we &apos;ll fix you up .
what do we got here ?
what are you smuggling ?
what is this here ?
it &apos;s a rat .
around here , you can &apos;t wear even a small mouse .
things are brightening up already , aren &apos;t they ?
Oh , goodness .
holy Toledo . look at that .
Patsy : you sent for me ?
Benedict : Yes , Patricia .
I wanted to talk to you .
you &apos;re falling behind in your studies .
if the work is too hard , I &apos;ll be glad to help .
that isn &apos;t it .
I guess I &apos;m just a featherhead .
don &apos;t you like school ?
you &apos;re holding back on me .
what &apos;s troubling you ?
nothing .
if you &apos;ll only work a little harder ... you &apos;ll get good marks .
we want to send your mother a nice report card .
you want your mother to be proud of you , right ?
that &apos;s all .
you may go .
thank you .
father : Hi , Pat .
Patsy : Hi .
father : how &apos;s she doing ?
Benedict : not very well .
no ?
I &apos;m sorry to hear that .
we accepted this child on your recommendation .
we know little about her parents .
what kind of home life did she have ?
the usual .
- You met her mother ?
- I have .
do you know Mrs. Gallagher well ?
Yes , I know her quite well .
did you meet her father ?
I &apos;ve heard about him .
what is his occupation ?
he &apos;s a ... musician .
they tell me he has a charming personality , too .
I like people who like music , don &apos;t you ?
are they separated ?
Yes .
is there anything I should know that would help ?
no , that &apos;s all that I ...
care to tell ?
Yes .
did anyone ever tell you you have a dishonest face ?
for a priest , I mean .
&#91; children SHOUTING &#93;
father : break it up .
I &apos;ll knock your two heads together .
the winner !
you &apos;re pretty shifty , aren &apos;t you ?
let &apos;s see you operate .
can &apos;t hit you . look at your shoe .
you got to keep watching .
Benedict : Eddie , come over here .
go inside and wash your face .
girl : why didn &apos;t you fight back ?
father : you &apos;re pretty handy . what &apos;s your name ?
Tommy :
Tommy Smith .
father : keep your head up .
he &apos;s all right .
Benedict : you better speak to Tommy .
he &apos;s new , and I &apos;m afraid he &apos;s a troublemaker .
he &apos;s a good fighter , though .
we don &apos;t tolerate fighting here .
if he continues to pick fights , we may have to send him away .
aren &apos;t we supposed to be educators ?
instead of sending him away , let &apos;s correct him .
I observed little correction in your attitude .
actually , I detected a slight note of pride .
naturally , I like to see a lad who takes care of himself .
on the outside , it &apos;s a man &apos;s world .
how are they doing ?
not too good .
you know what I mean .
sometimes a man has to fight his way through .
wouldn &apos;t it be better to ...
to think your way through ?
that &apos;s pure conjecture , of course ... from someone on the inside .
that &apos;s very well put , though .
don &apos;t you think sometimes in raising boys ... a woman &apos;s influence can be carried too far ?
you mean they may become sissies ?
that &apos;s right .
you look after Tommy , and I &apos;ll look after Eddie ... who lost the fight because he listened to me .
Benedict : Eddie ?
Eddie : Yes ?
come here . we &apos;ll fix you .
let me look at that .
how did this happen ?
I was minding my own business when Tommy trips me .
although I was very mad , I controlled myself ... like you said .
I said to him , &quot; Why &apos;d you do that ? &quot;
what did he say ?
he didn &apos;t say anything . he just hit me here .
fine thing .
then what did you do ?
I remembered what you said ...
I turned the other cheek .
then he really let me have it .
you &apos;re a very good boy .
I turned away to ignore him , and he kicked me !
Benedict : I &apos;m very proud of you .
I don &apos;t feel so hot .
Benedict : but you really won a victory over Tommy .
did I ?
Benedict : Yes . you were really the better man .
you and I know that .
nobody else knows it .
to tell you the truth , I don &apos;t know it .
nobody was proud of me .
even Father O &apos;Malley .
don &apos;t you think he thought Tommy was the best man ?
the better man .
I was thinking .
since I &apos;ve taken such a beating , and I &apos;ve been through so much ... maybe I wouldn &apos;t have to go to school today .
maybe .
but if you think I should go ...
I &apos;ll go no matter how bad I feel .
&#91; sister BENEDICT LAUGHS &#93;
Benedict : maybe I &apos;ll declare a holiday just for you .
Eddie : thanks .
clerk : are you interested in baseball ?
Benedict : Oh , yes , yes .
tell me , have you any textbooks ... on the manly art of self-defense ?
clerk : I beg your pardon ?
Michael : Oh , she means pugilistics .
Benedict : I mean boxing .
clerk : boxing ?
Yes , yes , of course .
they &apos;re right over here .
now , here &apos;s a book endorsed by James J. Corbett .
he won 10 straight fights .
nobody could lay a glove on him ... till Fitzsimmons knocked him out .
Michael : did Mr. Fitzsimmons write a book ?
Benedict : did Mr. Fitzsimmons write a book ?
no .
Oh , there &apos;s a very scholarly book here ... by Mr. Tunney .
Benedict : Oh , well , we &apos;ll take that .
that &apos;ll be $ 1.00 .
clerk : thank you . thank ...
Benedict : good afternoon .
clerk : good afternoon .
&#91; bells TOLLING &#93;
&#91; father WHISPERING IN LATIN &#93;
- Good afternoon , Father . - Good afternoon , Sister .
move this so we have more room . that &apos;s fine .
it &apos;s nice of you to come on a Saturday .
it &apos;s worth it , Sister .
I read this whole book last night .
it &apos;s perfect .
your homework , Sister ?
Benedict : Yeah .
now , the four most valuable punches ... it says here ... are ... now let me show you ... the straight left ... a right cross ... a left hook ... and a right uppercut .
see ?
now let me see how you stand .
Eddie : well ...
Benedict : like that ?
how do you fight ?
Eddie : well , uh ... like that .
Benedict : Oh , no , no . it &apos;s nothing like it .
we &apos;ll start from the beginning .
now put this foot back a bit .
back .
that &apos;s it . see how I stand ?
like this .
and bend your knees a little bit .
bend them .
uh , no , your toe should be in here .
that &apos;s right .
and your hands up like that .
Yes , that looks pretty good .
your head should be down . that &apos;s right .
now , that &apos;s fine .
now just like that .
let me see now , what do we do next ?
Yes . we start to move around .
we move around a little bit .
and keep ... uh , keep shooting your left .
that &apos;s right .
right .
Uh-huh .
that &apos;s good .
now , Eddie , keep your chin down like this ... and get your shoulder up .
well , I can &apos;t do it so well in this collar .
you know what I mean ?
you protect your chin that way .
and another thing , you have to be weaving .
weaving , that &apos;s right . and bobbing .
a moving target is much harder to hit . remember that .
for instance , if I try to hit you on this cheek ... you move to the other side .
you weave .
I &apos;m sorry .
sorry .
you should be weaving , you see what I mean ?
see , like that .
and now ...
got that ?
that &apos;s right .
now faster .
Eddie : gosh , that &apos;s better than turning the other cheek .
much more fun if they miss , don &apos;t you think ?
well , I &apos;ll admit ... it &apos;s easier on your face .
you said it , Sister .
well , now , where were we ?
let me see .
although they say this is the most valuable punch of all ... the left jab ... it seems this is the payoff .
now we &apos;ll try both hands .
the one ...
Eddie , keep your mouth closed .
that &apos;s very important . keep your mouth closed .
the man devoted two whole pages to that .
he meant if you don &apos;t , you &apos;ll be sorry .
now keep your mouth closed , real tight .
now we &apos;ll use both hands .
now , if I try to hit you here ... you block it with this hand .
that &apos;s right , and block it there ... and then again .
that &apos;s right .
that &apos;s right .
but be careful . look out for the payoff .
&#91; both GIGGLING &#93;
there are lots of things to remember ... lefts and rights and bobbing and weaving .
let &apos;s try them all .
move around .
come on . here we go . look me right in the eye .
see if you can anticipate my blows .
look out now .
look out .
Ohh .
that was very , very good .
that &apos;s splendid , Eddie .
Yes . you learn fast .
that &apos;s right .
now let &apos;s go again . come on .
move around .
you &apos;re so clumsy .
you have to be on your toes . move around quickly , you know ?
Oh , that &apos;s my fault . I forgot to mention footwork .
it says that footwork is almost a lost art .
it &apos;s very important . we have to learn it .
it &apos;s lots of fun . you &apos;ll like it .
see ?
sometimes it gets very fancy .
Yes , it &apos;s ...
well , maybe that &apos;s too much for the first lesson .
Yes .
I think we &apos;ll wait .
we have enough to think about .
just try now to ... You try to hit me .
that &apos;s right . come on . come on .
Uh-huh .
that &apos;s right . and then a little ...
no .
see ?
you just can &apos;t hit me , can you ?
go ahead , Eddie .
but I don &apos;t wanna hit you .
Oh , don &apos;t worry .
come on now .
I won &apos;t be there .
Ah , you see what I mean ?
you just can &apos;t ...
Benedict : Ohh !
I &apos;m sorry , Sister .
Oh , that &apos;s all right .
that &apos;s enough for the first lesson , though .
Eddie : you forgot your footwork .
you forgot something , didn &apos;t you ?
Benedict : something ?
I forgot everything .
I forgot to bob , I forgot to weave .
I had my mouth open .
&#91; GIGGLING &#93;
and I ran right into the payoff !
Ohh .
&#91; doorbell RINGS &#93;
good evening , Father . Patsy &apos;s right in here .
good .
- Hello , Father . - Eddie .
Mrs. BREEN : will you stop that and get off to bed ?
father :
stay up . you &apos;ll get a draw .
Mrs. BREEN : I don &apos;t know what &apos;s wrong with him lately .
I think he &apos;s been out in the sun too much .
father : not during school hours , I hope .
good evening , Patsy .
- Good evening , Father . - Sit down .
you &apos;re up a little late , aren &apos;t you ?
what &apos;s the matter ?
you in trouble ?
father , shouldn &apos;t I quit school and take a job ?
father : what can you do ?
you have to know something to do anything , you know .
you shouldn &apos;t get discouraged , Patsy .
I &apos;ve been watching your marks , and they &apos;re all right .
they &apos;re getting better .
Oh , Father , you &apos;re just being nice .
every time I think I know one thing ... then they ask me something else .
I &apos;m just a perfect blank .
guess I haven &apos;t got what it takes .
father : now don &apos;t ever think you &apos;re dumb .
all right , Father ... let &apos;s just say I &apos;m not very bright .
father : Hmm . what &apos;s the problem tonight ?
why are you up so late ?
it &apos;s an essay , Father .
father : &quot; the Five Senses . &quot; that &apos;s an interesting subject .
what have you discovered about them ?
nothing .
see what I mean ?
what are the five senses , Patsy ?
well , to see , to hear , to taste , to smell ... to feel .
father : that &apos;s right . who &apos;s the essay for ?
Patsy : sister Benedict .
Oh , we &apos;ll have to take dead aim on this one ... see if we can get you an &quot; A. &quot;
but you don &apos;t wanna be like your classmates .
they &apos;ll all come up with the same stereotyped answers .
we want to be different , be unique .
we &apos;ll write Sister an essay on another sense , huh ?
let &apos;s see .
man is endowed with ... certain powers which we call the five senses .
now , if he has common sense ... he &apos;ll get great happiness out of life ... by using these powers within right reason .
for instance , you &apos;re happy you came to St. Mary &apos;s , right ?
Yes , Father .
to be ... to be glad you &apos;re alive ... to be grateful because people are kind to you ... to be able to see some of nature &apos;s great wonders ... the budding of the flowers in spring ... the changing of leaves in the autumn ... to be able to appreciate beautiful music ... to be conscious of the beauty of tasting and feeling ... and hearing only the things that are good for you .
to be aware of why you &apos;re here .
Oh , I could go on and on and on , but ...
well , why don &apos;t you , Father ?
Hmmph .
I think I will .
&#91; singing &#93; Every time you &apos;re near a rose ... aren &apos;t you glad you &apos;ve got a nose ?
and if the dawn is fresh with dew ... aren &apos;t you glad you &apos;re you ?
when a meadowlark appears ... aren &apos;t you glad you &apos;ve got two ears ?
and if your heart is singing , too ... aren &apos;t you glad you &apos;re you ?
you can see a summer sky ... or touch a friendly hand ... or taste an apple pie .
pardon the grammar , but ain &apos;t life grand ?
and when you wake up each morn ... aren &apos;t you glad that you were born ?
think what you &apos;ve got the whole day through .
aren &apos;t you glad you &apos;re you ?
Patsy , I &apos;ll leave you with those few little thoughts .
what do you make of them ?
well , if you can &apos;t appreciate your five senses ... then your life isn &apos;t worth five cents .
that &apos;s good , good .
hope you do well tomorrow .
thank you , Father .
I feel much better .
I feel pretty good myself .
Benedict : now , children !
seems I can &apos;t leave you for a minute .
&quot; dear class , it &apos;s a holiday . &quot;
now , who did this ?
I must ask you again . who did this ?
now , children , I &apos;m putting you on your honor .
who did this ?
it &apos;s your duty to tell me .
father : good morning .
Benedict : we &apos;re honored with your visit , Father .
be seated , children .
won &apos;t you take my chair ?
we &apos;ll take this matter up later .
now we &apos;ll continue .
read what you &apos;ve written , so Father O &apos;Malley may hear it .
Luther .
father :
Luther ? how &apos;d he get in here ?
Benedict : we never knew .
&quot; the Five Senses .
&quot; I like to see a good movie ...
&quot; with Roy Rogers . &quot;
&#91; children GIGGLE &#93;
&quot; I like the taste of ice-cream cones ...
&quot; especially strawberry .
&quot; I like to listen to the Lone Ranger .
&quot; heigh-ho , Silver !
&quot; I like the smell of hot dogs at the ball park .
&quot; I like to feel good . &quot;
&#91; laughter &#93;
Benedict : don &apos;t laugh , children .
Luther means he wants to be a good boy .
you want to feel good in here , don &apos;t you , Luther ?
no , Sister .
I meant to feel good ... is like when the bell rings at 3 : 00 ... or when it &apos;s Easter vacation , better still .
that &apos;s how I meant to feel good .
Benedict : well , it has both honesty and imagination .
you can sit down .
and now , um , Patricia .
&quot; the Six Senses . &quot;
the subject I gave was the five senses .
well , I chose for my subject six senses .
well , go on , Patricia , go on .
&quot; the six senses ...
to see , to hear , to taste ...
&quot; to smell , to feel ...
&quot; to be .
&quot; and the most important is the last .
&quot; the sixth sense ...
&quot; is to be able to enjoy the five senses properly . &quot;
&quot; to be ...
that &apos;s what really matters .
&quot; it &apos;s a like world inside us , and we make what we may of it . &quot;
&quot; we see others , we hear others ...
&quot; we know others with our five senses ...
&quot; but how do we ever know ourselves ?
&quot; through common sense .
&quot; common sense is an internal sense ...
&quot; whose function it is to differentiate ...
&quot; between the various reports of the senses ...
&quot; or to reduce these reports ...
&quot; to the unity of a common perception . &quot;
two great words ... &quot; To be . &quot;
other words grow out of them ...
I am , you are , he is , we are , they are .
that sort of takes in everybody .
as Shakespeare said ...
&quot; to thine own self be true ...
&quot; and it shall follow , as the night the day ...
&quot; thou canst not then be false to any man . &quot;
and he was so right , Sister .
Oh , yes .
he was just talking about the sixth sense .
to put it in my own words ...
&quot; to be or not to be , that is the question . &quot;
very good , Patricia .
very good .
Patsy : and one more thing , Sister ...
&#91; bell RINGS &#93;
father : saved by the bell .
Benedict :
in the name of the Father ... and of the son and of the holy ghost , amen .
you may go now , children .
father : I really learned something .
Benedict :
Oh ? father : she shows a lot of promise .
Oh , definitely .
you giving her a &quot; B , &quot; perhaps ?
Oh , no . I think an &quot; A. &quot;
good . that &apos;s fine .
as a matter of fact , it should be maybe an &quot; A &quot; -plus , don &apos;t you , Father ?
that might be overdoing it a little .
it had a plus quality to it .
Yeah .
a girl like Patsy needs a lot of encouragement .
she has such a fine mind .
Yes . remarkable .
in fact , she has the mentality of a man your age .
there &apos;s another sense , you know , Sister ?
Oh , don &apos;t tell me .
Yeah . sense enough to know when to leave .
Eddie : good morning , Sister .
little Bobby wants to play with you .
children :
fight !
fight ! fight !
fight !
&#91; children CHEERING &#93;
children : Yay !
Eddie :
I &apos;m sorry I had to do that to you ... but if you &apos;re a good sport , we &apos;ll shake and be friends .
I &apos;ll even buy you an ice-cream cone .
- Two scoops ?
- Two scoops !
boy : Eddie , how did you learn to fight ?
second BOY : Yeah , how about that ?
sister .
you missed some excitement here .
I did ?
Yes , you did , uh ...
Yes , you did . Ahem .
it was quite a fight .
that little Eddie there ...
that is Eddie , isn &apos;t it ?
Oh , yes . Yes , that &apos;s Eddie .
the boy in that fight a while ago ?
Mm-hmm .
Yes .
quite a change .
it &apos;s incredible .
he &apos;s an improved man .
I wonder .
does it mean anything , Father ?
does it prove anything to beat up your fellow man ?
somehow , don &apos;t you think ... it &apos;s what we are in here that matters ?
I mean ...
I mean , to be .
you &apos;re so right .
Ahem .
but how do you account for such a sudden change ... in such a short time ?
Oh , we try to do our best to raise masculine little men ... with our limited knowledge of the outside world .
&#91; father AND BOYS SINGING ADESTE FIDELES &#93;
father : Yes , Sister ?
Benedict : I &apos;m sorry , Father , but you &apos;re disturbing us .
father : disturbing who ?
we &apos;re rehearsing a play and the children can &apos;t concentrate .
they &apos;re first graders , easily distracted .
we &apos;re making too much noise ?
to use your own words , yes , Father .
we heard about your play ... and we &apos;ve prepared a little surprise for you .
you can &apos;t have a Christmas play without Adeste Fideles .
Oh , yes .
you mean there &apos;s no room in your play ...
not in our play .
what ?
I &apos;d certainly like to see a play like that .
would you like to see a rehearsal ?
Yes . you kids stay here and practice awhile .
what are you going to use for music ?
Benedict : come and find out .
Benedict :
Bobby ! Bobby !
well , here &apos;s the little man I was telling you about .
father : Bobby &apos;s an old pal of mine .
you in the play , Bob ?
Bobby : Yes . I made it up .
father : I bet you &apos;ve got a good part .
Bobby : Yes . it &apos;s beautiful .
Benedict : can we see the play now , Bobby ?
Bobby : it &apos;s a little bit not good .
we &apos;re just practicing it .
it &apos;ll be better at Christmas .
Benedict : we won &apos;t mind a few mistakes .
father : no . what &apos;s it about ?
Bobby : that &apos;s what I tell you at the beginning .
father : why don &apos;t we begin ?
you ready ?
Benedict : the children have done this all by themselves .
every time the dialogue is different .
every line is a surprise to me .
heaven knows what it &apos;s going to be at Christmas .
father :
performing before their parents ... they &apos;ll probably forget everything .
this is Mary , and I &apos;m Joseph ... and we &apos;re going to Bethlehem ... to see if we can have someplace ... find someplace to stay .
and that &apos;s all you have to know , really .
- Knock knock . - Hello ?
Bobby : this is Mary , and I &apos;m Joseph .
we came to Bethlehem to find a place to stay .
Tim : do you have any money ?
Bobby : no , sir .
Tim : then you can &apos;t stay here tonight .
Bobby : well , that &apos;s too bad for us .
Mary , we can &apos;t stay there ... because we don &apos;t have any money .
DOROTHY : I &apos;ll be all right as long as I &apos;m with you .
Bobby : well , I think we ought to find a house ... because it might rain soon .
it &apos;s winter , you know .
DOROTHY : well , why don &apos;t you try next door ?
Bobby : good idea .
Bobby : knock knock knock knock .
George : can &apos;t stay here because you don &apos;t have any money .
Bobby : I didn &apos;t ask yet . go back inside again .
knock knock knock .
- Hello there .
- Hello .
this is Mary , and I &apos;m Joseph ... and could we ... could we ... stay here for the night ?
please ?
George : do you have any money ?
Bobby : no , but Mary &apos;s awfully tired .
could you think it over ?
George : ok .
DOROTHY : what did he say , Joseph ?
Bobby : he said he &apos;d think it over .
DOROTHY : well , when will he know ?
Bobby : I don &apos;t know .
George : Hey , Joseph , I thought it over .
you can stay in the stable .
Bobby : golly gee , did you hear that ?
DOROTHY : Yes , Joseph .
uh ... the next scene will be the Lord Jesus &apos; birthday .
&#91; SCRAPING &#93;
Bobby : you &apos;re supposed to lift it .
&#91; footsteps &#93;
no , no , Jimmy .
go back .
go on back . you &apos;re in the play .
his baby brother .
well , here we all are in the stables ... and we &apos;re very happy here in Bethlehem ... and there &apos;s our star .
here &apos;s our angel ... there are the shepherds ... and here are the wise men ... there , there , and there .
and , oh ... the neighbors are coming in ... bringing their presents because it &apos;s his birthday .
Bobby : thank you . you make Mary and I very happy .
now what , Bobby ?
you sing Holy Night , perhaps ?
Bobby : no , Father . we have another song .
Oh ?
how &apos;s it go ?
&#91; singing &#93; Happy birthday to you ...
happy birthday to you ...
happy birthday , dear Jesus ...
happy birthday to you .
Benedict : well , Father ?
father : Oh , their simplicity is beautiful .
I wouldn &apos;t change a word of it .
Benedict : but they will .
father : you won &apos;t be needing my talents at Christmas .
Benedict : no , Father .
father : maybe at Easter time I could stage an egg hunt .
Benedict : Mm-hmm .
Michael : look , Sister . there &apos;s Father O &apos;Malley .
I hope he finds him in a favorable mood .
he could be . it &apos;s spring , you know .
Bogardus : we &apos;re not getting anywhere , Father .
father :
it &apos;s a difficult decision , Mr. Bogardus ... to decide that there &apos;ll be no more St. Mary &apos;s .
Bogardus : if you ask me , it &apos;s not much now .
father : it is to the sisters .
to you , that school is just a piece of property ... but to them , well , it &apos;s everything .
it &apos;s not just selling you the property ... it &apos;s the thought of selling them out .
Bogardus : you &apos;re getting sentimental , aren &apos;t you ?
father : I &apos;ve been here long enough to know how they feel .
Bogardus : what about when it &apos;s condemned ?
father : they &apos;re expecting a miracle .
Bogardus : a miracle ?
what miracle will get them out of trouble ?
father : you &apos;d be surprised .
girls : Oh ! Oh , gee !
Benedict : no , Delphine , you &apos;re not doing it right .
Delphine : show me , Sister .
Benedict : you don &apos;t hold it right .
this is the way you should hold it .
and straight .
you chop it .
don &apos;t chop like that .
keep your hands together and step into it .
you see ?
Delphine : hit one , Sister . throw it .
Benedict : I don &apos;t think so . you better do it .
Yay !
Yay !
girls : Oh ! Aah !
doggone those kids !
there they go again !
father : here &apos;s your chance . they &apos;re coming to apologize .
ask them if they &apos;re willing to sell .
Bogardus : if it &apos;s all right with them ... it &apos;s all right with you ?
father :
I &apos;ll recommend it .
&apos;Course , you &apos;ll have to see the bishop .
he has the final word .
Bogardus : how &apos;s his business sense ?
father : you &apos;ll be glad to come to me ... and you &apos;ll have to .
I &apos;ll give you the letter to see the bishop ... but only after you &apos;ve straightened yourself out ... with the sisters .
good luck .
Oh , I &apos;ll never get this deal closed .
Benedict : is he very angry ?
father : I think you &apos;ll find him quite forgiving .
Benedict : you mean , for giving ?
Michael : would it be a good time to ask him , Father ?
father : never be any better .
Benedict : we are so sorry , Mr. Bogardus .
Bogardus : it &apos;s nothing , Sister . it &apos;s perfectly all right .
- We &apos;ll pay for it . - Don &apos;t think of it , Sister .
it &apos;s a little hard to get glass today , but I &apos;ll get it .
Benedict : it is a magnificent building .
Bogardus : thank you , Sister .
I know how you feel ... when I look at that tumbled-down school .
I have one problem , however ... before my dream is complete .
it &apos;s a parking problem .
you see , The Bogardus corporation ... will have several hundred employees ... and they all have cars .
parking &apos;s becoming more of a problem every day .
here &apos;s where my desk is going to be .
here are the blueprints .
it would take us years to raise the money ... to build a building like this .
Bogardus : Oh , you could never do it .
you &apos;d be surprised what it &apos;s cost me .
would you like to see the rest of my building ?
Oh , yes . by all means .
you just follow me .
Michael : shall we ask him now ?
Bogardus : ever see anything like this ?
Michael : it &apos;s tremendous , Mr. Bogardus .
Bogardus : 15,000 square feet without a column .
the balcony seats 400 .
we can hold dances here , conventions , everything .
it certainly is ideal .
it &apos;s perfect .
the Lord must have been the architect .
Bogardus : I wish he had been .
I had Butler and Deane , a couple of thieves .
robbed me right and left .
it cost me 30 % over the estimate .
Michael : but you must be happy with your accomplishment .
one thing could make me happier ... and you know that .
Benedict : I believe we &apos;re thinking about the same thing .
Bogardus : Yeah ?
Benedict : it isn &apos;t what we acquire in life , is it ?
it &apos;s what we give .
and this is a monument to you .
I can see the cornerstone reading ...
&quot; donated to St. Mary &apos;s ...
&quot; through the generosity ...
&quot; and benevolence of Horace P. Bogardus . &quot;
you &apos;re a very fortunate man , Mr. Bogardus .
I am ?
you know it &apos;s more blessed to give than to receive .
this will live long after you &apos;re dust .
now that is real happiness .
can &apos;t you just picture that ?
would you mind saying that again ?
picture what ?
when I &apos;m dust ?
you don &apos;t have to make up your mind right away .
why don &apos;t you sleep on it ?
I can &apos;t sleep now .
Benedict : you shouldn &apos;t be surprised .
sometimes we don &apos;t know why we do things .
you didn &apos;t know why you built this building .
Bogardus : I didn &apos;t ?
I thought I did .
Benedict : you built it in answer to our prayers .
Michael : we &apos;ve been praying and praying for this .
and we &apos;re going on praying .
Bogardus : do you mean to say you &apos;ve got the idea ...
we &apos;ll leave you now ... with this thought ...
&quot; donated to St. Mary &apos;s ...
&quot; through the generosity and benevolence ...
&quot; of Horace P. Bogardus . &quot;
generosity ... benevolence ... and dust .
I &apos;m sure that nice little man ... is going to give us his building .
we must keep on praying until ...
nun : God &apos;s will be done ?
and may God &apos;s will be our will .
nun : what if our prayers aren &apos;t answered ?
Benedict : Oh , thou of little faith .
we have reason to know ... more things are wrought by prayer ... than this world dreams of .
therefore , let thy voice ... rise like a fountain , night and day .
father : what &apos;s all the excitement ?
Notre Dame win another one ?
Benedict : no . I asked him .
- And ?
- He didn &apos;t say no .
so you finally got here .
been waiting for you fellas since 6 : 00 .
will you stop flying off the handle ? you &apos;re working too hard , Horace .
you ought to be in bed .
Bogardus :
with this building on my hands ?
should have been ready three months ago . you don &apos;t know how much money I &apos;m losing .
McKay :
if you &apos;re talking about money , see your banker . I &apos;m your doctor .
you can &apos;t go on like this , Horace .
you don &apos;t know what I &apos;m going through .
took me three weeks to get that glass . workman :
there you are . sign this . Bogardus :
what &apos;s this ? what &apos;s all this ?
workman : what &apos;s all what ?
sign it . Bogardus :
I want to know what I &apos;m signing .
workman :
we get overtime after 6 : 00 !
Bogardus :
you should &apos;ve been here before 6 : 00 .
I was . didn &apos;t even leave to go to my doctor &apos;s office .
one more crack , we &apos;ll take that glass back ... and it &apos;ll take you six weeks to get it put in .
sign it .
see what I &apos;m up against ?
- That &apos;s the way they do things . McKay : you mustn &apos;t let anything upset you .
Bogardus :
I know . McKay :
you &apos;re too big a man for that .
go home and get a good night &apos;s rest .
nothing can take the place of a good night &apos;s sleep . rest .
Tranquillity . relax .
a man in your position hasn &apos;t got a worry in the world . just keep saying ...
Bogardus : save it .
I won &apos;t feel it .
&#91; singing IN LATIN &#93;
now what &apos;s the matter ?
you don &apos;t know what they &apos;re doing to me .
I &apos;ll stop that .
what &apos;s the matter with you , Horace ? first , you &apos;re out of patience .
now you &apos;re out of glass .
and now you want me to sleep .
&#91; footsteps &#93;
what &apos;s new , Horace ? I heard the crash .
I wondered if anybody got hurt .
father O &apos;Malley , Dr. McKay , my physician . - How do you do , Doctor ?
- Glad to know you , Father .
father :
that &apos;s really too bad .
isn &apos;t glass hard to get these days ? Bogardus :
hard to get ?
I &apos;ll say it is .
can &apos;t you get them to stop that , Father ? McKay :
stop it , Horace ? it &apos;s beautiful .
his nerves are all shot .
it &apos;s hardly noticeable . what is that , Father ?
isn &apos;t that &quot; O Sanctissime &quot; ?
that &apos;s right , Doctor .
beautiful .
I &apos;ve heard it many times . how do the words go ?
&#91; father SINGING IN LATIN &#93;
do you know it , too ?
&#91; father SINGING IN LATIN &#93;
I want to go home . McKay :
now you &apos;re making sense .
he &apos;s had a big day , Father .
&#91; father SINGING IN LATIN &#93;
&#91; doorbell BUZZES &#93;
come in , Father .
- How are you , Mrs. Gallagher ? - Just fine .
father , I was wondering what &apos;s so important ... you couldn &apos;t tell me over the telephone ?
I don &apos;t know how to go about ...
- Is it about Patsy ?
what &apos;s happened , Father ?
what &apos;s she done ?
father :
it &apos;s not bad news .
in fact , this could be good news . Oh , I &apos;m so glad .
she &apos;s been getting along so well ...
if anything should upset her now ... FATHER : take it easy .
nothing has happened . Mrs. GALLAGHER :
you said it had something to do with Patsy . father : well , it has .
I found her father .
Joe ? well , I think so .
I told him the story as you told it to me .
I described you to him . how on earth did you run him down ?
once a piano player , always a piano player .
I got him through the Musician &apos;s Union . I went right to the top ...
Petrillo .
I really don &apos;t know what to say . father :
neither do I. MRS. GALLAGHER :
well , um ... is , uh , is he in town ?
he &apos;s out in the hall .
- Oh , no .
- Shall I bring him in ? Oh , no .
not ... That is ...
wait just a minute , will you ?
I , uh ... you know .
she &apos;ll be a few minutes .
she &apos;s fixing her hair , powdering her nose .
you know how it is .
father , this is , uh ... kind of a big moment for me .
mind you , it &apos;s 13 years .
I was a little bit younger then . father :
he hasn &apos;t exactly been on ice , you know .
well ...
well ... shall we ?
Hello .
Hello .
Good-bye . - Don &apos;t go yet , Father .
- Please stay a little while .
father : all right .
Mrs. GALLAGHER :
Joe , sit down .
you , too , Father . sit down a little while .
you haven &apos;t changed a bit .
neither have you , Joe .
do me a favor , will you ? Joe : what &apos;s that ?
Mrs. GALLAGHER :
play the piano . please .
I want Father to hear you .
I &apos;ve been telling him all about you . listen to this .
he &apos;s really good .
&#91; playing PIANO &#93;
what was that song we used to love so much ?
you mean &quot; By the Sea &quot; ?
no , Joe . no .
it ... it had a bit of the Rosary in it .
&#91; singing &#93; Hmm hmm hmm hmm . Hmm hmm hmm hmm .
Hmm hmm hmm hmm .
but that wasn &apos;t the melody .
Joe ...
don &apos;t you remember ?
we said that ... that no matter what happened ... that song would always see us through .
and then we pressed the rosebud in the book .
what happened ? Joe :
Yeah .
where &apos;s the book ?
Ahem .
do you know it ?
why , sure .
that &apos;s an old song called ...
&quot; in the Land of Beginning Again . &quot; Joe :
why didn &apos;t you say so ? father :
you never asked me . Mrs. GALLAGHER :
come on over here and get in , then . father : you &apos;ll be sorry .
&#91; singing &#93; There &apos;s a land of ...
beginning again .
where skies ...
are always blue .
though we &apos;ve made mistakes ...
that &apos;s true ...
let &apos;s forget the past ...
and start life anew .
though we &apos;ve wandered ...
by a river of tears ...
where sunshine ...
won &apos;t come through ...
let &apos;s find that paradise ...
where sorrow can &apos;t live ...
and learn the teachings ...
of forget and forgive ...
in the land of ...
beginning again ...
where broken dreams ...
come ...
true .
the girls are excited , aren &apos;t they , Sister ? Michael :
Yes . FITTER :
it reminds me of when I graduated . Michael :
it &apos;s a big moment in their lives .
it &apos;s the first time they &apos;re wearing high heels .
I &apos;m sure I &apos;ll get the hang of it .
look , Sister . Benedict :
Yes , that &apos;s really nice , Patsy . it &apos;s very ...
push the sleeve up a little bit like that .
it &apos;s a little long . Patsy :
it &apos;s supposed to be , Sister . Benedict :
Yes , but not ... Only on one side .
you don &apos;t want to stumble .
sister Benedict &apos;s giving Patsy all the attention . Benedict :
that isn &apos;t right .
- Patsy &apos;s teacher &apos;s pet . - Meow ! Delphine :
she is , too .
you gave her the prettiest dress . it would look better on me .
Benedict :
girls , I think that &apos;s about enough .
you better take your dresses off . girl :
I just got a funny idea .
suppose , after all this , I flunk ? Benedict :
I wouldn &apos;t worry .
- Would you do that to us ? - Oh , no .
girl :
it would be great to cut out the finals entirely .
you can &apos;t get around me that way . run along .
take your dresses off . be careful .
- Sister ?
- Yes , dear ? Patsy :
can I show this dress to my mother ? Benedict :
Yes . that would make her very happy . Patsy :
thank you , Sister . I know it will .
I &apos;ll get the tickets to Syracuse . - Good-bye , Joe .
- Good-bye , honey .
hold it !
would you like a stick of gum ?
I answered this one two ways , Sister .
Yes and no . - All right .
run along . - Thanks .
I &apos;m sorry , Patsy .
time is up .
may I come in ? don &apos;t get up .
I &apos;m just the pastor .
Grading the papers , I see .
Benedict :
Yes , Father . father :
they &apos;re a wonderful bunch of children .
you should be very proud of them . Benedict :
we are . father :
I ran into some of the girls .
they &apos;re dying with curiosity about their marks .
I &apos;m supposed to come in and without your knowing ... find out how they turned out .
I presume you opened your heart and passed them all ? Benedict :
all but one , Father .
Patsy ?
Oh , no .
well , this is only one subject .
the others are even worse . her average is below 60 .
she got the date and her name right .
couldn &apos;t she get something on that ?
add it up again , maybe pass her ?
don &apos;t you think the honor of the school means anything ?
but what about Patsy ?
St. Mary &apos;s isn &apos;t being very much help to her .
don &apos;t you think we should help a child like that ?
she &apos;s beginning to believe in herself .
a blow like this , the child may never get over it .
do you believe in just passing everybody , Father ?
maybe .
maybe I do .
Benedict : I can &apos;t believe you mean it . father :
it &apos;s easier for some children to make the grade .
they don &apos;t have to study .
some have the best marks in school ... and never made much of a mark afterward .
I knew a character once ... a fellow named Elmer Hathaway .
he and I went through school together .
or rather , I went through school .
Elmer just stood still .
I think he was three years in the eighth grade .
he was quite a boy .
the teacher often wondered how he found his way to school .
sometimes he didn &apos;t .
kids used to make fun of him .
he was sort of a dreamer .
sometimes he &apos;d forget what day it was ... and he &apos;d come to school on Saturday .
asked him who Plato was , and he said , &quot; Plato who ? &quot;
but he was good with his hands .
he built a boat ... a sailboat .
one time he disappeared for two , three days .
when he came back ... they asked him where he &apos;d been ... and he said , &quot; Oh , just sailing . &quot;
he got to be about a foot taller ... than anybody in the class .
they felt sorry for him , so they decided to pass him .
besides , I think they needed the desk at the time .
he never knew about it .
from that time on , he developed assurance .
you &apos;ve heard of Hathaway Shipyards , haven &apos;t you ? - Yes .
- That &apos;s Elmer .
and to this day , he cares for his less fortunate pals ... the ones who used to get 99 and 100 .
if any of them are broke or out of a job ... they can always work for Hathaway .
he &apos;s a good man .
by the way ... just what is passing anyhow ?
Benedict : 75 , you know . father :
Yes , I know , but who started it ? Benedict :
our school is based on it .
if we don &apos;t have standards ... FATHER :
Yes ? Benedict :
but certainly you &apos;re not serious ? father :
I am .
aren &apos;t we here to help the children ... or are we here to measure their brains with a yardstick ?
why do they have to have 75 to pass ?
- You &apos;d put the standard at 65 ?
- Why not ? Benedict :
then why not at 55 ? why any grades at all ?
why not let them run wild ?
better than breaking their hearts .
that &apos;s unfair , Father .
my heart aches for Patsy ... and what you infer , you &apos;re being very unjust .
realize I &apos;ve done everything possible to help her ... but I must uphold our standards .
if you order me to pass her ...
I shall do so .
but her mark remains the same .
come in , Patsy .
thank you , Sister .
- Hello , Father . - Patsy . Patsy :
I failed , didn &apos;t I , Sister ?
Benedict :
Yes , you did , Patsy . Patsy :
that &apos;s what I thought . Benedict :
I &apos;m sorry . Patsy :
well , that &apos;s all right , Sister .
it wasn &apos;t your fault . I was ...
I was just thinking ...
I won &apos;t be needing this now , and ... well , Delphine liked it so much .
I was just thinking that , um ...
I was just thinking ... that maybe I &apos;ll do better next year , Sister .
sister , you and I ... have had our differences of opinion ... but they haven &apos;t been important .
this is serious .
I &apos;m not ordering you to do anything .
it &apos;s up to you , but ...
but she failed .
father : Hooray , Luther !
give him a hand , fellas .
who &apos;s next ?
watch yourself , Bruce .
I &apos;ll be right back .
I &apos;ll go with Sister .
father : what &apos;s happened ? Michael :
sister Benedict &apos;s ill . she fainted in the chapel . father :
did you call a doctor ?
- She doesn &apos;t want one . - Oh , she doesn &apos;t , huh ?
&#91; knock ON DOOR &#93; BENEDICT :
come in . father :
doctor &apos;s on his way .
how you feeling , Sister ?
Benedict : who sent for a doctor ? father :
she did . Michael :
you can &apos;t trust him . he &apos;s an informer . father :
how are you feeling , Sister ? Benedict :
I feel all right . won &apos;t you sit down ?
I want to talk to you . please excuse us .
father : what have I done now ? Benedict :
you &apos;ve been writing .
you &apos;ve been writing to Mother General . father :
Oh ? Benedict :
going over my head .
Yes , I received that letter from her . father :
I just wrote expressing my own opinion , Sister .
but I hope that hasn &apos;t brought this on .
no . no , I ...
I &apos;m just tired .
but you actually considered tearing down St. Mary &apos;s and sending our children to St. Victor &apos;s ?
that &apos;s right . I thought about it quite a bit .
we have to face facts , Sister .
Yes .
Yes , I know what you mean , Father .
we &apos;ve tried so hard ... not to face facts .
but there ... there must always be a St. Mary &apos;s .
father : of course , Sister .
now , just relax . take it easy .
pardon me , but the doctor &apos;s ... FATHER :
come in , Doctor . - Hello , Father .
- This is Dr. McKay , Sister .
- Hello , Doctor . - Hello , Sister . father :
he &apos;s Mr. Bogardus &apos; doctor , you know .
Oh , yes ?
are you his personal physician ? McKay :
Yes .
I have other patients ... possibly a hundred or so ... and Horace P. Bogardus .
lately , he &apos;s been a full-time job .
rings me up all hours of the night . Benedict :
we pray for him all the time .
that &apos;s very nice . he certainly could use it .
may I ask why ? father :
they need a new school .
they &apos;re praying for him to give them his building . McKay :
give ?
Bogardus ?
pardon me . father :
it &apos;s all right . I have a sense of humor . McKay :
maybe your prayers are having some effect .
he can &apos;t sleep nights . I &apos;m giving him sleeping tablets .
prayer &apos;s a wonderful thing ... but if Bogardus ever gives you that building , I &apos;ll ...
father : bup , bup . nothing spectacular , Doctor .
McKay : ok .
well , I can &apos;t do much here .
if you &apos;re able tomorrow , come in for a checkup . Benedict :
nothing &apos;s wrong . I &apos;m just tired .
I know , but you let me be the judge of that .
I want to know the cause of your being tired . - But I ...
- She &apos;ll be there , Doctor .
keep right on praying , Sister , but not tonight .
you need a good night &apos;s rest . father :
so does Bogardus . McKay :
Yes , that &apos;s right . ha ha .
you heard what the man said .
you take it easy .
you won &apos;t forget , Father ?
you &apos;ll see she gets to the office tomorrow ? father :
she has a mind of her own ... but I &apos;ll get her down there .
this anything serious ? McKay :
she &apos;s running a little temperature .
she &apos;s had these attacks before ? father :
that &apos;s what I heard today .
I hope it &apos;s nothing serious . she &apos;s such a remarkable woman . McKay :
I could tell that when I walked into the room .
does she really believe ... that Bogardus is going to give that building ?
father : Yes .
well , I &apos;ve heard of such things ... but I &apos;ve never come across it before ... not since I was a little boy ... and wished for what I wanted for Christmas and got it .
father :
it &apos;s sort of the same thing . McKay :
but when we grow up , we get practical .
she &apos;s not very practical , is she ? father :
she thinks she is . McKay :
what &apos;ll she do when she doesn &apos;t get ... FATHER :
you see ? now she &apos;s got you worried . McKay :
Yes , she has . I hate to see her disillusioned .
not to change the subject ... much ... but Bogardus has a bad heart , doesn &apos;t he ?
McKay : Yes . father :
what are you giving him for it , pills ? McKay :
have you got a better prescription ? father :
well , I knew a fellow once .
he had a very bad heart .
in fact , they only gave him six months to live .
but he spent that six months doing so much good ... do you know he lived to be 90 ?
McKay : that so ?
you mean doing good for others ... is good for a bad heart ?
don &apos;t you spend your life doing good for others ? McKay :
Yes ... yes .
- How &apos;s your heart ? - Fine .
father :
there you are . McKay :
are you tampering with the laws of medicine ? father :
we have a lot in common .
we &apos;re both interested in the good heart . McKay :
your suggestion is that I change my prescription ? father :
you &apos;re the doctor . McKay :
I &apos;m not so sure , O &apos;Malley .
- Good day . - Good day .
father : Mr. Bogardus .
father O &apos;Malley . Bogardus :
Oh , yes , Father . excuse me . I didn &apos;t see you .
father : you seemed to be looking right past me . Bogardus :
my mind was miles away .
Yes , you don &apos;t seem to be yourself today .
I &apos;m not , Father .
I &apos;ve just come from my doctor .
you know , Father ... if I had to live my life over again ... there &apos;d be a lot of changes made .
father : Yeah ? Bogardus :
Yeah , a lot of changes .
you know , there &apos;s great beauty in this world ... if you just have the eyes to see it , isn &apos;t there ?
Oh , naturally .
Oh .
thank you .
Bogardus : Ah , yes , life can be very beautiful . father :
that &apos;s right .
father , you &apos;ve spent your whole life ... doing things for people .
- No , I ...
- Oh , yes , you have .
come to think of it , Father , how &apos;s your heart ?
great , great .
that &apos;s what I mean .
would it be all right , Father , if I go into the church ?
you &apos;re perfectly welcome . there it is .
and here &apos;s a thought that might help you .
it &apos;s meant a lot to me .
I shall pass this way but once .
if there &apos;s any good I can do for anyone ... let me do it now and not put it off ... for I shall not pass this way again .
Oh , thank you , Father .
God bless you .
thank you , Father . father :
Good-bye .

Oh , wait , wait .

- Thank you . - Thank you .
Bogardus : it &apos;s a beautiful world , isn &apos;t it ? father :
you pretty near left it there . Bogardus :
I nearly did . I &apos;ll get off to church .

&#91; whining &#93;
Benedict : Mr. Bogardus . Bogardus :
I &apos;m sorry about this , Sister .
I didn &apos;t realize he &apos;d followed me to the church .
sweet little fellow , isn &apos;t he ?
Benedict : that &apos;s quite all right .
bring him anytime .
I mean , it doesn &apos;t matter .
I see that animals love you .
Bogardus : Oh , yes , but people don &apos;t . Benedict :
you must be wrong .
I &apos;m sure when people get to know you , they love you .
Bogardus : no , no . that &apos;s when they don &apos;t .
- You see , Sister ...
- Yes , Mr. Bogardus ?
I &apos;ve never had any children of my own .
and I &apos;ve never even liked children .
and they don &apos;t like me .
why don &apos;t people like you ?
well , I &apos;ve been very selfish .
and lately , I &apos;ve been giving it a lot of thought .
come to any conclusion ?
Yes .
this is going to surprise you .
and I do want people to like me ... so ...
I was wondering ... if you would accept ...
my building .
Oh !
what &apos;s the matter ?
Bogardus : it &apos;s a bit of a shock to you ?
Yes ... yes .
well , you can have it .
I &apos;ll go straight to my lawyer ... and have him make out the deeds right away .
Benedict : thank you , Mr. Bogardus !
St. Mary &apos;s won &apos;t forget it , and the children will love you .
Bogardus : I &apos;ll have the papers made out right away .
come on , doggy .
come on , come on .

woman : Aah ! Aah !
what happened ? man :
all right , back it away , back it away .
what &apos;s the big idea ?
Bogardus : I don &apos;t need any help .
Benedict : Mr. Bogardus , how are you ?
- I &apos;m all right ! - And your legs ?
ok .
no bones broken .
&#91; sister BENEDICT SINGING IN SWEDISH &#93;
&#91; singing IN SWEDISH &#93;
Oh , Father O &apos;Malley .
father : well , Sister , that was lovely .
what is it called ?
Benedict : it means , uh ...
&quot; it &apos;s spring . &quot;
father : don &apos;t let me stop you . sing something else .
Benedict : what do we know ?
how about , uh ...
do you know &quot; Birmingham Bertha &quot; ?
nuns : no .
father : how about the school song then ?
Michael : sister has a new version of it .
- She &apos;s proud of it . - Well , sing that .
Benedict : won &apos;t you sing the melody , Father ? father :
sister , you talked me into it .
nuns : &#91; singing &#93; Ding dong .
Ding dong .
Ding dong .
Ding .
Oh , bells of St. Mary &apos;s ...
we always will love you .
with your inspiration ...
we never will fail .
your chimes will forever ...
bring sweet mem &apos;ries of you .
so proudly ring out ...
while we sing out ...
hail , hail , hail !
so proudly ring out ...
while we sing out ...
hail ...
hail .
Ding dong .
Ding .
won &apos;t you ring dem bells ?
father : haven &apos;t had a chance like that in years .
I had to try it .
- Father . - Yes ?
- The doctor &apos;s here . - Oh , good .
- How are you , Father ?
- Hello , Doctor .
McKay : sister Benedict was in to see me .
father : she &apos;s in great spirits , the happiest person alive .
isn &apos;t it wonderful what faith can do ?
McKay : everyone &apos;s so happy around here ...
I hate to be the bearer of bad news .
I examined Sister Benedict .
can she be sent away for a while ?
father : why ? where ?
McKay : some place like Arizona , for instance ?
you see this area here ?
- Yes , why ?
- That &apos;s the right lung .
McKay : and here , in this area ...
father : I never could make out those things .
what is it , Doctor , TB ?
Yes .
a very early stage .
McKay : it &apos;s not that bad .
we &apos;re lucky to catch it right now .
that &apos;s why I asked if she could be sent ... to a drier climate ... to an infirmary or a home for old people ... some place where she could have light duties ... not another school .
if it has to be done , I guess it can be done , but ... not to be with children ...
McKay :
not for a while .
not until this condition &apos;s cleared up .
father : does she know about this ?
not yet . it &apos;s very important that she doesn &apos;t know it .
she has a wonderful vitality , a natural optimism ... and that &apos;s the best medicine anyone can have .
if that spirit is dampened ... it would have a depressing effect and delay her recovery .
father : she &apos;ll have to know about it .
we can &apos;t just send her away .
don &apos;t you people go where you &apos;re told without question ?
Yes , and we &apos;re supposed to have ... the stamina to take it .
McKay : she has plenty of that .
but you don &apos;t quite understand , Doctor .
you see ...
sister and I haven &apos;t always agreed ... on how to run the school .
it &apos;s about one rather serious difference of opinion .
now , if she &apos;s sent away without any explanation , why ... she &apos;s bound to think that ...
up to here , Father , we were discussing her health ... what &apos;s best for her .
now we &apos;re discussing your feelings .
it &apos;s a heck of a way to put it .
McKay : I only want to see her get well .
I guess I can see to it that she &apos;s transferred , but ... not to tell her why ... send her away without any explanation ...
you would put it that way .
her opinion of me or her health .
Benedict : right down here , men .
there .
all right .
just straighten it a little bit .
there , that &apos;s ...
Yes , that &apos;s right . thank you .
this is ... -
go up there .
there .
be sure to leave room for their knees .
you know how they go . you remember .
- Good morning , Father .
- Morning , Sister .
Benedict : look out , Father , you &apos;re in the way .
father : here , let me help you with that .
Benedict : there .
just put it down there .
I &apos;m glad you &apos;re here . there &apos;s lots on my mind .
father : I want to talk to you , too .
Benedict : when you bring the desk , put it over here .
workman : Yes , Sister .
Benedict : let &apos;s go where there &apos;s less noise .
now we can finally tear down our old school ... and that can become our playground .
it &apos;s all so wonderful . and I &apos;m tired .
I &apos;ll sit down for a minute .
father : working too hard . you shouldn &apos;t be lifting things .
Benedict : it must be all the excitement .
what was I going to say ?
Yes , about commencement . did you ask Mr. Bogardus ?
- Yes , and the doctor .
- Fine . he &apos;s a nice man .
he telephoned and said I had nothing to worry about .
I &apos;ll have you know he said there &apos;s nothing wrong with me .
I &apos;m perfect .
that is good news .
Benedict : Yes , isn &apos;t it ?
do you want me to thank Bogardus publicly ?
Oh , yes , by all means ... and convey our sincere gratitude ... for his wholehearted generosity .
but don &apos;t make a long speech .
I &apos;ll be the soul of brevity .
the children will be restless ... and the parents will be interested only in them .
but impress upon the graduating class ... that they must never give up their pursuit of learning ... and at all times carry uppermost in their minds ... the ideals of St. Mary &apos;s .
Yes , I think that &apos;ll take care of everything , Father .
if you think I &apos;ll be long-winded ... why don &apos;t you write the speech ?
I have , Father .
I have it here .
and I have one more wish ... that the next year will be a joyous and successful one ... and that we &apos;ll never have any more misunderstandings .
serious ones , I mean .
Benedict : I know how you feel about Patsy .
you still disagree with me , don &apos;t you ?
father ... sometimes we have to do things that aren &apos;t easy .
no matter how much they hurt us ... we have to do what we believe is right .
I have something to tell you , Sister ... that isn &apos;t going to be easy .
what is that , Father ?
you &apos;ll be notified shortly ... that Sister Michael is going to be in charge next year .
Oh , she ...
she &apos;ll be so happy .
and I ?
will ... will I ...
it &apos;s only fair to tell you , Sister ... that you &apos;re being transferred .
it &apos;s going to be difficult to leave St. Mary &apos;s .
but we shouldn &apos;t become too attached to any one place .
any other school may seem strange at first ... but as long as I &apos;m around children ...
I &apos;ll be happy .
how do you know all this ?
have you been writing Mother General again ?
will I be here for graduation ?
Yes , Sister , of course .
workman : is this the desk that goes in your office , Sister ?
Benedict : Yes .
Yes .
was there anything else you had to say , Father ?
that was all ?
father : Yes , Sister .
Benedict : I &apos;ll go with you .
Delphine : sorry you couldn &apos;t be with us , Pat .
Patsy : thanks , Del .
what happened to my dress ?
Delphine : sister has it . it didn &apos;t fit me .
too many milk shakes .
Delphine : well , better luck next year .
I &apos;ll be rooting for you .
thanks .
Joe : where is she ?
which one &apos;s Patsy ?
Mrs. GALLAGHER : I ... I don &apos;t see her .
I &apos;ll look for her .
you go find Father O &apos;Malley .
Joe : ok .
who is that ?
my mother , Sister .
is she here for the exercises ?
I guess so .
you didn &apos;t tell her you &apos;re not graduating ?
no , Sister .
my dear child , why not ?
she &apos;s been out of town .
it &apos;s embarrassing , Patsy , I know ... but you mustn &apos;t feel so badly about not graduating .
if we don &apos;t fail sometimes ... our successes won &apos;t mean anything .
you must have courage .
don &apos;t give up .
I &apos;ll explain to your mother , so she won &apos;t think ill of you .
I know she loves you , and you love her ... and where there &apos;s love , there &apos;s understanding .
if you ask me , nobody understands anything .
you don &apos;t understand anything ...
father O &apos;Malley doesn &apos;t understand anything ... my mama does ...
Oh , Sister , I &apos;m sorry .
Benedict : what is troubling you , Patsy ?
Oh , Sister , help me .
Oh , please help me .
Yes , of course .
of course I want to help you .
Patsy : I want to be a nun , Sister .
how can I become a nun like you ?
there &apos;s one thing I do know ...
something is troubling you .
Patsy : no . I just want to be a nun .
you don &apos;t say it that way , my dear .
&quot; I want to be a nun . &quot;
you don &apos;t become a nun to run away from life , Patsy .
it &apos;s not because you &apos;ve lost something .
it &apos;s because you &apos;ve found something .
you &apos;re still a little girl .
you don &apos;t know yet .
Oh , but I do .
I just want to be like you .
you don &apos;t know what the next four years will bring .
you haven &apos;t been to high school yet .
those are years you &apos;ll always treasure .
new companions , new interests ... lots of fun ... as well as study .
going to parties .
football games .
your first prom .
your first party dress .
your first waltz .
you can &apos;t give up these things if you know nothing about them .
not until you &apos;ve known all this ... and more ... can you say with complete understanding ...
&quot; I want to be a nun . &quot;
Oh , but I can . I can !
I know them all now .
well , then , Patsy , that &apos;s another thing .
your marks aren &apos;t good enough .
you have to pass your examinations .
but I could have .
I could have passed .
I didn &apos;t want to .
you mean you failed on purpose ?
I thought I could stay here another year .
everything &apos;s so nice here , Sister .
you don &apos;t know .
everything &apos;s so clean ... and so good and ... even if I am in the same grade ...
I don &apos;t care .
I &apos;d be with you .
Oh , Patsy .
I &apos;m beginning to see what &apos;s wrong .
did Father O &apos;Malley know about this ?
nobody knows , Sister .
nobody but me .
&quot; I. &quot;
no , Sister , you &apos;re wrong .
&quot; but &quot; can be used as a preposition ... as well as a conjunction ... and then it takes the objective case .
that was on the examination , wasn &apos;t it ?
Uh-huh . and I missed it .
I &apos;m brighter than you think I am .
ask me more questions .
I wouldn &apos;t be a dumb nun .
Oh , Patsy .
father : sister , this is Mr. And Mrs. Joe Gallagher .
Patsy &apos;s mother and father .
Benedict : how do you do ?
O &apos;MALLEY : Patsy , your father .
Joe : Hello , Patsy .
don &apos;t look at me like that , Patsy .
give me time .
I may grow on you .
mother : darling , don &apos;t cry .
everything &apos;s going to be different from now on .
mommy and daddy are going to see that you have a home ... a real home ... and have a room all your own .
you can have children over ... as often as you like .
you ...
well , you ...
you won &apos;t be lonely anymore .
Patsy : Oh , mama !
Oh , mama !
is this my real daddy ?
mother : Yes , darling .
Yes .
Joe : we came to see you graduate .
isn &apos;t it time you were getting ready ?
we were just about to get ready ... weren &apos;t we , Patsy ?
Patsy : Yes , Sister .
Mrs. GALLAGHER : how were her marks , Father ?
I didn &apos;t see her report card .
father : her marks ? they were exceptional .
there wasn &apos;t a child in the class anywhere near her .
Mrs. GALLAGHER :
&#91; pomp AND CIRCUMSTANCE PLAYS &#93;
this is indeed a great day for St. Mary &apos;s ... the first birthday of the new St. Mary &apos;s .
there &apos;s the old , here &apos;s the new .
we owe it all to the generosity and benevolence of one man ... a man whose name will be graven ... on our cornerstone and in our hearts ... for many years to come .
speaking of hearts ... a truly great heart beats in the bosom ... of Mr. Horace P. Bogardus .
&#91; applause &#93;
Mr. Bogardus is a very modest man .
when you have a heart that loves children ... that thinks only of others ... that &apos;s capable of doing so much good ... then you have a heart ... that can laugh at the years .
&#91; applause &#93;
Mr. Bogardus is a fine example ... of the joy of giving .
to him , every day is Christmas .
indeed , he has holly in his heart .
&#91; applause &#93;
girl : thank you .
St. Mary &apos;s is founded on faith , hope , and charity .
the greatest of these is charity .
Bogardus : a gift to the church is deductible .
father : so thank Mr. Bogardus for his generous gift .
now I &apos;d like to say a few words ... to the boys and girls of our graduating class .
I &apos;ll make it very brief .
today is a joyous one for you because you &apos;re graduating .
it &apos;s also a sad one because you &apos;re leaving St. Mary &apos;s .
I can &apos;t sum up in a few minutes ... what you &apos;ve learned in eight years .
what you &apos;re taking with you ... isn &apos;t just what &apos;s in the books .
that &apos;s important , but it isn &apos;t everything .
what you &apos;re taking with you ... is what you have to give to others ... what the good sisters have taught you .
if any of you are ever in trouble ... no matter what ... you just dial &quot; O &quot; ... for O &apos;Malley .
&#91; applause &#93;
Michael : did you order the cab ?
father : Yes . it will be waiting outside .
sister Benedict in the chapel ?
why ?
dear Lord ...
dear Lord ... remove all bitterness from my heart .
please ... help me to see thy holy will ... in all things .
help me .
please .
Oh , please help me .
Benedict : are you going with me , Sister Angela ?
Angela : Yes , Sister .
first SISTER :
Good-bye , Sister . Benedict :
Good-bye . second SISTER : Good-bye , Sister .
Benedict :
Good-bye . - Good-bye , Sister . - Good-bye , Sister .
Benedict : Good-bye , Sister Genevieve .
you know that wherever I am ... my heart will always be with St. Mary &apos;s .
Michael : Good-bye , Sister Benedict .
Benedict : Good-bye , Sister Michael .
father ...
father : sister , we know your heart will be here .
we &apos;ll always remember you in our prayers .
thank you .
- Good-bye , Father .
sister ?
sister Benedict ?
sister , I can &apos;t let you go like this .
you know , when Dr. McKay said you were perfect ... he was right ... for that &apos;s what you are .
but he didn &apos;t mean physically ... because , Sister ... you have a touch of tuberculosis .
Oh , Dr. McKay felt that ... you shouldn &apos;t know about this , but I fe ...
thank you , Father .
thank you .
you &apos;ve made me very happy .
I &apos;ll get well quickly now .
of course you will , Sister ... and if you ever need anything , no matter what it is ... or wherever you happen to be ...
Yes .
I know .
I &apos;ll just dial &quot; O &quot; for O &apos;Malley .
right .

- Want anything else ?
- No .
Hey , you !
- Me ?
- Yeah you .

East .
too bad . I thought if you was heading north I might be able to help you out .
I &apos;m pushing myself late tonight . I don &apos;t like to ride alone at night .
I am one of those guys who gotta talk or I fall asleep .
my partner , he &apos;s got Lou to keep him company , but I ain &apos;t got nobody at all .
- Where &apos;re you coming from ?
- West .
Yeah sure , I know , but where ?
la ?
- Maybe .
- I &apos;ve got a cousin out in LA ...
- You don &apos;t say .
- Yeah . he &apos;s been out ...
you &apos;re not much of a talker , are you ?
my mother taught me never to speak to strangers .
- Oh , wise guy is it .
- So what !
?
okay , okay . don &apos;t get sore .
trying to be sociable . that &apos;s all .
Hey , Grandma !
give me change for a dime , will you ? .
let &apos;s have something quieter this time , Joe . my head &apos;s splitting .

Hey , turn that off .

- What &apos;s eating you now ?
- Yeah , what &apos;s eating you ?
- That music , it stinks .
- Oh , you don &apos;t like it , huh ?
- No . turn it off !
- Now wait a minute , pal .
that was mine , that penny .
this is a free country , and I play whatever I want to .
ok .
sure , and if you don &apos;t like it , you don &apos;t have to listen to it .
and you can leave here any time , you want to .
ok OK . I &apos;m sorry I am .
first good piece played tonight , and you don &apos;t like it .
some people just ain &apos;t got any good taste .
that tune ...
that tune ...
why was it always that rotten tune ?
following me around , beating in my head , never letting up .
did you ever want to forget anything ?
did you ever want cut away a piece of your memory or blot it out ?
you can &apos;t , you know .
no matter how hard you try .
you can change the scenery but sooner or later , you &apos;ll get a whiff of perfume or somebody will say a certain phrase , or maybe hum something and you &apos;re licked again .
&quot; I can &apos;t believe that you &apos;re in love with me &quot;
I used to love that song , once .
so did the customers back in the old Break O &apos; Dawn Club in New York .
I can &apos;t remember a night when I didn &apos;t get at least 3 requests for it .
Sue ...
she was always was selling it too .
those were the days .
your eyes of blue , your kisses too
I never knew what they could do
I can &apos;t believe that you &apos;re in love with me
you &apos;re telling everyone I know
that I &apos;m on your mind each place you go
they can &apos;t believe that you &apos;re in love with me .
I have always placed you far above me
I just can &apos;t imagine that you love me
and after all is said and done
to think that I &apos;m the lucky one
I can &apos;t believe that you &apos;re in love with me .
it wasn &apos;t much of a club , really . you know the kind .
a joint where you could have a sandwich and a few drinks and run interference for your girl on the dance floor .
I fronted the piano in there every night from 8 : 00 until the place closed up which usually meant 4 : 00 in the morning .
a good job , as jobs went in those days .
and then too there was Sue .
... who made working there a little like working in heaven .
but how we felt about each other . well , there was nothing very unusual in that .
I was an ordinary healthy guy , and she was an ordinary healthy girl .
and when you add those two together , you get an ordinary healthy romance .
which is the old story sure , but somehow the most wonderful thing in the world .
all in all , I was a pretty lucky guy .
Mr Paderewsky , I presume ...
it &apos;s beautiful .
you &apos;re going to make Carnegie Hall your door .
Yeah , as a janitor .
I &apos;ll make my debut in the basement .
I don &apos;t blame you for being bitter , darling but you mustn &apos;t give up hope .
- Why , some day ...
- Yeah , some day if I don &apos;t get arthritis first .
in the meantime , let &apos;s blow this trap .
- Like to get something to eat , hon &apos; ?
- I don &apos;t think so , Al . I lose my appetite working in this fleabag .
- Let &apos;s go home .
- OK .
I can &apos;t stand much more of that dump .
did you see that drunk tonight trying to paw me .
no , what drunk ?
it doesn &apos;t matter what drunk !
say , what &apos;s the matter with you tonight , darling ?
that &apos;s the third time you started to tell me something and then stopped .
we shouldn &apos;t have any secrets from each other , Sue .
next week , we &apos;re going to make with the ring and the license . you and me . we &apos;ll be a team .
Yes , that &apos;s right . in the Bush League .
- I don &apos;t get you .
- We &apos;ve been struck out .
a funny way to talk , darling .
- Don &apos;t you want to marry me ?
- Al , look , I love you , you know I do .
- And I want to marry you .
- But ...
but not now .
only after we do good .
someday , I &apos;m going away .
Oh , I know you &apos;ll think it silly ...
that &apos;s why I hesitated to tell you . but I &apos;m going to California ...
I want to try my luck in Hollywood .
that &apos;s the most stupid thing , I ever heard of .
don &apos;t you know millions of people go out there every year and wind up polishing cuspidors ?
I thought you had better sense .
you sound as if you don &apos;t think I have any talent .
that has nothing to do with it .
- I &apos;ll make out alright .
- Maybe . but what about me ?
doesn &apos;t it mean anything to you that you &apos;re busting up all our plans .
- We may not see each other for years .
- It won &apos;t be that long .
- I thought you loved me .
- I do , you know I do .
well ... here we are .
Al ...
Al , why can &apos;t you see my side of it ?
I &apos;m young . we both are .
and we &apos;ve got all the time in the world to settle down .
really , darling what I &apos;m doing is the only sane thing to do .
I ...
I hate the thought of being so far away from you , but ...
but we &apos;ll be together again someday .
maybe you &apos;ll decide to come out too , later on .
so long .
Al ...
aren &apos;t you going to kiss me goodnight ?
sure , why not ?
good night .
say Roberts , you hit the jackpot this time ...
ten bucks .
thanks .
but when a drunk handed me a ten spot , after a request I couldn &apos;t get very excited .
what was it ? I asked myself .
a piece of paper crawling with germs .
it couldn &apos;t buy anything I wanted . it couldn &apos;t ...
then I thought of something .
long distance . I &apos;d like to put a call through to Los Angeles .
Miss Harvey , Sue Harvey .
H-A-R-V-E-Y .
the number is :
Crest View 65723 .
fifty ... seventy five ... eighty five .
Hello Sue ?
this is Al .
Oh baby , it &apos;s great to hear from you too .
what &apos;s that ?
you do ? Oh , me too , darling .
I thought I &apos;d go batty without you . I just had to ...
huh ?
...
you &apos;re working as a hash slinger ?
gee honey , that &apos;s tough .
those guys out in Hollywood don &apos;t know the real thing when it &apos;s right in front of them .
you just stick it out too , baby .
keep going around to those casting offices . I &apos;m sure you &apos;ll click .
look , I &apos;ll tell you what . you stay put out there . I &apos;ll come to you .
no , do not try to stop me . just expect me .
train ?
who knows . train , plane , bus , magic carpet . I &apos;ll be there if I have to crawl .
if I have to travel by pogo stick .
and then let &apos;s get married right away , huh ?
that &apos;s the stuff .
that &apos;s what I &apos;ve been wanting to hear you say .
well ... goodbye for now .
I &apos;ll be seeing you soon .
Yeah .
&apos;Bye .
the only way I could cross country was to thumb rides .
for even after hawking everything , I only had enough money to eat .
money . you know what that is .
the stuff you never have enough of .
little green things with George Washington &apos;s picture that men slave for commit crimes for , die for .
it &apos;s the stuff that has caused more trouble in the world than anything else we ever invented .
simply because , there &apos;s too little of it .
at least , I had too little of it .
so it was me for the thumb .
ever done any hitchhiking ?
it &apos;s not much fun , believe me .
Oh yeah , I know all about how it &apos;s an education how to get to meet a lot of people and all that .
but me from now on , I &apos;ll take my education in college , or in PS-62 , or I &apos;ll send $ 1.98 in stamps for &quot; Ten Easy Lessons &quot; .
thumbing rides may save your busfare , but it &apos;s dangerous .
you never know what &apos;s in store for you , when you hear the squeal of brakes .
if only I had known what I was getting into , that day in Arizona .
here , throw that in the back seat .
okay , let &apos;s go . make sure that door &apos;s closed .
you know , Emily Post ought to write a book of rules for guys thumbing rides .
because , as it is now , you never know what &apos;s right and what &apos;s wrong .
we rode along for a little while , neither one of us saying anything .
I was glad of that .
I never know what to say to strange people driving cars .
then too , you can never tell if a guy wants to talk .
a lot of rides have been cut short because of a big mouth .
so I kept my mouth shut until he started opening up .
hand me that little box in the compartment , will ya pal .
hold the wheel , will you .
- How far are you going ?
- L.A. Well , you &apos;re really travelling , aren &apos;t you ?
Yeah , but I don &apos;t expect to make it for a couple of years at the rate I &apos;ve been sporting rides .
- Not much luck , huh ?
- Sure , all bad .
not many people stop for a guy these days . afraid of a stick up , maybe .
well , you can &apos;t blame them .
- Where are you coming from ?
- New York .
well , New York !
well , you &apos;re in luck this time . I &apos;m going all the way . right through to Los Angeles .
- You drive a car ?
- Sure , if you &apos;re tired , let me know .
I &apos;ll holla .
I guess at least an hour passed before I noticed those deep scratches in his right hand .
they were wicked .
three puffy red lines , about a quarter of an inch apart .
he must have seen me looking at them , because he said ...
beauties , aren &apos;t they ?
they &apos;re going to be scars some day .
what an animal !
whatever it was , it must have been pretty big and vicious to have done that .
right on both counts , New York .
I was tussling with the most dangerous animal In the world a woman .
must have been Tarzan &apos;s mate .
looks like , you lost the bout .
it certainly wasn &apos;t a draw .
you know , there should be a law against dangerous claws .
Yeah .
I tossed her out of the car on her ear .
was I wrong ?
give a lift to a tomato , you expect her to be nice , don &apos;t you ?
- Yeah .
- After all , what kind of a dame , thumbs rides ?
- Sunday school teacher ?
- Yeah . a little witch .
must have thought , she was riding with some fall guy .
not me who &apos;s been booking horses around race tracks , since I was twenty .
ahh , I &apos;ve known a million dames like her .
- Two million .
- Yeah .
stopped the car , opened the door ...
&quot; take another hour and stop here , sister &quot; , I told her .
- That &apos;s the stuff
- As I was going on .
if you want to see a real scar , brother , get a load of this .
wow
- I got that one duelling .
- Duelling ?
Yeah , just kidding of course . my dad owned a couple of Franco-Prussian sabres .
kept them on the wall for decoration .
well one day , another kid and I took them down , and the old man wasn &apos;t around ... Had a duel .
he hit me in the arm here .
pretty mean cut . infection set in later .
Yeah , I can see that .
- Oh , give me that box again , will ya .
pain made me lose my head , I guess ... Began slashing ...
before I knew it , I &apos;d put the other kid &apos;s eye out .
that was tough .
Oh , it was just an accident , of course . you know how kids are .
I got scared and decided I was going to run away from home .
old man almost caught me , when I was packing my duds .
the bloody rag I had wrapped around my wrist hadn &apos;t caught his attention he &apos;d have seen the bundle for sure .
so I beat it , when he was phoning for a doctor .
that was fifteen – sixteen years ago .
I haven &apos;t been home since .
pull in there for a bite of something , huh ? I &apos;ll buy you ...
brother , was I hungry . I hadn &apos;t had anything in my stomach for hours .
but even with that gnawing in the pit of my belly .
I didn &apos;t want to be in too big a rush to put on the feed bag .
first , I had to make sure this guy knew the score .
if I got him down on me , goodbye ticket to Hollywood .
- I &apos;ll wait out here for you , mister .
- If it &apos;s the money , don &apos;t worry about paying for it .
this time it &apos;s on me .
- Well , that &apos;s quite ...
- Haskell . think nothing of it .
you make your first million , maybe you can do the same for me . come on , New York .
I gotta make the West Coast by Wednesday .
there &apos;s a horse running at Santa Anita , named &quot; Paradisical &quot; ...
- Means dough to for me , if I &apos;m on it .
- You &apos;ll make it , alright
he did most of the talking , during the half hour we were in the place .
I ate .
he rambled on about his old man , whom he hadn &apos;t heard from since he ran away as a kid , and how he happened to become a bookie .
and then all about how he got rooked in Miami .
one race , 38 grand . they cleaned out my book .
- How do you like that ?
- It was tough luck .
Yeah , and I &apos;m supposed to be the smart guy . you just wait ...
I &apos;m going back to Florida , next season , with all kinds of jack .
and you watch those stinkers run for cover .
- Want anything else ?
- No thanks , I &apos;ve had plenty .
got the cheque there , sister ?
Oh , just a minute !
your change , sir .
- Keep it , sister .
- Oh , thank you , sir . call again .
I &apos;ll be waiting outside for you , when you &apos;ve finished work .
sharp chick , huh ?
I drove all that night , while Haskell slept like a log .
after a while , I began to get sleepy myself .
I was happy though .
soon I &apos;d be with Sue again .
the long trip was practically over , and there &apos;d be no more hoofing it down the concrete .
I began to think of the future which couldn &apos;t have been brighter if I &apos;d embroidered it with neon lights .
it was nice to think of Sue , shooting to the top .
Hmpf ... It &apos;s amazing what a full belly can do to your imagination .
your eyes of blue , your kisses too
I never knew what they could do
I can &apos;t believe that you &apos;re in love with me
you &apos;re telling everyone I know
I &apos;m on your mind each place you go
I can &apos;t believe that you &apos;re in love with me
mister Haskell .
mister Haskell .
mister Haskell , wake up . it &apos;s raining .
don &apos;t you think we ought to stop and put up the top ?
mister Haskell , I &apos;m going to put up the top .
so far , things had been my way but from then on something else stepped in and shunted me off to a different destination than the one I picked for myself for when I pulled open that door ...
Mr Haskell , what &apos;s the matter ? are you hurt ?
are you hurt , Mr Haskell ?
doubtless ...
I &apos;ll listen to it .
... but I know what you &apos;re going to hand me even before you open your mouth .
you &apos;re going to tell me you don &apos;t believe my story about Haskell died and give me that &quot; don &apos;t make me laugh &quot; expression on your smug faces .
I saw at once he was dead ...
and I was in for it .
who would believe that he fell out of the car ?
why if Haskell came to , which of course he couldn &apos;t , even he would swear I conked him over the head for his dough .
Yes , I was in for it .
instinct told me to run , but then I realised it was hopeless .
there were lots of people back down the road who could identify me .
that gas station guy and the waitress .
I would be in a worse spot then , trying to explain why I beat it .
the next possibility was to sit tight and tell the truth when the cops came .
but that would be crazy . they &apos;d laugh at the truth , and I &apos;d have my head in a noose .
so what else was there to do , but hide the body and get away in the car ?
I couldn &apos;t leave the car there with him in the gully .
that would be like erecting a tombstone .
my idea was to cover him with brush , not to rob him .
but then I remembered that even if I only drove the car for a hundred miles or so I would need money for gas .
besides , it was stupid of me to leave all that money on a dead man .
not only that . I &apos;d have to take his drivers license in case I was stopped or something .
I didn &apos;t like to think about it , but by that time I &apos;d done just what the police would say I did even if I didn &apos;t .
my clothes . the owner of such an expensive car would never be wearing them .
some cop might pull me in under suspicion .
Hey you , this your car ?
don &apos;t you know better than to leave a car with the wheels half way in the middle of the road ?
that &apos;s the way accidents happen .
I ...
I &apos;m sorry officer . I was just putting up my top .
- I didn &apos;t think .
- Well , the next time think .
I &apos;ll let you go now , but watch your step in the future .
I know that &apos;s a lonely stretch , but cars come by here once and a while , and we have plenty of crack ups .
thanks officer .
I left nothing in the car that would give me away as Roberts .
if they found a dead man in the gully now , it would be me .
as I drove off , it was still raining and the drops streaked down the windshield like tears .
I kept imagining I was being followed and that I could hear sirens back in the distance .
just how long it took me to cover the 60 odd miles to the California state line I don &apos;t know .
I lost all track of time .
but the rain had stopped and the sun was up when I pulled up to the inspection station .
- Hello . carrying any fruits or vegetables ?
- No .
- Any livestock or poultry ?
- No . I &apos;d like to see your registration and and driver &apos;s license , please .
- Anything in the baggage compartment ?
- Just baggage .
Charles Haskell Jr , age 30 , brown eyes , dark hair identifying marks , none .
- Are you Charles Haskell Jr ?
- Yes .
well , remember that if you &apos;re employed and stay over than 30 days you take out California plates .
alright officer , but I &apos;ll only be in the state a short while .
right , you can go now .
I couldn &apos;t drive any further without any sleep .
cops or no cops I knew I had to hit the hay and hit it hard .
I was dead tired .
no ...
no you can &apos;t , Mr Haskell .
no .
Mr Haskell , you can &apos;t die .
they &apos;ll think ... that I did it .
no , Mr Haskell .
no ... no .
- Who &apos;s there ?
- It &apos;s the maid . can I can come in and clean ?
later .
- In a half hour .
- Alright , sir .
there was no time to lose . every minute I had to be Charles Haskell was dangerous .
and I &apos;d have to be Charles Haskell , until I got to some city where I could leave the car and be swallowed up .
that meant driving the car as far as San Bernardino maybe even to Los Angeles .
in a little town , I might be noticed but in a city , I should be safe enough .
then after I ditched the car , I could go on to Sue .
but those five minutes at the state line made me realise , it might be a good idea to find out a little bit about Mr Haskell .
then if anyone asked me questions I could give the right answers .
the first thing I found out was that I had $ 768 .
this was a lot of jack .
but believe me it was the kind of money I &apos;d rather not have .
and then I found out from a letter Haskell was carting around in his bag that he wasn &apos;t the open-handed easy going big shot who went around buying dinners for strange hitchhikers .
before I got done reading it , I saw him more as a chiseller .
it was written to his old man in California the one he hadn &apos;t seen in so many years .
in it Haskell posed as a salesman of hymnals , of all things .
it was easy to see where Haskell expected to raise the new stake for his book in Miami . by rooking his old man .
that was about all I found out from his effects and it was enough .
I told myself maybe old man Haskell was lucky his son kicked off .
he would never know it , but it saved him from taking a flyer on sacred literature preferred .
near the airport of Desert Centre , I pulled up for water .
there was a woman .
Hey you !
come on , if you want a ride .
- How far are you going ?
- How far are you going ?
that took me by surprise , and I turned turned my head to look her over .
she was facing straight ahead , so I couldn &apos;t see her eyes .
but she was young , not more than 24 .
man , she looked as if she &apos;d just been thrown off the crummiest freight train in the world .
yet in spite of this , I got the impression of beauty .
not the beauty of a movie actress , mind you or the beauty you dream about when you &apos;re with your wife .
but a natural beauty .
a beauty that &apos;s almost homely , because it &apos;s so real .
then suddenly she turned to face me .
- How far did you say we &apos;re going ?
- Los Angeles .
L.A. ?
... L.A &apos;s good enough for me , mister
- That &apos;s what I was afraid of .
- What did you say ? Oh nothing . just thinking out loud .
people get in trouble for doing that .
- What &apos;s your name ?
- You can call me Vera , if you like .
- Do you live in Los Angeles ?
- No . - Where are you coming from ?
- Oh , back there .
- Needles ?
- No . Oh sure , Phoenix . you look just like a Phoenix girl .
are the girls in Phoenix that bad ?
the girl must have been pretty tired , because she fell asleep not twenty minutes after she stepped into the car .
she lay sprawled out with her head resting against the far door like Haskell .
I didn &apos;t like that part of it much but I didn &apos;t wake her up .
it wasn &apos;t that this girl still worried me .
I &apos;d gotten over that funny feeling I had , when she looked at me which I put down as just my jangled nerves .
with her eyes closed , and the tempest gone out of them
she seemed harmless enough .
instead of disliking her , I began to feel sorry for her .
the poor kid probably had had a rough time of it .
who was she anyway ?
and why was she going to Los Angeles ?
and where &apos;d she come from in the first place .
the only thing I knew about her was her name .
not that it made any difference . a few hours more , we &apos;d be in Hollywood .
I &apos;d forget where I parked the car and look up Sue .
this nightmare of being a dead man would be over .
who this dame was , well it was no business of mine .
where did you leave his body ?
where did you leave the owner of this car ?
you &apos;re not fooling anyone .
this buggy belongs to a guy named Haskell . that &apos;s not you , mister .
you &apos;re out of your mind , that &apos;s my name , Charles Haskell .
I can prove it . - My driver &apos;s license .
- Save yourself the trouble , mister .
having Haskell &apos;s wallet only makes it worse .
it just so happens I rode with Charlie Haskell all the way from Louisiana .
he picked me up outside of Shreveport .
- You rode ... - You heard me .
then it all came back to me .
all the talk about duelling and scars and scratches .
there was no doubt about it .
Vera must be the woman Haskell had mentioned .
she must have passed me while I slept .
well ? ... Well , I &apos;m waiting .
my goose was cooked . she had me .
that Haskell guy wasn &apos;t dead yet .
he wasn &apos;t stretched out stiff and cold in any Arizona gully .
he was sitting right there in the car laughing like mad while he haunted me .
well ? there was nothing I could say . it was her move .
Vera or whatever her name was ...
it was just my luck , picking her up on the road .
couldn &apos;t have been Helen or Mary or Evelyn or Ruth .
it had to be the very last person , I should ever have met .
that &apos;s life .
Whichever way you turn , fate sticks out a foot to trip you .
I told her everything , but she didn &apos;t believe my story .
I should have saved my breath .
that &apos;s the greatest cock-and-bull story I ever heard .
so he fell out of his car ?
say , who do you think you &apos;re talking to ?
a hick ? listen mister , I &apos;ve been around , and I know a wrong guy when I see one .
what did you do ?
kiss him with a wrench ? now wait a minute , what I told you is true . you see that &apos;s why I had to do it ?
you think I killed him . well , the cops would have thought so too .
Yeah , well maybe they still think so .
what makes you so sure , I &apos;ll shut up about this .
Vera , I &apos;m innocent . give me a break will you ?
it won &apos;t do me any good having you fenced . the cops are no friends of mine .
now , if there was a reward ...
but there isn &apos;t .
thanks . don &apos;t thank me yet , I &apos;m not through with you by a long shot .
let &apos;s see that roll .
is that all Haskell had ?
- Isn &apos;t it enough ? - No .
I thought he had more . not that I know of . you can search me if you think I &apos;m holding out on you .
well , maybe I will at that .
he told me he was going to bet $ 3,000 on a horse named &quot; Paradisical &quot; on Wednesday at Santa Anita .
- He was stringing you along .
he meant $ 300 .
- Maybe . sure , three bucks , three hundred . he was a piece of cheese a big blowhard .
listen mister , don &apos;t try and tell me anything about Charlie Haskell .
remember , I knew him better than you did .
ok , then you knew he was a four-flusher . that explains the three grand bet .
I &apos;m not so sure , he didn &apos;t have that three grand .
why should I believe you ?
you &apos;ve got all the earmarks of a cheap crook .
- Now wait a minute .
- Shut up . you &apos;re a cheap crook and you killed him .
for two cents , I &apos;d change my mind and turn you in .
I don &apos;t like you . - Alright alright , don &apos;t get sore .
- I &apos;m not getting sore .
but just remember who &apos;s boss around here .
if you shut up and don &apos;t give me any arguments you &apos;ll have nothing to worry about .
but if you act wise I &apos;ll make sure you pop into jail so fast , it &apos;ll give you the bends .
- I &apos;m not arguing .
- We see that you don &apos;t .
you know , as crooked as you look I hate to see a fella as young as you wind up sniffing that perfume that Arizona hands out free to murderers .
- I &apos;m not a murderer .
- Of course , you &apos;re not ... Haskell knocked his own head off .
he fell , that &apos;s all , just like I told you .
sure and then he made you a present of his belongings .
- I explained why I did that .
- Oh , skip it . it doesn &apos;t make a difference one way or another .
I &apos;m not a mourner . I liked Haskell even less than I like you .
- Yeah , I saw what you did to him .
- What do you mean ? - The scratches on his wrist .
- Sure , I scratched him .
I &apos;ll say you did .
so your idea was to drive the car a little way maybe into San Bernardino and then leave it .
you weren &apos;t going to sell it ?
sell it ? do you think I &apos;m crazy ?
somebody else &apos;s car .
Yeah , all I want is to leave it somewhere and forget I ever saw it .
not only don &apos;t you have any scruples , you don &apos;t have any brains .
I don &apos;t get you . maybe , it &apos;s a good thing you met me . you &apos;d have got yourself caught , sure .
why you dope .
don &apos;t you know that a deserted automobile always rates an investigation ?
huh ?
look , the cops find a car . then they get curious .
they wonder where the owner is .
so all right , they don &apos;t trace Haskell .
they trace you . I never thought of that .
the only safe way to get rid of the car is to sell it to a dealer .
get it registered under a new name .
I want to get a bottle and do some shopping before we hit L.A .
ok , if we find a place , I &apos;ll drop you off and pick you up later .
nothing doing . you &apos;re coming in too .
from now on , you and I are like the Siamese twins .
have it your way , but I don &apos;t get the point .
the point is : I don &apos;t want you to get lost .
- I &apos;m not going to beat it , if that &apos;s what you &apos;re afraid of .
- I &apos;ll say you &apos;re not . why I &apos;m going to see you sell this car , so you don &apos;t caught .
thanks .
course your interest wouldn &apos;t be financial , would it ?
you wouldn &apos;t want a small percentage of the profits .
well , now that you insist , how can I refuse .
- A hundred percent will do .
- Fine .
I &apos;m relieved . I thought for a moment , you were going to take it all .
I don &apos;t want to be a hog .
a few hours later , we were in Hollywood .
I was recognising places Sue had written about .
it struck me that far from being at the end of the trip there was a greater distance between Sue and me than when I started out .
Vera wasn &apos;t kidding with that &quot; Siamese twins &quot; crack .
she rented a little apartment as Mrs Charles Haskell .
when I objected to this , she explained it was on account of the car .
the dealer might think something was funny , if he called and found we were using different names .
- Home sweet home .
- Yeah . not bad either .
in case there is any doubt in your mind , I &apos;ll take the bedroom .
Yep .
sure is stuffy in here .
- Keep the windows shut .
- OK . the old crow downstairs said there &apos;s a folding bed behind this door .
you know how to work it ?
I invented it .
- Some joint .
- One can &apos;t have everything .
I &apos;m first in the bathroom .
I don &apos;t know why , but I figured you would be .
boy oh boy !
it sure feels good to be clean again .
I must be 10 pounds lighter .
you must be .
well that &apos;s alright . this is exactly the way you keep your school book induction .
I wish that guy with the sax &apos; would give up .
it gets on my nerves .
forget it .
have a drink .
aren &apos;t you afraid I might take you up on it ?
I didn &apos;t want to give you a drink , I wouldn &apos;t have offered it .
I &apos;m very sorry , Roberts . you got yourself into this thing .
you should be grateful , I &apos;m not turning you in .
why if I wasn &apos;t regular , you &apos;d be in the pen this minute being photographed finger-printed and being pushed around by the cops .
so cheer up . get rid of that long puss .
or is your conscience bothering you ?
no .
- It isn &apos;t . - Swell , that &apos;s good .
he &apos;s dead and no mooning around will bring him back .
anyway , I never could understand this worrying about something all been done with .
now look , Vera , for the last time , I didn &apos;t kill him .
Haskell was sick man . maybe he was dead before he fell out of the car .
I don &apos;t know . sure , sure . he died of old age .
alright so it &apos;ll make you sociable .
you didn &apos;t kill him .
thanks .
- We &apos;re out of liquor , Roberts .
- Yeah . too bad , I felt like getting tight tonight .
- Well , I think you succeeded .
- Am I tight ? as a prima donna &apos;s corset .
that &apos;s good . I wanted to get tight .
why ?
what have got to get tight about .
Oh , I don &apos;t know , a few things .
you should have my worries .
if I had your troubles , I &apos;d stay sober .
and I &apos;ve got the key to that door !
Yep .
- Maybe you &apos;re right .
- I &apos;m always right .
you know , I don &apos;t like your attitude , Roberts .
well , there &apos;s a lot of things I don &apos;t like .
sure is .
life &apos;s like a ball game , you got to take a swing at whatever comes along before you wake up and find it &apos;s the ninth innings .
- You read that somewhere .
- That &apos;s the problem with you , Roberts .
all you do is bellyache
I &apos;m taking it easy , and trying to make the best of things .
maybe that &apos;s what wrong with the whole world .
it &apos;s a profession .
people knock themselves out trying to bust fate .
now take you , for instance . you &apos;re lucky to be alive .
why , supposing Haskell had opened your door .
you &apos;d be playing a harp , now . think of that .
you think of it . I &apos;m tired of thinking .
there &apos;s plenty of people dying this minute would give anything to trade places with you .
I know what I &apos;m talking about .
I &apos;m not so sure .
at least , they know they &apos;re done for .
they don &apos;t have to sweat blood wondering if they are .
your philosophy stinks , pal .
we all know we &apos;re going to kick off some day .
it &apos;s only a question of when .
what got us on this subject anyway ?
we &apos;ll be discussing politics , next .
Yeah .
where &apos;d you hide the butts ?
on the table , sucker .
we are bored each other with conversation for a couple of hours longer .
every five minutes , one of us was wishing we had another bottle or a radio , or something to read .
then finally , we ended ran out of chatter .
I know it &apos;s only eleven o &apos;clock , but I want to get up early and make the rounds of the used car lots .
don &apos;t worry about that we got all the time in the world .
maybe you have , but if you think I want to stay cooped up in this place any longer than I have to , you &apos;re batty .
it &apos;s not a bad place . you pay plenty for digs like this in New York .
I wouldn &apos;t like it , if it was the Ritz .
rotten liquor .
you got a mean cough . you want to do something about it .
I &apos;ll be alright .
that &apos;s what Camille said .
- Who ?
- Nobody you know .
- Wasn &apos;t that the dame that died of consumption
- Yes . wouldn &apos;t it be a break for you , if I did kick off .
you &apos;d be free with old Haskell &apos;s stolen car .
I don &apos;t want to see anybody die .
not even me ?
specially , not you . one person died on me .
if you did . well , that &apos;s all I need .
you don &apos;t like me , do you Roberts ?
like you ?
I love you .
my favourite sport is being kept prisoner .
after we sell the car , you can go to blazes for all I care .
but not until then .
I &apos;m going to bed .
Goodnight , Roberts . don &apos;t try and sneak away during the night .
all doors are locked .
anyway , I find you gone in the morning I &apos;ll notify the police .
- They &apos;ll pick you up . - Don &apos;t worry , I know when I &apos;m in a spot .
well , good night .
I hope that that portable rack isn &apos;t too uncomfortable for you .
don &apos;t lose any sleep over it , will you Vera ?
Crest View 6-5-7-2-3
Hello ? Hello ?
Hello ?
Hello ?
no . not yet , darling .
tomorrow ... maybe .
if this were fiction , I would fall in love with Vera .
marry her and make a respectable woman of her .
or else , she would make some supreme , Class A sacrifice for me and die .
Sue and I would bawl a little over her grave and make some crack about there &apos;s good in all of us .
but Vera , unfortunately , was just as rotten in the morning as she &apos;d been the night before .
alright alright , I &apos;m coming .
look Vera , it &apos;s almost noon .
so what ? the dealers will be there all day .
they &apos;ll be there all year too , but we don &apos;t have to wait that long .
shut up . you &apos;re making like a husband .
- Well , do I rate a whistle ?
- You sure do , but let &apos;s go .
I spend $ 85 and two hours preparing bait and all you can say is , &quot; Let &apos;s go &quot; .
come on .
we passed a few used car lots last night down this way .
what do you think we can get for this heap ?
I don &apos;t know . plenty . just let me handle everything .
think you can get two thousand dollars ?
but don &apos;t worry ... I &apos;ll squeeze as much out of this guy , as I can .
if I let it go cheap without a fight , he might think we &apos;ve stolen the car .
and listen , don &apos;t make any slips and call me Roberts .
that &apos;ll cook us . I don &apos;t need you to tell me that .
you better just sit by and keep your mouth closed .
remember we &apos;re both in the soup , if anything happens ...
- Forget it and drive .
- You &apos;re my wife , Vera Haskell .
look , after the deal &apos;s closed let &apos;s go back to that place on Hollywood Boulevard where I saw the fur jacket .
I want to buy it . after the deal &apos;s closed , I &apos;m saying goodbye to you .
that &apos;s right , I forgot . I guess I &apos;m getting kind of used to you .
well that &apos;s a habit you can start breaking .
let &apos;s try this place in the middle of the block .
good afternoon , what can I do for you ?
- We &apos;re interested in selling a car .
- If the price is right .
well , if it &apos;s in good mechanical condition , it should bluebook for about $ 1600 .
Tony , take a look at this motor .
sixteen hundred , are you kidding ?
well , maybe $ 1850 .
before I let it go for $ 1850 , I &apos;ll wreck it and collect the insurance first .
lady , this motor &apos;s seen a lot of driving .
while the mechanic inspected the car we haggled .
at last , when we were all worn out we hit a compromise his price .
- OK , it &apos;s a deal .
- Right , come in and we &apos;ll sign the papers .
I have the ownership papers right here with me .
look Vera , in the meantime , will you clean out the ash compartment .
- Maybe there &apos;s some stuff in it .
- Alright , darling .
1850 bucks , that dirty crook .
- Hmm , New York , huh ?
- Yup . - But you bought the car in Miami .
- Yes . well , let &apos;s see about the insurance , we can either have it transferred or cancelled .
Ah , what kind of insurance do you have , Mr. Haskell ?
well ah aren &apos;t all the papers there ?
I don &apos;t see any . surely you know what type of insurance you carry on the car .
the name of the company ?
Yeah , but ...
well , if you &apos;ll just tell me the name of the company ...
- ... I &apos;d be very glad to take care of all the details .
- Well ...
- Did you sign the papers yet ?
- Not yet . well don &apos;t .
we &apos;re not selling the car .
- Well , wait a minute , Mrs Haskell .
- Come on darling . - What &apos;s the matter ?
change your mind ?
- Yes , I &apos;m sorry , I guess I have .
- But , Vera ...
you got me out of a tight spot Vera , but I still don &apos;t understand all this .
you will in a minute . I almost threw away a gold mine .
$ 1850 isn &apos;t to be sneezed at .
the car doesn &apos;t book for as much as I thought .
- We &apos;re not selling the car .
- You want to keep it ?
now wait a minute , Vera , you said yourself I wouldn &apos;t be safe until the car was in someone else &apos;s name .
I &apos;d like to be free of this mess , when I go .
that &apos;s just it , Robert , you &apos;re not going .
pull in there and we &apos;ll get a bite to eat and , I &apos;ll explain .
what is this - another one of your brilliant ideas ?
- Hello , may I take your order ?
- Make mine , a ham sandwich and coffee .
- And for you sir ?
- Oh , I don &apos;t care ... the same .
thank you .
get this , Vera . I &apos;ve been pretty patient , so far .
- I &apos;ve done everything you asked me to do , but no more .
- Shut up !
we &apos;ve taken Haskell &apos;s money ...
you can have the dough we get from selling the car but you &apos;re not going to keep me a prisoner .
it &apos;s a good thing I bought the paper .
take a look at that . - Vera , I &apos;m in no mood ...
- Read that !
- No .
- Yes .
- No , I won &apos;t do it .
- Yes , you will . you think I &apos;m crazy ?
it &apos;s impossible I tell you .
excuse me .
blow the horn when you &apos;re through .
no one could possibly get away with an act like that .
they &apos;d be wise to me in a minute Don &apos;t be yellow .
you look enough like him . the same colouring and the same build .
see how his clothes fit ? I &apos;m not kidding .
you almost had me fooled for a while . Oh , grow up , Vera . don &apos;t you think a father knows his own son ?
and there must be other relatives .
the father won &apos;t have to know you .
we &apos;ll wait till he gives up the ghost . he &apos;s an old geezer and he won &apos;t pull through .
and as far as the relatives are concerned ...
they haven &apos;t seen you in fifteen or twenty years .
- Eat . - I &apos;m not hungry ...
and I won &apos;t do it .
it &apos;s not as tough as it sounds .
remember , you &apos;ve got all kinds of identification : his car , letters , license ...
I could never get away with it .
it &apos;s the stupidest thing I &apos;ve ever heard . the old boy has bags of dough .
look in the paper there ... Personal fortune assessed over fifteen million .
he &apos;ll leave plenty , I tell you .
maybe he cut off his son .
how do we know ? it &apos;s out , Vera . I won &apos;t have anything to do with it .
I think you will .
look Vera , I &apos;ll do anything within reason .
but not that . so forget it .
find yourself another stooge . you &apos;re sick .
you &apos;d be fixed for the rest of your life as Charlie Haskell .
you can take your inheritance and go away .
no more worrying about the rent , no sweating scheming , wondering where your next meal &apos;s coming from .
think about that , Roberts . Vera , please . you &apos;re talking too loud .
unless I &apos;m splitting 50-50 with you ?
sure . why not ? - We &apos;re both alike , both born the same guy .
- Take it easy , Vera .
people around here are going to hear you talk .
we &apos;ll wait until we read old man Haskell &apos;s dead .
then you show up . like you read in New York that he was sick .
no .
- Suppose he doesn &apos;t die ?
- He will , I know he will .
but as much as I insisted , I would have no part of her scheme .
Vera was taking it for granted , I would .
neither of us had our minds on the cards as we played that night .
I knew we were just trying to kill time between newspaper editions .
this was a death watch , for Vera .
maybe it was for me too .
don &apos;t you realise , if I &apos;m caught , they &apos;ll want to know where I got the car and stuff .
- And they &apos;ll have me on a murder charge .
- If you &apos;re smart , you won &apos;t get caught .
I &apos;m out for seven . if I &apos;m caught , don &apos;t you realise you &apos;ll be out too ?
18 points . that gives me 30 .
how will I be out ?
you &apos;ll be out $ 1850 , you would have gotten on the car .
really Vera , you &apos;ll be an awful chump . you threw away all that dough on a dizzy long shot .
let me sell the bus tomorrow .
with the money it &apos;ll bring and what you &apos;ve already got a clever kid like you could run it up in no time .
- And we &apos;d both be in the clear . - I &apos;ll be in the clear anyway .
maybe . maybe . but if I got caught ...
- I &apos;d get good and sore too , you know .
- You mean you &apos;d squeal ?
- Well no , not squeal exactly
- Never mind what you meant .
even if you did tell the cops , I was in on it with you what could they do to me ?
they might give me the same medicine they gave you .
- Yeah .
but I &apos;m on my way now .
all they &apos;d be doing would be rushing it .
alright , but think of the $ 1850 you &apos;d lose
you &apos;d kick yourself around the block , if you let it get away from you .
I &apos;ll take the chance .
- Want another drink ?
- You being a goon . that &apos;s the way people wind up behind the eight ball ...
once they get a few dollars , they become greedy and want more .
- More . more . - Caesar .
- Who ?
- You know , that Roman general .
he got his , for being greedy . he wasn &apos;t satisfied , so the final wind up was he took the count .
a couple of days ago , you didn &apos;t have a dime .
why you were so broke , you couldn &apos;t pay cash for a postage stamp .
now you &apos;ve got almost $ 700 , with $ 1850 in the offing .
- Take my advice , don &apos;t try for more !
- I &apos;m tired of this game .
- Let &apos;s have some black jack .
- Play solitaire !
ok I will , if that &apos;s the way you feel about it .
that &apos;s the way I feel about it . getting sore and throwing things won &apos;t help much , Roberts .
I &apos;m really doing you a favour . I help you out of a jam by keeping my mouth shut .
I show you how to make some soft money , and what thanks do I get .
- Thanks ?
!
- Sure , or would you rather I called the cops and tell them you killed the man and stole his money .
- I didn &apos;t kill anybody .
- Yes , you did . no , I didn &apos;t .
alright , then .
suppose I call the cops ...
if you &apos;re innocent , what have you got to be scared of ?
ok , call them , if you must . go ahead , call them . see if I care .
at least they &apos;ll give me a square deal .
- You want me to call them ?
- You heard me . but I &apos;m warning you ...
if I &apos;m pinched , I &apos;ll swear you were in on it . I &apos;ll say that you helped me .
- If I fry , I &apos;ll get even with you .
- You wouldn &apos;t dare , you &apos;re chicken !
Yeah ? then try it and see . call them .
okay I will .
information ?
I want the number of the Hollywood police station .
ok , I got it . thanks .
wait a minute , Vera , you wouldn &apos;t do that .
let me do it , and I &apos;ll show you if I would .
take it easy . now let &apos;s talk this over .
this was early in the evening .
and the conversation while hectic was at least pitched low .
but as the minutes passed and more obstacles to her plan popped into in my head the air got blue .
each word coming from our lips cracked like a whip .
I reminded her that as Charles Haskell , I didn &apos;t even know my mother &apos;s name where I &apos;d gone to school , the name of my best friend whether I had an Aunt Emma or not , my religion and if I &apos;d ever owned a dog .
I didn &apos;t even know what my middle initial stood for .
I also pointed out that the real Haskell had a scar on his forearm .
his people never saw that scar .
you told me he ran away right after putting out the kid &apos;s eye .
Yeah , but his father knew he was cut .
- There &apos;d be some kind of a mark .
- So what ?
the old man &apos;s dead or will be , I hope , by tomorrow morning &apos;s papers .
anyway , you could cut yourself a little , couldn &apos;t you ?
boy , for that kind of dough , I &apos;d let you cut my leg off .
you &apos;re drunk and you &apos;re crazy mad , Vera .
turn me in , if you want to , but I won &apos;t get mixed up in this .
besides , how do we know ? Haskell was such a phony .
maybe he wasn &apos;t the man &apos;s son after all . maybe he just dreamed it up .
well , dreaming or not you won &apos;t be dreaming when the law taps you on the shoulder .
there &apos;s a cute little gas chamber waiting for you , Roberts .
and I hear extradition to Arizona &apos;s a cinch .
where &apos;s that phone ?
- Vera !
- Leave me alone .
- Vera !
- I want a phone call , police .
I hate you , you stinking ... You leave me alone !
I &apos;ll let you alone when you promise to leave the phone where it is .
you &apos;re drunk . you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing
- You &apos;re hurting me ,
- Will you promise ?
alright .
you hurt me .
- I &apos;m sorry , but ... - It &apos;s hot in here , open up the window !
- It &apos;s not hot .
- Don &apos;t tell me . now do you do it or do I do it ?
- You &apos;re no gentleman , see ?
- Yeah .
alright , I &apos;ll open up the window .
Vera !
Vera , open the door . please open the door .
Vera , open the door . don &apos;t use the phone . listen to me .
I don &apos;t like you , Roberts .
you &apos;re no gentleman , see . you hurt my hand .
and I &apos;m going to get even with you .
you don &apos;t open the door , I &apos;m going to kick it down , Vera .
Vera , don &apos;t call the cops . listen to me . I &apos;ll do anything you say .
Vera , let me in .
I &apos;ll break the phone !
Vera ...
the world is full of sceptics .
I know - I &apos;m one myself .
in the Haskell business , how many of you would believe he fell out of the car ?
and now , after killing Vera without really meaning to do it .
how many of you would believe it wasn &apos;t premeditated .
in a jury room , every last man of you would go down shouting that she had me over a barrel and my only out was force .
the room was still .
so quiet that for a while I wondered if I had suddenly gone deaf .
it was pure fear of course . and I was hysterical .
but without making a sound .
Vera was dead and I was her murderer .
murderer !
what an awful word that is .
but I had become one . I &apos;d better not get caught .
what evidence there was around the place had to be destroyed .
and from the looks of things , there was plenty .
looking around the room , at the things we &apos;d bought was like looking into the faces of a hundred people , who had seen us together and who remembered me .
this was the kind of testimony , I couldn &apos;t rub out .
no . I could burn clothes and hide bottles for the next five years .
there &apos;d always be witnesses .
the landlady for one . she could identify me .
the car dealer , the waitress in the drive-in , the girl in the dress shop and the guy in the liquor store .
they could all identify me .
I was cooked . done for . I had to get out of there .
while once I had remained beside a dead body planning carefully how to avoid being accused of killing him this time I couldn &apos;t .
this time I was guilty .
I knew it .
felt it .
I was like a guy suffering from shock .
things were whirling around in my head .
I couldn &apos;t make myself think right .
all I could think of was the guy with the saxophone and what he was playing .
it wasn &apos;t a love song .
it was a dirge .
but my problems weren &apos;t solved .
I had to stay away from New York for all time .
because Al Roberts was listed as dead , and had to stay dead .
and I could never to go back to Hollywood .
someone might recognize me as Haskell ...
then too , there was Sue ...
I could never go to her with a thing like this hanging over my head .
all I could do was pray she &apos;d be happy .
I was in Bakersfield , before I read that Vera &apos;s body was discovered and that the police were looking for Haskell in connection with his wife &apos;s murder .
isn &apos;t that a laugh ?
Haskell got me into this mess , and Haskell was getting me out of it .
the police were searching for a dead man .
I keep trying to forget what happened and wonder what my life might have been , if that car of Haskell &apos;s hadn &apos;t stopped .
but one thing , I don &apos;t have to wonder about .
I know someday a car will stop to pick me up that I never thumbed .
Yes .
fate ... or some mysterious force can put the finger on you or me for no good reason at all .
Subtitles by DHM
it &apos;s good to see you , Dick .
it &apos;s good to be back .
everything &apos;s been arranged . she &apos;s up there waiting for you .
thank you .
poor dear man .
I ... I guess I &apos;ll be going now .
good luck to you , Dick .
been through hell , hasn &apos;t he ?
to a man like that , two years in prison is worse than hell .
isn &apos;t that Dick Harland , the chap who used to live in Back of the Moon ?
Yes , I believe it is .
well , of all the seven deadly sins , jealousy is the most deadly .
Oh , will you bring us some coffee , please ?
- You were his lawyer , weren &apos;t you ?
- Yes , I defended him .
some might say I lost the case for him .
I read the newspapers , but somehow I never could make head nor tail of it .
well , there were some things that couldn &apos;t be told in the courtroom .
yet , of all the people involved , I suppose I &apos;m the only one who knew the whole story .
you see , it was through me they first met .
he &apos;d been working very hard on a new book .
I invited him up to my place in New Mexico for a rest .
they met on the train .
- Thank you . - You &apos;re quite welcome .
Oh , I &apos;m sorry . I was staring at you , wasn &apos;t I ?
I didn &apos;t mean to , really . it &apos;s only because ... because you look so much like my father .
when he was younger , of course ... your age .
a most remarkable resemblance .
for a moment , I thought ...
do forgive me .
well , to tell you the truth , I was doing quite a bit of staring myself .
and I assure you it &apos;s not because you look like my mother .
as a matter of fact , I can &apos;t say you look like anyone I &apos;ve ever met before .
then why did you stare ?
do you really want to know ?
if it &apos;s not too unflattering .
now , you know perfectly well that nothing I could say about you ... the way you look , I mean ... could be anything but flattering .
- Of course , if you don &apos;t like flattery ... - Oh , but I do .
on second thought , it won &apos;t be flattery . it &apos;ll be the truth and nothing but the truth .
any resemblance to flattery will be sheer coincidence .
shall I proceed ?
proceed .
while I was watching you , exotic words drifted across the mirror of my mind , as summer clouds drift across the sky .
couldn &apos;t you be a bit more specific ?
I &apos;ll try .
watching you , I thought of tales in The Arabian Nights , of myrrh and frankincense and ...
and patchouli ?
patchouli , that &apos;s it .
wait a minute .
I knew it . here it is .
I quote : &quot; as he watched her , exotic words drifted across the mirror of his mind .
he thought of tales in The Arabian Nights , of myrrh and frankincense and patchouli . &quot;
Unquote .
so that &apos;s where it came from . well , I guess so .
but really I wasn &apos;t ... I give you my word . it &apos;s weeks since I read the thing .
it must have impressed you enormously .
the book ?
not particularly .
rather a sloppy job , I thought . I agree with you .
you do ?
next stop , Jacinto .
next stop , Jacinto !
Oh , that &apos;s me .
Jacinto ! that &apos;s me .
Oh !
there you are !
Hello there !
Oh , it &apos;s nice to see you .
Hello , Mrs. Berent . Hello . Hello !
Hello , baby .
how are you ?
Hello , Glen . how are you ? and how &apos;s Louise ?
and the children ? fine .
wonderful . Charlie , get those bags , will you , please ?
- Oh , we &apos;re looking forward to seeing the ranch . - Can you stay long ?
here !
here we are !
Hello there !
Hello , Glen . how are you ?
nice to see you . glad to see you , Dick .
Oh , you look fine . how &apos;s your brother ?
Oh , Danny &apos;s still flat on his back .
he wanted very much to come , but the doctor thought the trip might be too much for him .
Oh , I &apos;m sorry .
ladies , may I present Mr. Harland .
Mrs. Berent . how do you do ?
how do you do , Mrs. Berent ?
Ruth Berent .
how do you do ? Hello . Ellen Berent .
how do you do ?
how do you do ? we met on the train , rather briefly .
too briefly .
well , I &apos;ve got the car right here , folks . you all ready ?
come on .
did you say &quot; Harland &quot; ?
Richard Harland .
Oh , Mr. Harland , I &apos;m terribly sorry .
I doubt if I &apos;ll ever forgive you .
- Ruth , wait till you get a look at the new colts . - Oh , I bet they &apos;re darling .
Ellen , we &apos;ve got plenty of wild turkey this year . wonderful !
big as ostriches , twice as ornery .
hope you people are all good and hungry .
- Here we are .
- Mom , they &apos;re here !
they &apos;re here !
welcome to Rancho Jacinto . thank you , Glen .
Oh , Mother , isn &apos;t this wonderful ?
Oh , it &apos;s beautiful !
Ruth !
Ruth !
Oh , my dear .
Margaret !
Oh , I did want to come to the train to meet you , but I thought it best to stay here to supervise dinner .
Hello , children . how are you ? Ellen .
Dick , it &apos;s so good seeing you , but where &apos;s Danny ?
he couldn &apos;t quite make it this time , Louise . Oh , I &apos;m terribly sorry .
is he still at Warm Springs ? Yes .
he &apos;s getting along just fine .
Oh , good !
you &apos;ll probably want to change .
come . I &apos;ll show you your room .
those trout were in the stream a couple of hours ago .
that &apos;s something you couldn &apos;t get in Boston . perhaps not .
but on the other hand , our codfish ...
I was born and raised in Boston myself , and I yield to no one in my passion for codfish . I hate codfish .
- So do I. - Children , that &apos;s rank disloyalty .
- It &apos;s treason . - Mr. Harland , what do you think ?
well , Mrs. Robie , I &apos;m what you call a salmon man .
the fact of the matter is , Mother just doesn &apos;t like New Mexico .
since this is my first visit to New Mexico , I don &apos;t see how you can say such a thing .
it &apos;s true just the same .
father and I used to come here every spring , year after year .
and occasionally Ruth came along , but never Mother .
it &apos;s too bad Mr. Berent didn &apos;t come along this time . I &apos;ve been told I resemble him .
- Who told you that , Mr. Harland ?
- I did .
Louise , don &apos;t you think so ?
well , yes , now that you mention it . Glen ?
- Well , in a way . - In every way .
I noticed it the minute I saw him in the club car ... his face , his voice , his manner .
it &apos;s uncanny . well , I must admit you &apos;ve aroused my curiosity .
if I should get an opportunity to meet your father-
that &apos;s hardly likely , Mr. Harland .
my husband ... We &apos;ve come here for my father &apos;s funeral .
my goodness . there is a resemblance .
why , a most decided resemblance .
tell me , what do they mean about coming here for the funeral ?
Oh , that was rather a figure of speech .
as a matter of fact , Professor Berent died some time ago in the East , and his body was cremated .
they brought the ashes here . they &apos;re having the ceremony in the morning .
where ?
high up in the mountains , sort of a plateau .
a favorite spot of his . he used to go there a lot with Ellen .
well , now , if you &apos;ll excuse me , I &apos;ll see if the children have gone to bed .
- Hello . - Hello .
- Ellen &apos;s gone for a walk . - Well , how did you know that I ...
Oh , I &apos;m quite psychic .
Oh . and is your sister psychic too ?
Oh , yes . much more than I am .
only I &apos;m not her sister . you &apos;re not ?
no , I &apos;m her cousin .
I &apos;ve lived with the family ever since I was a child . Mrs. Berent adopted me .
good evening , Mr. Harland .
in all fairness , I must confess ... the nights here seem more beautiful than they do at Beacon Hill .
infinitely . I think everything &apos;s more beautiful here .
Ellen has gone for a stroll . thank you .
Hello .
am I intruding ?
not at all .
I ... Well , I &apos;m afraid I owe you an apology .
it was rather clumsy of me at the table to speak of your father .
that &apos;s all right . you couldn &apos;t have known .
you were very close to your father , weren &apos;t you ?
Yes , we were inseparable .
from the time I was able to walk , we were both happiest when we were together .
engagement ring ?
Yes .
now , I believe I &apos;d better be going in now .
we &apos;re getting up at 5 : 00 in the morning .
good night . good night .
don &apos;t you think somebody ought to go look for Ellen ?
what for ?
well , it &apos;s pretty wild country up there . perhaps she &apos;s lost .
Oh , Ellen knows her way home .
why , I know , but it &apos;s been over 12 hours . suppose something happened to her .
nothing ever happens to Ellen .
well , I ... I think I &apos;ll take a ride before I turn in .
are you all right ?
Oh , yes . perfectly .
I just wanted to be alone for a while .
thank you for coming to the funeral this morning . you knew I was there ?
Yes , I saw you as I rode by . I ...
I hope you don &apos;t think it was just curiosity .
no , I understand . I &apos;m glad you were there .
so am I. I &apos;ll never forget it .
father used to say it was like riding across the front lawn of heaven .
we made a pact to bring our ashes here when we died .
&quot; if you die first , &quot; I told him , &quot; I &apos;ll bring yours here .
and if I die first , you &apos;ll bring mine . &quot;
yet I know now , people you love don &apos;t really die .
can we go now ?
I &apos;m not a bit sleepy . are you ?
not in the least .
have you forgiven me yet ?
what I said about your book . Oh , that .
I have an altogether different opinion now .
I finished reading your book last night , and I found it quite absorbing .
well , what made you change your mind ?
I got interested in one of the characters . - Which one ?
- The author .
well , I assure you the book is not supposed to be about me .
Oh , but it is , whether you like it or not .
&quot; every book &apos;s a confession , &quot; my father always said .
course you have to read between the lines . - And did you ?
- Mm-hmm . well , what sort of man am I ?
you &apos;re a bachelor , 30 years old .
you were born and raised in Boston , and you went to Harvard where you edited The Lampoon .
when you graduated , you went to Paris and you studied painting for a while .
you have a lodge in Maine called Back of the Moon .
before you went in for writing novels , you were a newspaperman .
your favorite sport is fishing , and you speak French and Spanish quite well .
well , shades of Sherlock .
do you mean to say you got all that just from reading my book ?
just from reading the dust jacket .
it was all there under your picture , you know .
you know , if you &apos;d lived in Salem a hundred years ago , they &apos;d have burned you .
why did you give up painting ?
well , it was like this .
I ... In the first place , I discovered I was color-blind .
but since I was interested in Postimpressionism , that didn &apos;t matter much , did it ?
no .
however , when I made the acquaintance of the boys on the Left Bank , I found that they lived in squalid garrets , and most of them were miserably undernourished .
have you ever known what it was to be really hungry ?
I &apos;m hungry right now . good heavens , you must be .
- You haven &apos;t had dinner , have you ?
- Nor lunch .
why , you poor thing , you must be famished .
Mrs. Robie told Emily to leave you a tray . good .
Oh , there it is !
I &apos;ll get it .
let me .
tell me about your place in Maine .
Oh , it &apos;s just a cabin , a shack , that &apos;s all .
but it &apos;s set down in just about the most beautiful country I &apos;ve ever seen .
why do you call it &quot; Back of the Moon &quot; ?
well , there &apos;s a lake up there , shaped like a crescent .
Danny and I used to spend all our summers there .
you love Danny a lot , don &apos;t you ?
well , naturally , I ...
is that why you &apos;ve never married ... because you &apos;ve had to take care of him ?
- No , not exactly .
the way I feel about marriage ...
well , it &apos;s like ... Thank you .
it &apos;s like that trip I made to Europe after I was graduated .
I hadn &apos;t the least idea of going abroad . it just happened .
I was taking a walk with a girl , and we went down to Boston wharf ... and watched a freighter being loaded , and I liked the looks of her .
- The girl ?
- No , the freighter .
she looked good to me , and she smelled good to me .
I didn &apos;t even know where she was going , but I knew I was going with her .
and I did .
Hey , this is about the tastiest sandwich I &apos;ve ever eaten .
- What is it ?
- Turkey .
wild turkey . - Ever hunted them ?
- No , I haven &apos;t . it &apos;s tricky shooting .
they &apos;re sort of scary , but they &apos;re so big and clumsy , they hate to take wing .
- It &apos;s a lot of fun . - I &apos;d like to try it sometime .
how about tomorrow ?
well , if Glen has no other plans .
- I meant just the two of us . - I &apos;d love to .
why did you come for me tonight ? well , I ...
I don &apos;t know exactly .
everybody assured me you &apos;d be perfectly all right . I guess it was just an impulse .
like the time you took the freighter ? Yes .
you knew I was coming up there tonight .
you were waiting for me , weren &apos;t you ?
Yes .
and you came , didn &apos;t you ?
well .
good night .
come on .
Hello !
what &apos;s going on up there ? I &apos;m just pruning and tying up the roses .
I hope I wasn &apos;t interfering with your work .
Oh , not at all . I &apos;m glad you &apos;re here .
I was thinking about you , something you said the other night .
- What did I say ?
- Something rather strange .
you said you &apos;d been adopted by Mrs. Berent .
well , what &apos;s so strange about that ?
well , you didn &apos;t say &quot; Mr. And Mrs. Berent . &quot;
- Weren &apos;t you adopted by both of them ? - Well , yes , of course .
- Then why did you say &quot; Mrs. Berent &quot; ?
- I don &apos;t know .
I suppose it was because she suggested that ...
she was alone so much of the time , and I ...
I mustn &apos;t keep you from your work .
be careful . Oh , I &apos;m all right .
how &apos;s that for an entrance ?
perfect . I &apos;m delighted to see you .
- All of you . - Thank you .
I do hope I &apos;ve interrupted you in your work .
you have . constantly , all morning .
but how could I ?
I haven &apos;t been with you until just now .
Oh , yes , you have . I &apos;ve been thinking about you and about Quinton .
- Who told you his name ?
- Glen Robie .
- How did he happen to tell you ?
- I asked him .
- Why ?
- Because I hated Quinton .
- Do you know him ? - No .
- Then why do you hate him ?
- Because you knew him .
that &apos;s nice .
you going to hate everybody I know ?
you &apos;ve lost your ring .
no . I took it off an hour ago .
forever .
come on !
hurry up !
I &apos;ll race you across .
one , two , three , go !
Attaboy , Lin !
come on , Lin !
keep it up !
come on !
- Lin &apos;s going to win . - No . Ellen .
Ellen always wins .
the winner !
don &apos;t forget we have a date after lunch .
quiet , Chris !
lie down !
what &apos;s the matter with you ?
Oh , come in . Hello , Robie .
quiet , Chris . quiet .
- Let me take your things . - Thank you .
here , let me fix that for you .
well , hello .
what in the world brought you here ?
an airplane .
I grabbed the first one I could catch after getting your telegram yesterday .
why all the rush ?
I wanted to be among the first to congratulate you ... on your forthcoming marriage .
well , we hadn &apos;t planned to announce it for a while , but since you &apos;ve let the cat out of the bag ...
darling , this is Russell Quinton .
my fiancé , Richard Harland .
how do you do ?
might I have a moment with you alone ?
certainly . we can go in the library .
will you excuse us ?
Mrs. Berent . Ruth .
Dick . Dick , is it true ?
I &apos;m so happy for Ellen , for both of you . Oh , thank you , Ruth .
- That &apos;s all very well , but what I want to know is when and how . - Well ...
I &apos;m sorry , Russ . really I am .
I never expected you to come here in the midst of a political campaign .
when do you plan to be married ?
as soon as possible .
would it be convenient for you to postpone it until the fall ?
until after election , you mean .
well , it wouldn &apos;t do me much good for the news to get out that I &apos;d been ... jilted and thrown aside like an old shoe .
Oh , come now , Russ .
surely there &apos;s no political significance in the fact that a lady has changed her mind .
I don &apos;t understand it , Ellen . I always knew you &apos;d never marry me while your father was alive .
but after he died , I thought ...
well , I thought there might be a chance . what happened ?
I &apos;m in love .
we intend to get married at once .
tomorrow .
don &apos;t look so downcast . I &apos;ll still be able to vote for you .
perhaps you don &apos;t think I &apos;m good enough for you ... or romantic enough .
I know people thought I was marrying into the Berent family for reasons , but that &apos;s not true .
I want you to know that I had only one reason .
I want you to know that I was in love with you .
I &apos;m not a man who loves often , Ellen . I love once .
thank you , Russ .
that &apos;s quite a concession .
I loved you .
and I &apos;m still in love with you .
that &apos;s a tribute .
and I always will be .
remember that .
Russ , is that a threat ?
now , look here , Ellen .
darling , will you marry me ?
why , you unpredictable little ...
and I &apos;ll never let you go .
never , never , never .
Ellen !
there he is .
Danny .
Dick .
easy , boy . easy .
Oh , Dick .
Hey , you &apos;ve put on weight . - Say , I believe you &apos;ve actually grown .
- You look sort of different yourself . - You get my telegram ?
- Yeah , but I didn &apos;t sleep much that night .
I just kept thinking , &quot; Now he &apos;s left the ranch , and now he &apos;s in Chicago . &quot;
I kept seeing that train coming nearer and nearer .
- I counted every turn of the wheels . - May I come in ?
- Hi , Danny . - Hi , Ellen .
I hope you like her , Danny , because if you don &apos;t , we &apos;ll send her right back .
Oh , please don &apos;t let him fire me , Danny . I like this job .
don &apos;t you worry . if he fires you , I &apos;ll hire you .
thank you .
were you surprised to get my letter ?
not a bit .
I knew what was in that letter even before I opened it .
I just kept reading it over and over again .
just to sort of- Get used to the idea ? Yeah .
I was trying to picture what kind of a place Taos was , how long the honeymoon is .
Ellen didn &apos;t like Taos .
I thought Warm Springs would be a much better place for a honeymoon .
- Gosh , I hope you can stay a while .
- We &apos;re gonna take a cottage right here in Warm Springs .
and live here , you mean ? that &apos;s right .
that &apos;s Ellen &apos;s idea .
that &apos;s the way she wants it .
gosh .
well , Mrs. Harland , I think I can feel safe in saying the job is permanent .
thank you , sir . I always does my best .
I trust you &apos;ll find the soup to your taste .
Mmm .
it &apos;s sheer understatement to call this ambrosia soup .
I call it consommé a la patchouli .
when you get around to hiring a cook , be sure and teach her the recipe .
I have no intention of hiring a cook or a housekeeper or any other servants .
you mean , for the present . I mean ever .
- Idiot . - I don &apos;t want anybody else but me to do anything for you .
I want to keep your house and wash your clothes and cook your food .
a born slavey . besides , I don &apos;t want anybody else in the house but us .
ever ? ever .
well , but suppose in the natural course of events ...
well , that &apos;s different . and what about Danny ?
well , that &apos;s different too .
and only three people have ever been to Back of the Moon .
that &apos;s me and Dick and Thorne . who &apos;s Thorne ?
Leick Thorne . he &apos;s a woodsman . he helped build the house and the dam and the boathouse and all .
he takes care of the place . I &apos;d like to get hold of some of Richard &apos;s baby pictures .
- Could I , do you suppose ? - Oh , yeah .
there &apos;s a whole album full .
lot of college yearbooks with loads of pictures of him .
only there &apos;s one he doesn &apos;t like to show to anybody .
why not ?
well , it &apos;s got a picture of Enid Southern in it .
who &apos;s she ?
she &apos;s the one they voted the best-looking girl .
was she really beautiful ?
not as beautiful as you are .
thank you , Danny .
won &apos;t it be wonderful when you can go back to school again ?
gosh , yes . what sort of school did you go to ?
same one as Dick . Boarding school ?
Yeah . Oh , that must be fun .
sure is .
uh , has Dick been busy lately ?
Yes , he &apos;s been working awfully hard on his book , and we mustn &apos;t interrupt him .
besides , have you forgotten our secret ?
Danny !
Dick !
Dick !
Danny . Danny .
now we can all three of us go to Back of the Moon .
can &apos;t we , Dick ?
can &apos;t we ?
you bet we can . you bet we can .
it &apos;s way up north , miles from nowhere .
I know all about that place . I &apos;ve heard about it plenty from Danny .
he can &apos;t wait to get up there again .
I know . that &apos;s my problem .
you see , Dr. Mason , my husband is planning ... to leave for Back of the Moon as soon as possible .
and he wants to take Danny with us .
so do I , of course . what &apos;s the problem ?
well , it &apos;s so remote up there , wild and rugged and miles from the nearest town .
the facilities are rather primitive .
there isn &apos;t even a telephone ... just in case we need to reach a doctor for Danny .
I &apos;m quite sure he won &apos;t need a doctor up there . or medicine or something ?
or medicine or anything . - But what about school ?
- That can wait .
I must say , Danny &apos;s progress has been rather remarkable .
I don &apos;t know how you did it . you must &apos;ve practically willed that boy to walk .
but don &apos;t you see , Doctor ?
my husband will be busy a good deal of the time writing .
and with nobody else around ... Isn &apos;t there somebody there , somebody with the name of Thorne ?
Yes , but he &apos;s leaving , and so it &apos;ll be ...
I assure you , I don &apos;t want to shirk any responsibility .
I &apos;m thinking only of Danny , and I ...
no , that isn &apos;t true .
I &apos;m thinking a little about myself too .
I know you &apos;ll understand , Dr. Mason .
I gave up my honeymoon to come here so that my husband could be with his brother .
but he &apos;s been working , and the burden &apos;s been on me .
I &apos;ve spent hours here , every day .
I was glad to do it . it was no sacrifice at all .
I love Danny as much as he does , and I &apos;m just as happy as he is that Danny &apos;s doing so well .
but , after all , he &apos;s a cripple .
I &apos;m sorry . I didn &apos;t mean to say that . I &apos;m sure you didn &apos;t .
I didn &apos;t mean it . of course not .
I &apos;m afraid I haven &apos;t been too well myself lately .
Mrs. Harland , what do you want me to do ?
I want you to tell my husband that it would be better for Danny to stay here at Warm Springs .
it would be much better for him to go to Back of the Moon .
but surely it could do no harm for him to stay here or perhaps go back to school .
- And if you &apos;ll only tell my husband ... - Why don &apos;t you tell him ?
because coming from you ...
- Richard . - Hello , Doctor .
Oh , Richard , I &apos;ve got such wonderful news .
Dr. Mason has just consented to let Danny come with us to Back of the Moon .
Oh , no , darling , please . let me .
I want to be the first to tell him .
and this is Leick Thorne .
Hello ?
Yes . it &apos;s for you .
Hello ?
Oh , golly , Ellen .
we &apos;re going to Back of the Moon .
Yes , Ellen ?
when ?
tomorrow ?
Oh , gosh .
Yeah ?
gee , thanks , Ellen .
gosh .
good morning . good morning .
Oh , darling , I dreamed you were ...
what gives ?
another day with you .
Twenty-four hours with you .
good morning , Dick . Hey . good morning , Danny .
- Morning , Ellen . - Hi , Danny .
Hey !
- How about a dip in the lake before breakfast ? - Okay .
mornin &apos; , Miss Harland . Thorne !
- Who gets up first , you or the sun ?
- Mostly , it &apos;s neck and neck .
tell me if you &apos;d like to have me fix breakfast for you this morning .
Oh , no ! that &apos;s my job .
shucks , I &apos;m gonna feel sort of like a fifth wheel around here .
you mustn &apos;t feel like that . Richard considers you a part of the place .
you must &apos;ve been especially nice to him when he was a boy .
Oh , that wasn &apos;t hard . he was a nice kid .
you must &apos;ve had wonderful times together . Yep .
ton of &apos; em . did he change much when he got to be a young man ?
Mmm , not especially .
- Did he used to confide in you a lot ? - Yeah .
sometimes .
did he ever tell you about Enid Southern ?
- Who ?
- Enid Southern .
I don &apos;t especially recall he did . who was she ?
Oh , nobody in particular , I guess .
just school stuff .
I &apos;ll take those .
- Thorne , do you dream a lot ?
- Never .
I had the most awful nightmare last night .
we were out in the skiff , my husband and I , and he jumped in for a swim .
but I was too lazy , so I just rowed after him .
somehow , I was afraid , and when we got to the middle of the lake ,
I thought it was time for him to get back into the boat .
so I decided to call out to him , but I had no voice .
suddenly , Richard went under , not diving , but the way seals do , just sort of settling in the water .
then he came up again , and one of his arms flung out to me ... as if he were trying to call to me .
I tried to row to him , but the lake was like glue . the boat wouldn &apos;t move .
my arms were paralyzed .
then he went down again .
and this time he stayed down .
well , I reckon there &apos;s only one way left for you to save his life . - How ?
- For you to wake up .
that &apos;s just what I did .
Hey !
- Come and get it !
- Aw , come on in , Ellen !
the water &apos;s swell !
guess we &apos;d better go in .
okay , last one in &apos;s a sissy .
- Oh , no !
- &quot; No &quot; what ?
good grief . &quot; &apos; will you marry me ? &apos; he said . &quot;
what &apos;s wrong with that ?
in the first place , men never propose .
- They may think they do , but it &apos;s really the woman ... - Who told you that , Ripley ?
and if men do propose , they never say , &quot; Will you marry me ? &quot;
get away . get away , gadfly .
- Did you ever propose to a woman ? - Hundreds of &apos; em .
when you proposed to Enid Southern ...
who told you about Enid Southern ?
- Did you say , &quot; Will you marry me ? &quot; - I didn &apos;t propose to her .
- Did she propose to you ?
- Beat it , will you ?
how did you propose to me ?
- Uh , I ... - You didn &apos;t .
I proposed to you .
like this .
- Remember ?
- Okay , I &apos;ll marry you .
right after I finish my chapter .
I hate your chapter . I hate all your chapters .
they take up too much of your time .
- Funny thing , that &apos;s what my publisher says . - No , I &apos;m serious .
after all , it isn &apos;t as if you had to write for a living .
I &apos;ve got more than enough for both of us .
- And , darling , it &apos;s the dearest wish of my heart to support you . - It &apos;s that bad ?
Oh , darling , I didn &apos;t know it could be so wonderful here ...
back of the Moon . you like it here , do you ?
every minute . if only it weren &apos;t so crowded .
crowded ?
why , this is the most remote , uninhabited place east of the Mojave .
I mean the cabin . not that I mind chaperones , not in the least .
but there &apos;s Danny &apos;s room on one side of us and Thorne &apos;s room on the other side , and the wall &apos;s as thin as paper and the acoustics disgustingly perfect .
well , at least nobody snores .
do you know , ever since we &apos;ve been married , we &apos;ve never been alone , not for a single day ?
- And do you know that Thorne moved his cot and his things ... to the boathouse this morning ?
- He did ?
Oh , Richard , I hope you didn &apos;t tell him I ...
Oh , not at all . it was his own idea .
as far as Danny &apos;s concerned ... - Where is Danny ?
- He went with Thorne . - Where &apos;s Thorne ?
- He went to town . - You don &apos;t mean they &apos;re gonna stay in town ?
- Oh , certainly not . then why did they go ?
- Do you have to know everything ?
- Tell me .
- No . - Tell me !
- Cut it out !
- Tell me !
- Stop it . it &apos;s a secret . - You can &apos;t have any secrets from me .
we wanted to surprise you , honey .
come on .
- What was that ?
- Oh , that was a loon .
- There &apos;s a couple of &apos; em across the lake . - They sound horrible .
Oh , you &apos;ll get used to it . but wait till you see the deer . you &apos;ll love them .
they come right up to the cabin to be fed .
- What do you give them ?
- Potato peelings and salt .
- And then , of course , there &apos;s our porcupine . - Oh , yeah .
he used to come up every morning and nibble on the doorstep .
the Robies paid us a visit at Bar Harbor just before we left . are they well ?
- The children had the mumps . - Oh .
of course you &apos;ve heard about Russ Quinton being elected district attorney .
really ?
they say he &apos;s got his mind set on the governorship .
it wouldn &apos;t surprise me if he made it .
do you suppose we could find some wild wisteria ... and transplant it around the cabin ?
- I know where there &apos;s some .
Oh , fine . then tomorrow we ...
I &apos;m afraid Thorne won &apos;t have time for that .
he has his work to do .
look what I can do . Thorne showed me .
after all , Mother , you must remember Ellen didn &apos;t expect us .
we shouldn &apos;t have come , Ruth .
we shouldn &apos;t have come .
there must be a few loose bricks in the chimney .
I noticed it wasn &apos;t drawing very well .
did you hear me , darling ?
what happened tonight ?
ever since Ruth and your mother arrived , you &apos;ve been acting like a shrew .
at the landing , you were cold , at dinner , aloof and sullen , and after dinner , you were beastly .
they &apos;re your own people . I thought you &apos;d be pleased . don &apos;t let &apos;s quarrel , Richard .
and Danny adores you . you hurt him . why ?
I was upset .
you were insulting to your mother and mean to Thorne .
treated him like a servant . well , isn &apos;t he ?
certainly not !
he &apos;s a friend , one of my dearest friends .
is Ruth one of your dearest friends too ?
what &apos;s eating you ?
Ruth is your own sister . Ruth is not my sister .
all night long , you devoted yourself exclusively to her !
well , somebody had to make her welcome .
maybe you &apos;re in love with her . you &apos;re in a rotten mood , Ellen .
maybe that &apos;s why you invited her up here . Shh ! do you want her to hear you ?
I keep forgetting you can &apos;t draw a deep breath in this room without being heard all over the house .
let &apos;s change the name of the place from Back of the Moon to Goldfish Manor .
what &apos;s happened to you ?
you &apos;re deliberately whipping yourself into a fit of hysterics .
Oh , no , I mustn &apos;t do that . it might disturb Mother and Ruth or wake up Danny !
Ellen , what &apos;s got into you ?
I don &apos;t know .
I don &apos;t know .
Oh , darling , forgive me .
I &apos;m sorry .
I can &apos;t help it . it &apos;s only because I love you so .
I love you so , I can &apos;t bear to share you with anybody .
well , the gal with the hoe .
say , you &apos;re doing a swell job .
Oh , it &apos;s easy here . you just put things in the ground , and they grow .
it &apos;s much harder by the sea where we live .
Dick , when are you going to visit us at Bar Harbor ?
when I finish the book maybe . I think you &apos;ll like it there .
we were talking about it this morning ... Mother and I .
we thought it might be a good idea for Danny to go back with us when we leave .
the beach is lovely , and we have a sailboat .
he &apos;d have a wonderful time .
I &apos;m sure he would .
there &apos;s a school too , an excellent school .
Yes , I know . Ellen told me all about it .
I &apos;ll have a talk with Danny .
Dick , as far as I &apos;ve read , it &apos;s splendid .
Oh , well , just for that , I &apos;ll dedicate the book to you .
and what shall I say ? &quot; to my sweet , to my beautiful , my discerning mother-in-law &quot; ...
who advised me to dedicate this book to my wife .
I &apos;ll dedicate the next one to her .
you must dedicate them all to her .
I hope you &apos;ll send me the rest of the manuscript when it &apos;s finished .
Oh , there are only a few more chapters to write .
I &apos;ll probably wind it up before you leave here . that &apos;s hardly likely .
we &apos;re planning to leave on Saturday . on Saturday ?
but that &apos;s preposterous . you &apos;ve only been here a few days .
Yes , and they &apos;ve been wonderful days . Ruth and I shall never forget them .
but , really , there are reasons why I must be getting home .
- Does Ellen know you &apos;re leaving ?
- I told her this morning .
now , don &apos;t look so downcast , Dick .
you know , in a way , mothers-in-law are like children .
they should be seen and not heard .
and not seen too much .
what &apos;s wrong with Ellen ?
there &apos;s nothing wrong with Ellen .
it &apos;s just that she loves too much .
perhaps that isn &apos;t good . it makes outsiders of everyone else .
but she can &apos;t help it .
you must be patient with her .
she loved her father too much .
please , Danny , sit still . how do you expect me ... I can &apos;t help it .
you &apos;ll just love our house by the sea .
there are a lot of rocks on one side of the beach , and when it &apos;s low tide , you can go there and watch the anemones and the ink squids .
and there are the most wonderful shells and pebbles ... all sizes and colors .
sounds swell .
hold still .
how would you like to go to Bar Harbor for a while ?
I had a letter from Ruth , and she &apos;d love to have you . I &apos;d love to go .
- With Dick , you mean . - Well , no .
he doesn &apos;t want to leave here until the new book &apos;s finished , and then we can join you .
no , I &apos;d ... I &apos;d rather wait then ... until we can all go together ... the three of us .
we wouldn &apos;t be separated for long . just a few weeks .
no . I &apos;d ... I &apos;d rather wait .
can I swim all the way across today ?
think you can make it ?
why , sure .
I made it three-quarters yesterday , and I wasn &apos;t a bit tired .
all right . if I make it today , can we show Dick tomorrow ?
Yes . tomorrow .
and we don &apos;t have to tell him how long I &apos;ve been practicing , do we ?
no .
we can just pretend that you decided to do it on the spur of the moment .
Yeah . that &apos;s what we &apos;ll do . you know , I can just see him watching now .
after a while , he &apos;ll say , &quot; That &apos;s enough , Danny . better get back in the boat now . &quot;
and I &apos;ll just pretend like I didn &apos;t hear him and keep right on going .
are you ready ?
ready .
think you can make it , Danny ?
Aw , it &apos;s a cinch .
don &apos;t worry about your direction .
I &apos;ll keep you on your course .
okay .
are we halfway to the point yet ?
not yet .
you &apos;re not making very much progress , Danny .
are you all right ?
I &apos;m a little winded .
I had a kink in my side , but it &apos;s gone now .
you &apos;d better float for a while . Yeah .
I ... I think I &apos;m getting tired .
take it easy .
you don &apos;t want to give up when you &apos;ve come so far .
okay . I &apos;ll get my second wind in a minute .
the wa ... water &apos;s cold ... colder than I thought .
I ate too much lunch .
I got a stomachache . Ellen !
it &apos;s ... It &apos;s a cramp .
Ellen !
it &apos;s ... It &apos;s a cramp !
Ellen !
Ellen !
help me !
Danny !
Danny !
Danny !
I &apos;ve been cleaning Father &apos;s laboratory .
I thought it might be a good place for Dick to work .
he &apos;s dropped his work .
he &apos;s dropped everything .
I &apos;m losing him , Ruth . I &apos;ll die if I lose him .
perhaps if you went back to the lodge , just the two of you .
no . he hates it now ... everything about it .
he never wants to set foot there again .
and he doesn &apos;t want to go back to Boston .
if I only knew what he was thinking .
you &apos;ve always helped me , Ruth .
help me now .
a little time , Ellen . you &apos;ll see .
he &apos;s had a great loss . there &apos;s a great emptiness in his life .
if he only ... If he only had a child of his own .
Oh , it &apos;s wonderful .
when Ellen was a little girl , her father fixed this room up as a playroom for her .
then when she grew up , he used it as a laboratory .
now it &apos;s going to be a playroom again , just as it was before .
not exactly , Mother . your baby was a girl . ours is going to be a boy .
Oh , you &apos;ve decided that , have you ?
Oh , definitely .
Ellen gave me her word of honor . stand still , will you ?
I &apos;ve got a kink in my neck . dotted Swiss would be nice for the curtains .
what about the rug ?
you don &apos;t put rugs in children &apos;s playrooms .
you use linoleum . why ?
linoleum washes easily , just in case .
say , you women think of everything , don &apos;t you ?
- All right . you can rest . - Oh .
Ellen , you shouldn &apos;t have walked up those stairs .
you know what the doctor told you . darling , come here and sit down .
what have you done with Father &apos;s lab ?
we didn &apos;t want you to see it till it was finished .
- What have you done with his things ?
- We stored them in the basement .
why didn &apos;t you consult me ?
we wanted to surprise you . it &apos;s an ideal place for a playroom .
but I didn &apos;t want the room changed ever . I wanted it left just as it was .
I know you don &apos;t like being surprised , but we were only trying to please you .
come on , darling . everything &apos;s so wonderful now .
patchouli .
Hmm . you &apos;ll have to behave yourself .
imagine eating shrimps at a time like this .
where &apos;s Richard ?
he went to town .
they always upset you . I &apos;ve been telling you that for years .
- Did Ruth go with him ?
- Yes , I think so .
and especially now , in your condition . - When did they leave ?
- Right after lunch . and another thing ... Don &apos;t try to be so blamed athletic .
what time is it , Mother ?
almost 5 : 00 .
you &apos;ve gotta stop gadding about . &quot; Gadding &quot; ?
what are you talking about ?
this baby &apos;s making a prisoner out of me .
what are you having it for then ?
I can &apos;t do anything . I can &apos;t go anyplace .
I don &apos;t even see my husband . why don &apos;t you have him come in here ?
because I don &apos;t want him to see me this way . that doesn &apos;t make sense .
those are orders now ... no shrimps , no stairs .
and don &apos;t you budge off that couch .
Hey ! Oh !
Oh , my goodness !
get those , Ruth !
Oh !
Oh , heavens !
Hey !
Oh !
there . what are you doing ?
you look so funny . you should always wear your hat like that .
I missed you this afternoon .
what did you do when you went to town ?
Oh , we just shopped around for the baby things .
you were gone about four hours .
well , we walked to town and back .
rather a long walk , isn &apos;t it ?
tell me , what did you talk about ?
Oh , a lot of things .
about Danny ?
no .
about me . not especially .
you &apos;re looking very well , Ruth .
I &apos;ve never seen you so happy .
tell me , do you think Richard loves me ?
well , now , that &apos;s a silly thing to say .
Oh , I know , in the beginning , he loved me .
but I &apos;ll tell you something funny . he never liked me .
he loved you , but he never liked you ? that &apos;s right .
we &apos;ve never really been friends , like you and he .
he likes you .
tell me , has he found a nickname for you yet ?
sometimes he calls me the gal with the hoe ... to kid me about my gardening .
he used to call me Patchouli .
look at me .
I hate the little beast . I wish it would die . Ellen !
shocked , aren &apos;t you ?
if you were having the baby , you &apos;d love it .
well , I never wanted it .
Richard and I never needed anything else .
and now this . how can you say such wicked things ?
sometimes the truth is wicked .
you &apos;re afraid of the truth , aren &apos;t you , Ruth ? no .
you &apos;re the one who &apos;s afraid .
Ellen !
call the doctor .
what happened ?
she must have tripped .
Hello .
Dr. Saunders . this is Ruth Berent .
Yes , please come over at once . something terrible has happened .
well , we couldn &apos;t save the child .
it was a boy .
I ... I hadn &apos;t really hoped that ... As long as she &apos;s out of danger .
Oh , yes , you may rest assured of that .
when she came to , she remembered nothing about leaving her room .
she thought she must have been walking in her sleep .
she couldn &apos;t have been asleep . I was with her only 20 minutes before it happened .
you can go in and see her now for a moment if you like .
first his brother , and now his son .
Yes ?
no , she &apos;s not here at the moment .
I &apos;d be glad to take a message .
Yes , I will .
don &apos;t mention it .
Ruthie , my lass , the surf was wonderful .
you should &apos;ve come in for a dip .
too cold for me . you &apos;re a softy . you always were .
Mmm !
Richard &apos;s new book .
nice .
where is everybody ?
Dick &apos;s gone for a walk . mother &apos;s in her room .
I &apos;m worried about Mother these days , the way she keeps to her room .
- Isn &apos;t she well ?
- Perfectly well .
then why do you suppose she insists on acting like a hermit ?
- Why don &apos;t you ask her ?
- She won &apos;t talk to me .
I can &apos;t imagine what &apos;s come over her .
Oh , by the way , that phone call was for you .
somebody from the travel bureau in town .
said it was all right about the transportation and hotel reservation .
who &apos;s going places , and where ?
I am . Mexico .
well , why the wanderlust all of a sudden ?
I just thought I &apos;d like to get away for a while . from what ?
is there anything so strange about my wanting to take a trip ?
no , I suppose not . but why Mexico ?
I &apos;ve always wanted to see Mexico .
I &apos;ve never heard you say anything about it before .
what part of Mexico ?
Taxco .
when are you going ?
next week .
with Mother ? no .
by yourself ?
by myself .
what are you running away from ?
is it me ? Ellen , when we were kids , you used to torment me every way you could think of .
you can &apos;t do that anymore . is it Richard ?
if you must know , I &apos;m going away because I can &apos;t stand living in this house any longer .
the whole place is filled with hate ... your hate .
not hate . love , Ruth . Richard &apos;s love for me .
all these weeks I was in the hospital , helpless , you had him here in the house to yourself .
but it didn &apos;t do you any good , did it ?
he still loves me . he loves me more than ever .
that &apos;s what you can &apos;t abide . that &apos;s why you envy me , isn &apos;t it ?
I don &apos;t envy you , Ellen .
all my life , I &apos;ve tried to love you , done everything to please you .
all of us have ... Mother , Father and now Richard .
and what have you done ?
with your love , you wrecked Mother &apos;s life .
with your love , you pressed Father to death .
with your love , you &apos;ve made a shadow of Richard .
no , Ellen , I don &apos;t envy you .
I &apos;m sorry for you .
you &apos;re the most pitiful creature I &apos;ve ever known .
Hello , Richard .
have a nice walk ?
you haven &apos;t shaved , darling , but I &apos;ll forgive you .
your new book just came .
I &apos;ve been glancing through it . I noticed the dedication ... &quot; To the Gal with the Hoe . &quot;
I &apos;d hoped it would be &quot; To Patchouli . &quot;
but I suppose she did help you with it a lot .
Oh , well . there &apos;ll be other books .
darling , I had no idea the setting of your book was Mexico .
I didn &apos;t even know you &apos;d been there .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
is anything wrong , Richard ?
you look so strange .
you &apos;ve been avoiding me , going off by yourself .
where do you go ?
what do you think about ?
whatever it is , can &apos;t you share it with me ?
we haven &apos;t done that for a long time ... share things .
ever since Danny ...
you &apos;ve never forgiven me for that , have you ?
you &apos;ve always blamed me .
you did tell me not to let him swim the lake unless you were with us , but ... but we wanted to surprise you .
Danny was so happy planning to surprise you .
he &apos;d been doing so well .
he swam three-quarters the day before , and he was sure he could make it .
the water was so warm . I thought there was no danger .
I must have looked away for a moment , and then , when I looked back , Danny was sinking .
I pulled at the oars and then lost one .
and then I grew panicky . it was like a nightmare !
like ... walking in your sleep ?
Yes .
Yes . I began to paddle , and the boat didn &apos;t seem to move .
so you let him drown , didn &apos;t you ?
didn &apos;t you ?
Richard , you &apos;re hurting me .
what happened that day at Back of the Moon ?
you got rid of everybody else ... your mother , Ruth , Thorne .
there was only Danny left . what were you thinking of ?
you never really cared for him . you only pretended to .
what happened ?
did he refuse to leave ?
don &apos;t , Richard . don &apos;t . was that why you killed him ?
I didn &apos;t mean to let him drown . but you did , didn &apos;t you ?
you &apos;re a perfect swimmer , and the boat was so far away , and he was going down for the third time .
you killed him . you let Danny drown , didn &apos;t you ?
didn &apos;t you ?
Yes . Yes , I did .
I let him drown , and I &apos;d do it again .
I didn &apos;t want him around . I didn &apos;t want anyone but you .
I knew it .
I must have known it all along .
I kept pushing it out of my mind .
I couldn &apos;t believe it .
I didn &apos;t want to believe it .
how could I ?
you loved me , you said . wanted only to make me happy .
Yes , that was all I ever wanted , Richard ... your happiness , only that .
I didn &apos;t mean to let Danny drown .
I didn &apos;t plan it . I swear I didn &apos;t .
but when the cramp caught him and he went under , I thought , if he never came up again ,
I &apos;d have you all to myself .
I thought , if he was gone , you &apos;d have only me .
then suddenly , while I was thinking that , he was gone .
I was sorry then and frightened , and I tried to find him .
tried , honestly ... tried hard . but it was too late .
why don &apos;t you kill me , Richard ?
you could so easily , you know .
and the baby .
you never wanted it , did you ?
no . Oh , don &apos;t you see , Richard ?
I didn &apos;t want anyone around .
only you . I wanted to be just with you . I couldn &apos;t stand having anyone between us .
Oh , I love you so , Richard .
I love you so .
I &apos;m leaving you , Ellen .
Mr. Russell ...
Quinton ,
district ...
attorney ,
Sussex ...
flight 17 , the Sunset Special , now loading at Gate 7 .
Mr. Richard Harland wanted at the telephone .
inquire at Information .
I &apos;m Richard Harland . use the phone number one .
thank you .
Hello .
Yes , this is ...
what ?
well , how ... how did it happen ?
Oh , yes , of course . I &apos;ll take the first train back .
Dr. Saunders , I &apos;m sorry to get you out of bed , but she &apos;s much worse .
would you hold on for just a minute , please ?
Oh , Dick . thanks .
where is she ?
in her room .
it happened very suddenly . we were having a picnic lunch at the beach .
doctor , it seems to be more serious than you thought .
could you come at once , please ?
Richard .
I &apos;m going to die . don &apos;t talk like that , Ellen . you &apos;re going to be all right .
no .
and you mustn &apos;t feel sorry for me .
I &apos;m not afraid .
only ... Only promise me one thing .
I ...
I want to be cremated ... like my father ... and my ashes scattered in the same place .
- Remember ?
- I remember .
promise ?
of course , Ellen .
I &apos;ll promise anything you like , only ... Richard !
I &apos;ll never let you go , Richard .
never .
murder . cold , brutal , premeditated murder .
the State will prove that , on the afternoon of September 5 , at a picnic attended by Ellen Harland , her mother and her adopted sister , that Ellen met death as a result of poisoning .
the State will prove that the sugar with which Ellen that day sweetened her coffee ... was mixed with poison ... and that she met death by reason of that poison .
the State will prove that the defendant had both motive and opportunity ... to commit this dreadful crime .
and the State will prove that the defendant , Ruth Berent , deliberately and maliciously plotted ... and carried through the murder .
it &apos;ll be all right .
I refer now to the envelope found in the defendant &apos;s leather jacket .
when you analyzed the contents of this envelope , what did you find ?
the apparent sugar tested 60 % arsenic .
shortly after you made this test , I came to you with a sealed parcel .
Yes , sir . the contents was a bottle half full of white powder .
I show you the bottle .
that &apos;s it .
you analyzed the contents ? I did .
what was it ?
pure arsenic .
your witness , Mr. Robie .
uh , no questions .
Mr. Medcraft , you are the manager of the Bay State Mortuary .
I am . were the remains of the late Mrs. Ellen Harland cremated at your establishment ?
Yes , sir .
- Who made the arrangements ?
- Miss Ruth Berent .
- Your witness . - Uh , no questions , Mr. Quinton .
Mr. Carlson , what is your occupation ?
vice president of the Seaboard Trust Company .
your bank is trustee for the estate of the late Ellen Berent Harland ?
Yes , sir . when was the last time that you saw Mrs. Harland ?
just after she got out of the hospital .
did she make any provision in her will about being cremated after her death ?
no , she did not .
would you tell the jury what provision she did make ?
she requested that she be buried in the family vault at Mount Auburn Cemetery .
Hello , Dick .
Hello . good evening . good evening , dear .
tomorrow , Dick , you &apos;ll go on the witness stand .
just remember that Quinton isn &apos;t just the prosecutor .
you may rest assured he &apos;ll have his brass knuckles on .
he &apos;ll throw the whole book at you .
he &apos;ll ask you some questions that won &apos;t be easy to answer ... one in particular .
do you swear to tell the truth , the whole truth and nothing but the truth , so help you God ?
I do .
your name ?
Richard Harland .
your profession ?
writer .
if you don &apos;t mind , Mr. Harland , I shall ask you , for a moment , to be a reader .
I have been asked how I happened to investigate the death of Mrs. Harland .
this letter is my answer .
I ask you to read it .
- Aloud ?
- Please .
&quot; dear Russ ,
I &apos;m writing this letter to you ... because we once meant a great deal to each other ... and there &apos;s no one else to whom I can go for help .
Richard is leaving me . &quot;
proceed , please , Mr. Harland .
&quot; it was after I left the hospital I first began to sense a change in my husband .
at first , I thought it might be due to the loss of our child , and then the truth , the awful truth , began to dawn on me .
the reason for the change was Ruth .
Russ , they love each other and want to get rid of me .
when Richard suggested a divorce ,
I went to Ruth and begged her to give him up .
she said she intended to have him and would stop at nothing .
I told Ruth I would never give Richard a divorce , and it was then that she threatened to kill me . &quot;
go on , Mr. Harland .
&quot; Russ , I know she means it and is capable of it .
she will kill me the first chance she gets . &quot;
if you don &apos;t mind , Mr. Harland , will you read that last paragraph a little louder ?
&quot; she will kill me the first chance she gets . &quot;
go on , Mr. Harland .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid to stay in the house , but I can &apos;t leave without Richard .
I &apos;d rather die than give him up .
I don &apos;t know what to do or where to turn except to you , Russ .
please help me . Ellen . &quot; Mr. Harland , do you identify the handwriting in this letter ?
Yes . Ellen &apos;s . I call your attention to the first sentence .
&quot; I am writing this letter to you because we once meant a great deal to each other . &quot;
do you know the significance of this ?
I suppose it refers to the fact that you once were engaged to her .
Yes . we were once engaged . did you know that when you first met her ?
she was wearing an engagement ring .
- You knew when you met her that she was engaged to another man . - Yes .
- And in spite of that , you made love to her . - I suppose so .
would you tell the jury about this courtship ?
I didn &apos;t exactly court her .
- You mean that she courted you ?
- No , not that either .
then what do you mean ?
I knew that she &apos;d marry me if I asked her to .
- And so you decided to ask her .
- No . I decided not to .
- Did she ask you ?
- Not exactly .
well , then how did you happen to get married ?
well , I found one day that she had removed her engagement ring .
she gave me to understand ...
I realized then that I was in love with her .
- Did you tell her so ? - Yes .
what did she say ?
she said she would never let me go .
how soon after this were you married ?
a couple of days later . she wanted it that way .
were you reluctant ?
I was doubtful .
now , Mr. Harland , I don &apos;t say this critically , nor in mockery , nor to suggest that you are conceited , but simply to be sure that I understand you correctly .
you suggest that a beautiful young woman engaged to another man ... falls in love with you , wins you and persuades you into a quick marriage ... against your better judgment .
is that a fair statement of the facts ? - Yes .
- I see .
now , how soon after this did you begin to regret your surrender ?
- Were you happy with your wife for the first month ?
- Completely . - The second , the third , the fourth ?
- Yes .
was Ruth at the ranch in New Mexico during the time Ellen met and courted you ?
- Yes . - Did you see much of Ruth at this time ?
- No . - Where did you go after you left New Mexico ?
to Warm Springs , Georgia , to visit my brother , Danny .
during your residence in Warm Springs , did you have any servants ?
no .
- Who did the housework ?
- Ellen . - And the cooking ?
- Ellen .
- You couldn &apos;t afford any servants .
- It wasn &apos;t a question of afford . she preferred it that way .
- Ellen liked doing things for you .
- Yes . - Did Ruth come to visit you during this time ?
- No . where did you go after you left Warm Springs ?
to a fishing lodge I have at a place called Back of the Moon .
- Did anyone come with you ?
- My brother , Danny .
- When was that ?
- In June .
- In June , were you still happy with your wife ?
- Yes .
- How about July ? - Yes .
you loved her in July .
how about August ?
- Did anyone come to visit you in August ?
- Mrs. Berent .
- Anybody else ?
- Ruth .
you loved Ellen in August .
well , how about August ?
my brother was drowned in August .
I know how that must have saddened you , but did it affect your love for Ellen ?
- Danny meant a lot to me . - So did Ellen .
Yes . Danny was drowned in August .
come to September . did your love for Ellen continue in September ?
- In a different way . - In what different way ?
we were to have a baby .
you mean that your love for Ellen increased because she was going to have a baby .
no , not exactly . did it grow less ?
- I don &apos;t know . - Then what do you mean by &quot; in a different way &quot; ?
I don &apos;t know .
during this time , you were living in Bar Harbor at the Berent home ? - Yes .
- And Ruth was there all the time .
- Your wife was confined to her room . - A good part of the time .
- Did you see a great deal of Ruth during this time ? - Yes .
- Practically every day .
when did you stop loving Ellen ?
I don &apos;t know .
isn &apos;t it true that shortly before your wife died , you quarreled with her ?
- Yes . - What about ? - I can &apos;t say .
- Wasn &apos;t it because Ellen was jealous of Ruth ?
- She had no reason to be . - Wasn &apos;t she ?
- Ellen was jealous of everybody . - But was she jealous of Ruth ?
- I refuse to answer that . - Then perhaps you &apos;ll answer this .
- Are you in love with Ruth ?
- We &apos;re very good friends .
- Are you in love with her ? - I &apos;m very fond of her .
I want you to answer yes or no .
I &apos;m asking you a very simple question .
perhaps you didn &apos;t understand me . I shall repeat it for you .
are you in love with Ruth ?
are you in love with Ruth ?
are you in love with Ruth ?
I hand you a copy of Richard Harland &apos;s new book .
kindly turn to the dedication page .
would you please read the dedication ? &quot; to the Gal with the Hoe . &quot;
- To whom does that refer ?
- To me .
isn &apos;t it rather strange that Mr. Harland didn &apos;t dedicate his new book to his wife ?
I don &apos;t think Ellen was very much interested in the book .
but you were . Yes , very much . - You worked with him on it .
- On the final draft , yes .
- That was written while Ellen was in the hospital , wasn &apos;t it ?
- Yes .
you were together a great deal during the time Ellen was in the hospital .
- Well , we were ... - Working on the book .
Yes . will you tell the jury where most of the action in this book takes place ?
Taxco , Mexico .
- Had you ever been to Mexico before ?
during all the time that you lived with the Berent family , had you ever gone away on a trip before alone ?
- No .
- Why did you decide to go to Taxco ? - I wanted to get away .
- Did you expect to meet anybody there that you knew ?
did you expect to be joined there by anybody you knew ?
- No .
- Did Mr. Harland suggest that you go to Taxco ?
no . let &apos;s get back to the dedication .
why did Mr. Harland refer to you as &quot; the gal with the hoe &quot; ?
well , I &apos;m rather fond of gardening .
- You did all of the gardening . - Yes .
- Did you ever use any chemical sprays or insecticides ?
- Yes .
any containing arsenic , for example ?
I don &apos;t know .
I show you a bottle here in evidence . do you recognize it ?
Yes . it was mine . it held bath salts .
- Are you aware of what it contains now ?
- Yes . by what chemical process do you suppose ... that bath salts turned into poison ?
- I don &apos;t know .
I show you a leather jacket here in evidence .
do you recognize it ?
- Yes , it &apos;s mine . - I show you an envelope here in evidence .
- Do you recognize it ? - Yes .
it &apos;s the envelope containing the sugar .
- Which the state chemist testified was 60 % arsenic ... - Yes .
and which the sheriff testified was found in the pocket of this leather jacket .
- Yes . - Did you wear this jacket on the day of the picnic ?
for a while , yes . then I gave it to Ellen to wear .
- Why did you do that ?
- She complained of feeling chilly .
- And so you loaned her the jacket . - Yes .
will you tell the jury who prepared the food in the picnic hamper ?
- Ellen and I. - Who prepared the sugar ?
I don &apos;t know . it must have been Ellen . why do you think it was Ellen ?
she was the only one who took sugar with her coffee .
- Who served the coffee on the day of the picnic ?
- I did . - And you gave her the sugar ?
- Yes .
- And that night , she was dead . - Yes .
- And the very next day , her body was cremated . - Yes .
and the following day , Harland left with the ashes for the ranch in New Mexico ... to dispose of them there ...
- Yes . so that no autopsy could be possible .
no , no . that wasn &apos;t the reason .
Ellen always wanted to be cremated and to have her ashes scattered with those of her father .
then why did she take the trouble to have a clause inserted in her will ... requesting that she be buried in Mount Auburn ?
- I can &apos;t explain it . - There are a great many things you can &apos;t explain .
you can &apos;t explain how the poison got in the bottle of bath salts .
you can &apos;t explain how it got in the sugar .
you can &apos;t explain why Ellen &apos;s body was cremated so as to make an autopsy impossible .
you can &apos;t explain why you made plans to leave this country ... shortly before your sister was poisoned .
well , perhaps you can explain this !
when did you first fall in love with Richard Harland ?
- Did you ever tell him that you loved him ?
when did you fall in love with him ?
you &apos;ve dodged long enough .
you can answer a simple question , and I demand that you do so !
just when did you fall in love with Richard Harland ?
did you love him after his brother , Danny , was drowned ?
did you love him after the death of his stillborn child , after his wife died ?
did you love him last week , a month before , a year before ?
are you in love with him today ?
Yes . Yes , I am in love with him .
I think I &apos;ve always loved him .
the State recalls Richard Harland to the stand .
that &apos;s all .
get some water , please !
order in the court !
Richard Harland , you heard that woman finally tell the truth , and now I want the truth out of you .
you heard Ruth Berent confess her love for you .
and now I ask you , as I have asked you over and over , time and again ... are you in love with her ?
are you in love with the woman who murdered your wife ?
my wife was not murdered . she killed herself .
- Do you honestly believe Ellen committed suicide ?
knowing her as you did and I did , you think her capable not only of committing suicide ... but falsely accusing her own sister of her death ?
Ellen was capable of anything .
you actually want the jury to believe that she was that sort of monster ?
Yes , she was that sort of monster ... a woman who sought to possess everything she loved , who loved only for what it could bring her , whose love estranged her own father and mother , whose love possessed her father until he couldn &apos;t call his soul his own ,
who , by her own confession to me , killed my brother , killed her own unborn child ...
and who is now reaching from the grave to destroy her innocent sister .
Yes , she was that sort of monster .
order in the court !
I can &apos;t believe it .
it took the jury only 10 minutes to bring in a verdict of not guilty for Ruth .
but Harland had sacrificed himself .
in withholding knowledge of Ellen &apos;s crime , he &apos;d become an accessory .
he got two years .
but Ellen had lost .
I guess it &apos;s the only time she didn &apos;t come out first .
I guess Dick &apos;s about home , now .
we should have stayed in Paris .
that &apos;s where we belong .
I was born here . I have every right to come here .
they &apos;ll make you trouble like they did for your mama .
I &apos;ll make them trouble .
crazy talk .
change your mind , miss Clio .
we &apos;ll go directly to mama &apos;s house on rampart street- my house now .
charcoal , charcoal my mule is white my charcoal is black i &apos;ll sell my charcoal two bits a sack charcoal , charcoal charcoal
let &apos;s go ... and come back some other time .
ghosts in there .
if there is , it &apos;s my father &apos;s , and i &apos;d like to see him .
poor mama .
her beautiful garden- mimosa , camellias , and crape myrtle .
that &apos;s the kitchen and upstairs where Cupidon and i lived .
often your papa and mama had dinner in the garden .
he loved his fine food .
it was so beautiful in the moonlight .
and the little house ?
the garconniere .
remember , i told you your papa was sure , sure you were gonna be a boy , so he built it for you to live in with your nurse , like all the other fine families in New Orleans .
he must have been disappointed with me .
he just turned it into a stable , but he loved you , baby .
he &apos;d toss you in the air and call you his little , small angel .
honey , baby , don &apos;t go in .
hysterical . slap her-hard .
don &apos;t , cherie .
Ah !
thank you , Angelique .
I &apos;m all right now .
it was that sofa with one leg off .
it looks so crazy and frowzy and dirty , just like that old woman who used to limp along the quay in Paris selling fish .
my poor , dead , darling baby .
you should have seen her as she sat on it in her silks and jewels .
it was right there that lawyer , Mr. Osie , told her your papa had been forced to marry with one of those high-up aristocrat like himself .
my little Rita , she don &apos;t believe .
she hope he marry with her .
they always hope- ladies like her .
but it never happens , oh , no .
didn &apos;t my father tell her ?
did he leave it to his lawyer ?
he come as soon as he could , but that was a very bad thing that he come .
very , very bad .
light up there !
don &apos;t go up there . do you hear me ?
my father &apos;s blood .
I saw it spurting like the fountains of the seine .
and your mama kneeling there screaming .
Shh !
let him be . I want to hear it .
she was trying to kill herself , your mama .
he grabbed the gun , that poor boy .
they said she murdered him .
they sent her away .
she meant that to be her blood .
don &apos;t touch it .
my father &apos;s blood , my blood .
they are the same .
I love it- this spot .
I &apos;ll sleep here tonight- in this room .
no .
tonight and every night .
I &apos;m going to fix this house and live in it .
I &apos;ll show them , these pasty-faced aristocrats .
I am not my mother , to be sent away and turned into an ugly , broken-hearted woman and made an exile even after she was dead .
let them find out there &apos;s someone in rampart street now who &apos;s not afraid of them .
Clio Dulaine , that &apos;s me .
I &apos;m as good as they are .
I &apos;m better than they are .
I &apos;ll be richer than they .
I &apos;ll be grander than they .
I shall marry and be very rich and respectable , not like mama .
Oh , nonsense .
you &apos;ll be a fool about men just like your poor mama and your grandma vaudray and your great-grandma bonavie .
I won &apos;t , i tell you .
men will be fools about me .
your mama was a plaise .
all she knew was to please a man .
your grandma was a- i &apos;m a Dulaine .
my father was nicholas Dulaine .
my life will be different .
I will have fun and i will have money .
horses and a carriage !
and jewels by the quarts and fine clothes and anything i want !
how are you gonna get those ?
with the money of my very rich husband .
and where &apos;s he ?
I &apos;ll meet him .
and everything they did to my mama i &apos;ll do back to them- every little thing .
I &apos;ll do it twice .
do all that for your mama ?
that &apos;s good . well , partly i &apos;ll do it for mama .
partly i &apos;ll do it for me .
chimney sweep ladies , i know why the old chimney won &apos;t draw .
don &apos;t want to bake and you can &apos;t make no cake and i know why your chimney won &apos;t draw chimney sweep
chimney sweep chimney sweep
Hey , shorty , do you come from France , like they say ?
I come from New Orleans .
not like you , congo .
is you going to stay here ?
what you think , we &apos;re carpetbaggers like you ?
now i know what mama meant .
you remember , she used to say there was an old louisiana proverb-
&quot; give a creole a crystal chandelier
&quot; and two mirrors to reflect it , and he is satisfied . &quot;
I got the chandelier , and i &apos;ve got two mirrors , but i &apos;m not satisfied .
who &apos;s creole here ?
I am .
I am creole .
take shame on yourself , denying your own mama .
don &apos;t you dare .
that &apos;s a lie .
Angelique buiton , you listen to me , and you , too , Cupidon .
do you want to stay with me ?
where else ?
well , then remember , no matter what i say i am , that i am .
I don &apos;t want to hear any more of this telling me who i am and what i am to do .
do as i say , and we &apos;ll be rich .
which do you choose ?
stay or go ? stay .
Playacting , just like her great-grandma .
where are we going all dressed up ?
first we &apos;ll go to the french market .
we &apos;ll buy everything , everything delicious .
shrimps ?
and soft-shell crab ?
then the saint louis cathedral , then madame begue &apos;s for breakfast .
those Dulaines eat there .
mama said they sometimes did on sunday mornings .
always .
I found out . they go to church , too . I found out everything .
good , cupid .
now we fix those Dulaines .
you wouldn &apos;t do that ?
Oh , wouldn &apos;t i ?
Angelique , do you think they &apos;ll recognize me ?
do i look enough like mama ?
not half so beautiful .
young scrawny like you .
hah , an old crow like you .
perhaps it will be just as well if at first they &apos;re not sure .
perhaps i &apos;ll not even use my name of Dulaine at first .
you sure those police ain &apos;t after you ?
I &apos;ll be a ...
who shall i be ? you &apos;re acting just like your grandma .
I &apos;ll be a comtesse .
I am la comtesse de Trignonai du Chenfrais .
and i &apos;m the Queen of Spain .
and i &apos;m the Emperor Napoleon .
boo !
blackberries fresh and fine i got blackberries , ladies .
fresh from the vine .
I got blackberries
America is lovely .
it &apos;s swell and lovely .
Mmm .
Ah .
boo !

do you see them ?
no .
not yet . are you sure ?
no , i could not forget them .
Merci .
lady , can i dance for you ?
thank you , ma &apos;am .
Oh , what a heavenly smell .
Jambalaya .
Jambalaya- that mama wished for in Paris and couldn &apos;t get ?
Oh , i want some .
Oh , heavy stuff , you &apos;ll ruin your breakfast at begue &apos;s .
you know i have the appetite of a dock worker .
quick cupid , tell the man a heaping plate for madame la comtesse .
for who ?
you heard ! for madame la comtesse . who else , stupid ?
Hey , you .
a dish of this stuff for madame la comtesse .
for whom ?
for madame la comtesse .
who else ? but certainly .
certainement .
is it as good as they &apos;ve told me in France ?
I await your judgment .
Mmm .
delicieux .
delicious .
Mmm .
excellent .
wonderful .
Madame la comtesse says the dish is delicious .
it is more delicious than anything she has eaten in Paris .
hash . Phooey .
Ah , tres bien . bravo , madame la comtesse .
bravo .
you &apos;re so quiet all at once , eh ?
now what &apos;s happened ?
Hmm ?
don &apos;t pretend innocent with me .
I see the look in your eye .
don &apos;t you try fooling with- stop nudging me , you wicked old woman .
I &apos;m not a child . I &apos;ll go when i please .
I see him , that big lug leaning there , that Texas .
you going to the cathedral , and it should be for confession .
of course , Angelique . Cupidon , take the marketing home .
stay with us until we &apos;re safe .
do whatever will please the old crow .
Oh , what a lovely chou- fleur .
still there .
who , Angelique ?
who ?
&quot; who , Angelique ?
who , Angelique ! &quot; you and your cauliflower head - you &apos;re two of a kind .
we &apos;ll now go to the cathedral .
Cupidon , go home with your basket and meet us later at begue &apos;s .
we &apos;ll ride .
I &apos;m tired . it &apos;s hot . I &apos;m hungry .
Yes , ma &apos;am .
nice time for a ride out to the lake .
ma &apos;am .
I hate to see anybody as plum beautiful as you riding in a moth-eaten old basket like this , let alone those two nags a- pulling &apos; it .
if you &apos;ll do me the honor of riding in my carriage ... i &apos;m driving a pair of long-tailed bays to the runabout .
brought them all the way from Texas , and they &apos;re beauties , and they &apos;re thoroughbreds , just like- well , that sounds terrible , but i don &apos;t mean to compare you , ma &apos;am , to a-
but if you &apos;ll allow me , ma &apos;am , I-
I &apos;ll , uh , i &apos;ll set down this cup of coffee .
I ain &apos;t gonna let you do it . do you hear me ?
I ain &apos;t gonna let you do it .
beautiful .
I think he &apos;s beautiful .
Ah ! I &apos;ll punish him .
Allez .
vite , vite . I &apos;ll take him and lock him up with the savages .
I &apos;ll lock him up on bread and water .
so madame la comtesse enjoys talking to loutish cowboys ?
I didn &apos;t talk to him .
he talked to me .
even your aunt bess- shut up !
do you want me to slap you right here on the street ?
I wish i could die now .
your mama made me promise to take care of you , but it &apos;s no use .
common , common dirt ! Ah , shh .
if you please , pay attention to your prayers , not to someone who ain &apos;t there .
I &apos;m only looking for those Dulaines .
the Dulaines don &apos;t wear 90-gallon hats .
here we is , ladies- the famous begue &apos;s .
all the quality eats here .
Whoa . what are you dressed up coachman for ?
you look like a monkey on a string .
we got horses , haven &apos;t we ?
packed some of my Paris stuff from home .
I &apos;ll fix up these nags yet .
splendid , Cupidon .
I &apos;ll tell you what , it &apos;s too late for begue &apos;s- oh , no .
we ain &apos;t gonna drive around to be seen and followed by that Texas .
wait here . pay the man and come on , cupid .
and if a cowboy in a white hat comes along , we ain &apos;t here .
it would serve you right if he had Cupidon brought into court as a billy goat .
not for him-courtrooms .
I know the looks .
probably wanted in Texas himself and skipped out with somebody &apos;s carriage and horses .
Oh , Angelique , don &apos;t let &apos;s quarrel anymore .
I meant it to be such a happy day .
all right , baby , we don &apos;t quarrel , but just you keep your mind on what you came out for .
and remember , 20 years ago , your mama walked in here like a queen .
Bonjour , madame- but ... no .
for a moment i thought you were- but , of course , it isn &apos;t possible .
I &apos;ve heard my mother speak of you often , monsieur begue .
they say i resemble her .
I &apos;m la comtesse de Trignonai du Chenfrais .
of course .
of course . this way , if you please .
Oh , i am so sorry , madame .
this table is reserved every sunday morning for the family of Dulaine .
splendid .
they &apos;d be delighted . a relative , you know .
I want everything that you &apos;re famous for- you and madame begue .
all the delicious things mama used to describe to me in Paris .
she spoke of my food in Paris ?
Ah . Leon .
may i suggest , perhaps , madame begue &apos;s renowned crawfish bisque ?
Oh , mais non .
Enchante .
c &apos;est magnifique .
c &apos;est delicieux .
je prepare everything with my own hands pour vous , madame la comtesse .
is it ?
Cupidon , my fan .
Bonjour , madame begue .
we are late . I trust everything isn &apos;t gone .
don &apos;t stare , ninnies .
will they recognize me , do you think ?
shall i speak to them ?
shall i say to that girl ,
&quot; Hello , sister &quot; ?
she &apos;s my half sister .
Ah , madame Dulaine .
Bonjour . Bonjour , madame .
but she said , ah , she &apos;s a relative .
but she said that- who &apos;s that at our table , mama ?
what are they doing ?
leaving .
keep quiet .
come . we will go .
stay where you are .
I &apos;m not leaving . first folks in a hurry i &apos;ve seen in New Orleans .
is this begue &apos;s ?
it was begue &apos;s .
is he coming ?
going right by .
not looking , either .
Hey , cookie .
now , while he ain &apos;t looking , come , baby .
I &apos;m not nearly finished .
I &apos;m going to have an omelet souffle , and after that some strawberries with thick cream .
Yeah , burst your corset .
stuff yourself .
with a figure like a cow , you &apos;ll get yourself a fine husband . Oh , yes .
or maybe you &apos;ve already picked that Texas vache .
he &apos;s used to bulging sides .
Texas , Texas . what do i care where he &apos;s from ?
I &apos;m not even looking at him .
well , do look , then .
can &apos;t read the menu even .
what &apos;s all this stuff ?
where i come from , we write our menus in american .
beef and beans- that &apos;s what he &apos;s used to .
even leon is amused .
kind of steamy here in New Orleans .
oui , monsieur .
if he were mine , i would have for him four-dozen white handkerchiefs of the finest linen , and you would embroider his initials in the most delicate scrolls .
me ?
embroider for that cowboy ?
he &apos;s never even seen a white linen handkerchief .
and linen , too , for his shirts , i think .
fine pleated linen .
and his initials on them , too .
initials . initials .
what initials ? his initials , whatever they are .
I don &apos;t know what the devil those rognons are , but i &apos;ll take a chance .
oui , monsieur .
they say everything here is licking &apos; good .
psst .
now what are you gonna you do ?
Leon , tell monsieur seated over there- the gentleman with the big hat and boots- if he &apos;s having difficulty in choosing his breakfast , i &apos;ll be happy to assist him .
ask him if he wouldn &apos;t perhaps prefer to be served at my table .
we &apos;re old friends .
quickly .
common .
common as dirt . keep quiet , Angelique , or i &apos;ll send you away somewhere to starve .
fellow over there told me that you said- won &apos;t you sit down ?
Angelique , wait in the hall .
Cupidon , bring the gentleman &apos;s hat from the other table .
then you wait in the hall , too .
say , thanks .
back where i come from , we kind of like to stay close to our hats on account of not knowing when we might have to pull out of a place right quick .
forgive me , but you look so big sitting there .
as far as that goes , you look kind of funny yourself , ma &apos;am , with that white stuff on your face .
Voila , madame .
Oh , wonderful .
please serve monsieur , too .
Oh , i see .
I don &apos;t know what we &apos;re laughing at , but i haven &apos;t had as much fun in a coon &apos;s age .
down in Texas , they told me people were standoffish in New Orleens .
new Orleans .
fixing to learn me the english language ?
teach .
there .
this is the famous ragout du rognons , especially prepared by monsieur begue &apos;s own hands .
have you got any ketchup ?
ketchup .
in Paris now , everything is eaten with ketchup .
it &apos;s the chic thing for dinner in Paris .
ketchup for monsieur .
ha ha ha !
and when they brought you monsieur begue &apos;s ragout de rognons with a sauce prepared for days and days by monsieur begue &apos;s own magical hands , you ask for ketchup !
ha ha ha !
Frenchy , i can &apos;t figure you out .
is that why you whip your horses ?
besides , i &apos;m not french .
I &apos;m american . I was brought up in France .
I &apos;m la comtesse de Trignonai du Chenfrais .
Oh , you don &apos;t say ?
well , honey , just to prove i &apos;m playing square with you , i &apos;ll tell you my real name .
Clint Maroon .
now tell me yours .
Clint Maroon . do you hear that , Angelique ?
the initials are c.m .
Whoa .
won &apos;t you come in ?
Hey , what kind of a game is this , anyway ?
look , honey , i was born in Texas , but it wasn &apos;t yesterday .
I told you .
Hey , hold on .
there &apos;s no cause of getting riled .
he ain &apos;t there .
who isn &apos;t ?
you know who .
he &apos;s been there every day for a week pawing the ground worse than his horses , but he ain &apos;t there today .
go away someplace .
I will .
go , then !
I &apos;m going . I &apos;d like to go to Paris , France .
you have my permission .
I &apos;d like to see voodoo woman .
I &apos;d spell that cowboy into more trouble than he ever dreamed of !
shame !
Cupidon ?
huh ?
what you want ?
like some cake ?
Baba au rum , make it fresh today .
like another piece ?
you want something .
tomorrow i fix you creme brulee or le ta de mer a la creme .
you do want something .
I find letter today in the hall .
I guess must be there many years hiding itself .
what &apos;s it say ?
read it .
heh heh heh !
why you tear that ?
what does it say ?
I like that big cowboy from Texas .
he is a beautiful- to know about horses- yesterday i heard he won $ 1,000 at the racetrack .
at night , he gambles on royal street .
at number 18 , they say never loses .
have you been talking ?
no , but i just might .
ha ha ha !
what does it say , you macaque , you ?
crazy about her .
going to bust the house down .
I knew it .
only bad happens to us in New Orleans .
what do you know ?
this is fine here in America .
don &apos;t you bother your head about little Clio .
she knows her way about .
anyway , i &apos;m sick of only women in the house .
man around , suit me fine .
Oh , you little ... you going out ?
I didn &apos;t come to New Orleans to sit in dignified seclusion in my house .
I &apos;m going ... i &apos;m going to church .
why ?
because it &apos;s sunday .
la la la la la
what kind of language is that ?
Gumbo , cheri-
new Orleans french flavored with african .
what does that say in american ?
if you was a bird , suzette and i was a gun martinet i will shoot you down , sure i will shoot you dead oh , my dear mahogany jewel .
I love you .
I love you like a pig love the mud .
and i will shoot you dead da dee da la da da da da da da la la la la la mm mm mm da da
a house isn &apos;t a house unless it has about it the scent of a good cigar .
where &apos;d you hear that ?
where ? mama used to say that , poor darling .
Oh , she did , huh ?
look , this stuff you &apos;ve been telling me- is it true ?
I don &apos;t mean that stuff about being a countess .
I mean ... well , sometimes you talk like a schoolgirl- ask Angelique .
ask Cupidon .
those two ? they &apos;d lie for you no matter what .
well , if you think i &apos;m lying ,
Angelique is lying , Cupidon is lying , why don &apos;t you go back to that little lady in Texas you always been talking about ?
the one who made you that white satin tie embroidered with blue forget-me-nots .
what &apos;s the matter with that tie ?
you &apos;re not jealous , are you ? it &apos;s terrible .
tell me about her- the finest little lady in the world .
blue eyes , you said , and golden hair , and so little , she only comes up to there .
how nice .
when are you going to marry , you two ?
I don &apos;t aim to marry anybody .
I go it alone , and i &apos;m out for big game .
I &apos;ll marry .
I &apos;ll marry a husband very , very rich and very respectable .
I &apos;ll be the best man at your wedding .
why not ?
no , you &apos;ll be far too handsome .
all the guests would wonder why i hadn &apos;t married you .
very , very rich and respectable men are so rarely handsome .
then , one can &apos;t have everything .
where i come from , women are two kinds .
they &apos;re good or they &apos;re bad .
what kind of a woman are you ?
well ... on my father &apos;s side , i &apos;m very , very good- prim , you might say , and very respectable .
on my mother &apos;s side , i &apos;m ... how shall i say that for your tender ears ?
sometimes i &apos;m mama , who gave everything for love ... sometimes i &apos;m my grandmama vaudray , who gave everything , too , but not for love .
and sometimes i &apos;m my great-grandmama bonavie , who was an actress .
shucks , that &apos;s it .
I keep forgetting you &apos;re just a little girl dressed up in your ma &apos;s long skirts .
no . no , i &apos;m not .
I &apos;m very grown-up , and i &apos;m going to fool the world .
Oh , you don &apos;t say ?
what am i doing getting hooked up with you ?
that &apos;s what i can &apos;t figure out .
what am i doing in a house like this , la-de-daing around ?
funny , the trouble you can get into just by talking to somebody on the street , not meaning anything serious .
high time i cleared out of here .
leave New Orleans ?
where would you go ?
up north .
hadn &apos;t been for you , i &apos;d be out of here before now .
too soft and pretty around here for me .
two or three weeks here , and i was headed for kansas city and chicago .
Oh , why , Clint ?
gambling . I told you that &apos;s how i picked up a little .
then further north to saratoga for the races .
Saratoga ?
is that a nice place ?
July and august , no place like it in the whole world , they tell me- racing every day and gambling .
millionaires , pickpockets , sporting people , politicians , respectable family folks , famous theater actors and actresses- you &apos;ll find them all in saratoga .
say , why don &apos;t you come along ?
later , maybe .
why not now ?
what &apos;s to keep you ?
mama .
Hey , you look downright wicked .
not wicked , Clint . practical .
what are you setting in that steel-trap mind of yours ?
what ?
I &apos;ve sent Cupidon all through town .
he &apos;s listened and learned .
he can find out anything , that one- all the gossip , all the scandal .
there is this daughter .
daughter ?
what daughter ?
Charlotte Thérèse , she is called- the daughter of my father , nicholas Dulaine , and his wife .
she &apos;s 17 and creole . creole ?
new Orleans aristocracy- french and spanish blood .
she &apos;s going to be introduced into society next winter .
all very formal and proper , you see .
it &apos;s not so proper if there pops up more scandal in the family .
hold on .
you &apos;re not fixing to try blackmail , are you ?
Oh , Clint , how can you say such a thing ?
if you are , i &apos;ll chuck you and those two freaks so fast- oh , no , no , no , Clint .
you wouldn &apos;t do that . why wouldn &apos;t i ?
you wouldn &apos;t like people to say ,
&quot; what has happened to the handsome texan that went everywhere with that beautiful creature ? &quot;
Oh , Clint , i &apos;m so happy , Clint .
say that again .
I &apos;m so happy , Clint .
&quot; Cleent . &quot; why don &apos;t you talk american ?
I &apos;m so happy , Clint .
I love to hear your voice .
it goes over me like oil over a blister .
Womenfolks back home are mighty fine- they don &apos;t come any finer- but they kind of got screechy voices .
your voice kind of puts me in mind of a Texas sky at night ... soft and perfect .
what am i mixed up with you for ?
look , what do you want out of me ?
you got me roped , tied , and branded .
me , Clint Maroon . the folks back home would die laughing .
I &apos;ll be wearing ruffles on my pants next .
I adore you when you &apos;re angry .
I &apos;ve seen lots of women , but i &apos;ve never seen a woman like you before .
there isn &apos;t anyone like me , Clint .
go get your duds on . we &apos;re going for a drive .
I ought to drag it out of you .
Bonjour , monsieur !
hook up the team , Cupidon .
we &apos;re going for a drive .
oui , oui , boss .
Pronto ! son of a gun !
I learned to talk like a true cowboy .
you talk like nothing i ever heard .
you ain &apos;t got one kind thought for me , have you , now , mammy ?
you know , it &apos;s funny , whenever i meet up with somebody i don &apos;t like or don &apos;t like me , either i get out or they do ... and i &apos;m staying .
I don &apos;t parlez-vous that stuff , but i kind of catch on you &apos;re not paying me any compliments .
holding you the way i am , mammy , i could crack your backbone just like you &apos;d split a fish .
you &apos;d never be able to walk or talk again , and nobody &apos;d know i done it .
shucks .
I don &apos;t want to hurt you , but we &apos;re going to be friends , you and me .
Oh , yes , we are .
now , listen .
Miss Clio - she &apos;s never had any fun .
maybe you and me and Cupidon all together , we could fix it up so she &apos;d be happy .
I don &apos;t aim to hurt her . I want to help her .
if it means she &apos;ll have that rich husband all comme il faut , respectable ?
Yeah .
I guess that &apos;s what i mean .
you sure ?
anything that she wants .
how &apos;d you like me to make you one big pie for dinner tonight ?
that &apos;s great , mammy .
one thing i ask- you do not call me that .
what ?
That-mammy . it &apos;s one thing i hate out of the slave days .
me , i &apos;m Angelique buiton .
maybe it is vain of me , darling , but i like to show you off .
come away from that window .
mother , she just drove by again .
never mind , cherie .
come practice your piano .
Yes , mama .
every day ... and if her carriage passing by on the street were all .
the other night in a gambling house on royal street .
can you imagine a woman in a gambling house ?
cheap , like her mother before her .
what is she after , mama ?
we can &apos;t step foot out of our house for fear of meeting her face-to-face .
at the market , at begue &apos;s , even at the cathedral .
people staring , talking .
I will not have you go on your knees to her .
tonight i hesitate to occupy our box at the french opera .
our own box !
that looks to me like real bad manners .
it &apos;s the continental custom , cheri .
there is Charlotte .
very plain .
very dowdy . that woman down on rampart street .
remember ?
must be 15 years ago .
she shot him . Hushed up .
this is the daughter .
Paris .
you look very happy this evening .
I am .
honey , you &apos;re wearing out the carpet .
why don &apos;t you gentle down- quit snorting and raring around ?
expecting somebody ?
I always calm down .
too much i &apos;ve been handling this Charlotte , these Dulaines , with kid gloves .
how &apos;s that ?
now i &apos;ll go after them with bare hands .
Cupidon ?
Cupidon ? coming !
I want you to spread the word all around town that i &apos;m turning this place into a gambling house .
let go of me !
you &apos;re hurting me !
look , i &apos;ve lived a rough life .
I &apos;ve come a far piece , and i aim to go farther , but you can &apos;t use me just to muck up an old scandal .
Oh , Clint !
I ought to break every bone in your body .
it was just an idea of mine .
you &apos;re right .
the idea is yours . the whole rotten outfit &apos;s yours .
you &apos;re using me .
Hitch up my team . No-account french rat !
you can &apos;t talk to me like that !
who are you - a big cowboy from Texas , and probably run out as Angelique said !
maybe i was , but it wasn &apos;t for blackmail .
for something worse , then ?
maybe you killed somebody with those big guns you carry around .
Oh !
did you ?
maybe i did- two or three , but it was decent , honest killing .
it wasn &apos;t this dirty , behind-the-back stuff .
it was me or them . they !
aim to make a gentleman out of me , hmm ?
no , no , no , you &apos;re perfect .
sure you do . all women want to make their man over .
you are not my man . you belong to that little woman in Texas .
don &apos;t be poking fun at Texas women .
they could teach you a thing or two .
who could ?
take my ma , for instance- came all the way from virginia with pa in a wagon .
Oh , how very uncomfortable .
shut up !
helped him pioneer the land they lived on , built it up with their own bare hands , and made things grow until ... till they lost it .
lost it ?
how , Clint ? railroad men , they call themselves .
Highbindin &apos; crooks .
they stole pa &apos;s land from him like he was a hick at a country circus .
almost broke his heart .
said it wasn &apos;t like America .
we got ideas about America down there .
did they harm your mama , too ?
poor Clint , you must make them pay .
what in sam hill do you think i &apos;m after doing ?
I promised myself when i grew up , if i ever met up with them- then you should .
and i will .
I &apos;d as soon shoot them down as i would a cottonmouth .
you see , cheri , we are two of a kind .
us ?
Yes .
you heard your mother and father talking of the wrong that was done them .
I heard my mother talking the same way .
your mother ?
Yes . she never hurt a fly , Clint .
excuse me , honey , but if shooting a man and killing him ain &apos;t hurtin &apos; him none ... no , she didn &apos;t kill him .
I know , i know .
she happened to have the gun , and it was pointing at him , the bullet went in him , and he died .
I tell you , no .
if they thought she was killing him , why did they keep sending her money all those years in France ?
that &apos;s called hush money where i come from .
I don &apos;t care what it &apos;s called where you come from !
I &apos;m going to get back at them for what they did to her .
they can &apos;t stop me !
you can &apos;t stop me !
look , Clio . let &apos;s quit this horsing around .
I &apos;m heading north .
go , then .
like i said before , you &apos;re welcome to come along .
no . first i must finish here .
I must have money .
I haven &apos;t any money , either ... i mean , money .
but i know how to turn a trick ... most of the times honest .
honey , i can make out for both of us .
I &apos;ve been doing all right over at the racetrack , the clubhouse .
Faro , roulette , sitting in on poker games .
look here- poker games !
poker games when there are fools with millions !
do you think i came here to pick up dollar bits like those girls in your cheap dance halls in the west , do you ?
right careless way to handle money .
of course , for somebody that &apos;s going to have it to burn- yes , and when i have , it &apos;s going to be my own .
Mine-Clio Dulaine &apos;s . well , good luck .
when you think about us- Texas , Paris- it &apos;s downright comical .
trying to sneak away with me , huh ?
we leave these women , yeah ?
I heard her tell you what to do , now you go and do it .
you go back there and take good care of her , or i &apos;ll skin you alive .
come in , monsieur .
monsieur .
mademoiselle .
from your letter asking me to call at your office- which you chose to ignore , mademoiselle .
Madame , or comtesse , if you prefer .
I &apos;d hoped we were going to be honest and straightforward .
Oh , but of course .
good .
I think i should tell you , i do not belong to the old-school New Orleans tradition .
I belong to the post-war period .
the New Orleans of the river steamboat has ended .
you didn &apos;t come here to discuss steamboats , monsieur .
I believe we understand each other .
now , i have here some- no , no , no .
please , no papers .
when my mother died , there were so many .
you remember my mother , monsieur ?
Madame , uh ... you are causing a great deal of pain to my client , madame nicholas Dulaine , and her daughter Charlotte Thérèse .
your client for many years caused my mother much greater pain .
this is blackmail .
you &apos;re right to say that you &apos;re not of old New Orleans .
I &apos;m sure your manners are of a more recent and unfortunate day .
after all , i didn &apos;t ask to see you .
I was living here quietly in my mother &apos;s house ... quietly ?
... disturbing no one .
I &apos;m young . I like to go by the shops and theaters .
still , if as you suggest , your actions can be construed as blackmail- my actions ?
you can &apos;t frighten me as you did my mother .
good day , monsieur .
no , please .
Ahem .
no , thank you .
um ... may we get to the point ?
I have here $ 5,000 .
it is that or nothing .
$ 5,000 for what ?
&quot; I , who call myself Clio Dulaine ,
&quot; sometimes known as the comtesse de Trignonai du Chenfrais ,
&quot; daughter of the woman Rita who called herself Dulaine ,
&quot; hereby agree and promise
&quot; I shall leave New Orleans within the next 30 days
&quot; and never to return .
I shall cease to call myself Dulaine . &quot;
&quot; after leaving , never to return ,
&quot; I shall do and say nothing
&quot; that will associate me with the family of Dulaine .
I hereby promise- &quot;
and if i do not sign this very inhospitable paper ?
I have political influence .
I can make it very uncomfortable for you .
not as uncomfortable as i can make it for your client .
shall we say 10,000 ?
impossible .
Madame Dulaine is very far from wealthy .
I might possibly stretch her to- shall we save each other some breath and say ... seven ?
10,000 .
now , then , i , too , have certain demands .
you have demands ?
don &apos;t be alarmed .
they &apos;re mostly sentimental . the money is to be paid as if for the sale of this house .
agreed .
in fact , very clever .
then it &apos;s to be torn down and all its furnishings destroyed .
destroy this house , all this magnificent furniture ?
I won &apos;t have dirty eyes gloating over the belongings of my mother .
agreed .
then my mother is to be returned to New Orleans .
it was her dearest wish .
new Orleans was her home .
she &apos;s to be buried in the cemetery of saint louis .
there is a plot of unconsecrated ground there .
it &apos;ll have to do . on her tomb is to be placed her name
- Rita Dulaine , beloved wife .
but , my dear child-
Rita Dulaine .
and flowers are to be placed there once a year on all saints &apos; day , and her tomb is to be kept whitewashed .
when you have rewritten your paper , will you come back this afternoon ?
do you think you can bring Charlotte Thérèse to see me ?
impossible .
this is indecent .
I suppose , but i think my father would have liked it .
Au revoir , monsieur .
Madame , i am interested to know what you are going to do- as a man , an acquaintance , not a lawyer , i mean .
$ 10,000- that can &apos;t last long .
I meant no offense .
I &apos;m amused .
I don &apos;t mind telling you i &apos;m going to marry a very rich and powerful man .
you don &apos;t mean this fellow from - this Texas ?
Oh , no , no , no- not a penny , except what he wins gambling .
I shall go to greener fields .
I hope the money will be of some help .
Madame ?
you are very beautiful .
beautiful .
Yes . isn &apos;t it lucky ?
Letterman !
put those with things we &apos;re gonna take with us , not the things we &apos;re selling .
big show you made to that lawyer was going to destroy everything .
sentimentality is for the public .
Practicality begins at home .
if that isn &apos;t a proverb , it ought to be .
letter !
ahh !
who from ?
what does he say ?
&quot; dear countess , &quot; it begins .
he means that to cut me to the quick .
&quot; every time i think about the ... &quot;
go about your work .
take that chair outside and burn it .
see to the packing , Angelique .
what did he say ?
I haven &apos;t finished it yet .
smash those glasses .
Bartholomew Van Steed .
what you say ?
nothing .
what &apos;s he say ?
he says he &apos;s missing us very much .
me , too ?
all of us !
it &apos;s what she always wanted .
she all fixed up respectable now ?
I hope so , Angelique .
well , that was a good deed what you &apos;ve done for your mama .
Yes . that does for mama .
now we &apos;ll see what we can do for little Clio .
Gangway !
all aboard !
he must be the one , running up and down like a chick without its hen mother .
come . now the bus is gone .
Angelique , hold the jewel box well forward .
look , Angelique , almost everyone is gone .
really , i don &apos;t know what we &apos;re to do .
I was to look for a bus marked Saratoga Springs Hotel , but as you can see , it isn &apos;t here .
why , i beg your pardon .
I couldn &apos;t help overhearing .
I &apos;m driving to the Saratoga Springs Hotel myself .
I couldn &apos;t trouble you .
it &apos;s no trouble at all , i assure you , madame ... or is it miss ?
I &apos;m la comtesse- i am Mrs. Du Chenfrais .
I &apos;m Bart Van Steed . it &apos;s no trouble at all .
Bartholomew Van Steed .
how enchanting !
it &apos;s like being met unexpectedly by a friend in a strange land .
it is a strange land to me , but perhaps you &apos;re meeting someone else .
I was expecting my mother .
she telegraphed that she was arriving on this train .
and she didn &apos;t come ?
perhaps she missed the train or changed her mind .
my mother never misses a train .
and she never changes her mind .
perhaps someone was playing a joke .
people do not play jokes on me .
it was lucky that i brought the phaeton .
mother won &apos;t ride in the dogcart .
but i &apos;m afraid there isn &apos;t room for all of you .
mais certainement , it will do beautifully .
my woman can sit back there with your groom- she &apos;s very thin- and Cupidon can stand here on the step .
now , my bag right there at my feet .
Oh , but i assure you- oh , i don &apos;t mind .
the hotel porter will see to my trunks . Angelique , you have my jewel case ?
good .
Cupidon , right here on the step .
Oh , this is wonderful . so very kind .
I don &apos;t know what i should have done if you hadn &apos;t appeared like a shining knight .
do people always stare like this in America ?
well , when they have someone like you to stare at .
I gather this is your first visit to Saratoga ,
Mrs. Du Chenfrais .
c &apos;est vrai ?
I speak some french .
Oh , no , no !
that is , i read french much better than i speak it .
Hey , you !
your best suite of rooms for madame la comtesse !
did you say ...
Mr. Roscoe bean- our head usher .
your ladyship .
if you please , i wish to live in America quietly and democratically simply as Mrs. Du Chenfrais .
your magnificent hotel is exactly as i knew it would be .
but your ladyship - madame has been here before ?
no . but my husband le comte-the late comte .
comte du Chenfrais .
I don &apos;t seem to recall . was it recently ?
please , i rather we didn &apos;t speak of him anymore .
I &apos;m not yet fully recovered from my bereavement .
if i may be allowed to live here quietly .
of course , of course . Incognito .
how well i remember when his excellency , the marquis de- i assure you Mrs. Du Chenfrais is not interested in his excellency , but in her accommodations .
of course , of course , accommodations .
Accommodations- dear me .
but we have no accommodations .
if madame had only let us know in advance .
perhaps one of the other hotels ?
Mrs. Du Chenfrais , no !
tomorrow i can let you have a suite in one of the cottages in the rear .
I ?
at the rear ?
that &apos;s preposterous !
you must accommodate Mrs. Du Chenfrais .
why , i , myself , will give up my- excuse me , ma &apos;am ... but i couldn &apos;t help overhearing what you were saying .
my name &apos;s Maroon . Clint Maroon .
really , gentlemen , i ... no offense , ma &apos;am .
look here , you can &apos;t address a lady you &apos;ve never met .
introduce us , then , and make it legal .
I &apos;m aiming to help the little lady .
Mrs. Du Chenfrais , may i present colonel Maroon ?
right glad to meet you , ma &apos;am .
I &apos;m occupying three rooms just to stretch my legs , and you might as well have a couple of them .
no , i wouldn &apos;t think of turning you out of your rooms .
there &apos;s no sense of me using all that space .
I &apos;ll go and get my things out , and you can move in right now .
how good of you , colonel , uh ...
Maroon . Clint Maroon .
what a delightful name !
so american .
Texas , ma &apos;am .
Texas ?
I should love to see Texas .
play your cards right , ma &apos;am , and maybe you can .
well , i &apos;ll mosey along and be out in two shakes .
Oh , how can i thank you ?
I feel that we are actually friends .
I &apos;m happy to have been of service .
I hope that your dear mother &apos;s telegram will soon be followed by her company .
Good-bye , Mr. Van Steed .
Oh , i &apos;ll see you again soon , since we &apos;re living under the same roof .
who is this gentleman , your friend in the white hat ?
he &apos;s the real figure of an american . who is he ?
Maroon ?
Texas cattleman , i &apos;m told .
some such thing . but he &apos;s no friend of mine .
Oh , a pity . in Paris , he would have been the rage .
your mother didn &apos;t come , Bartholomew . what a disappointment .
Mrs. Bellop .
you &apos;re not playing a little joke on us , are you , Bart ?
you didn &apos;t drive down to the depot just to meet a certain somebody else ?
I &apos;m not obliged to explain my behavior to a lot of harpies on a hotel piazza .
she &apos;s really lovely .
I tell you , i don &apos;t even know the lady .
you must introduce me sometime . I should love to meet her .
raise those shades . mind that luggage .
I &apos;ll have a housekeeper and chamber maids up here immediately .
nothing now , thank you .
no maids . I must rest .
cupid , run down to see if the trunks have come .
well , it looks like this is about all of my stuff , ma &apos;am .
it &apos;s so kind of you , Mr. - Colonel Maroon .
I feel quite guilty .
no call to at all . good day , ma &apos;am .
well , it looks like we &apos;re going to be neighbors .
I &apos;ll lock the door on your side , Mrs. Du Chenfrais .
now , if you &apos;ll kindly lock it on your side , colonel Maroon .
it &apos;s a double lock , you see . both sides .
if there &apos;s anything i can do for you- if there &apos;s anything at all , Mr. Bean , i &apos;ll send for you at once .
thank you so much . now , you will let me know if-
how are you , ma &apos;am ?
if you &apos;d called me &quot; ma &apos;am &quot; down there once more , i &apos;d have screamed .
I sure would have admired to hear you , ma &apos;am , only i &apos;d have hated to have you scare Bart away .
how in sam hill you get him eating out of your hand ?
I &apos;d discovered that Mrs. Van Steed was safely in bar harbor having a grandchild , so i sent him a telegram to meet me at the station .
and he came ?
I signed it &quot; mama . &quot;
huh .
when i saw him sashaying in acting like he owned you- are you jealous- you &apos;re durn tooting , i &apos;m jealous .
just have to get used to it , my darling .
we mustn &apos;t forget why i &apos;m here .
send her away .
it was a long train trip .
my poor child .
I didn &apos;t sleep not one hour on that dreadful train .
thinking up that flashy entrance ?
ha ha !
clever , wasn &apos;t it ?
what did you come here for , anyway ?
I was getting along fine .
did they get wise to you and kick you out of New Orleans ?
you know very well why i came here . have i ever pretended ?
no , but ain &apos;t you ever gonna be satisfied ?
satisfied with what ?
some good jewelry ?
mama &apos;s made-over clothes ?
money enough to last me over the summer if i &apos;m careful ?
I want respectability and comfort and security !
we cannot get used to each other , cheri .
not too much . that would be bad , n &apos;est-ce pas ?
Oh , very bad . Ness pop .
it &apos;s no use arguing with her , Mr. Clint .
she &apos;s very tired . she ought to go to sleep .
Oh , there are hundreds of things i must know before i sleep .
stop scowling like a cross little boy and talk to me !
peaches !
peaches !
Hey , you !
peaches !
Hey , Clio !
hold it ! you can &apos;t do that !
you can &apos;t do that !
come here !
I want a peach !
I &apos;m hungry !
stop screaming into the streets !
here &apos;s Cupidon !
he can go !
quick , Cupidon , before the man is gone !
Hey , you little soldier !
bring me some champagne .
fresh peaches bobbing in a glass of champagne !
that &apos;s the way mama used to drink it in Paris !
peaches !
peaches !
Mrs. Bellop , i looked it up in burke &apos;s peerage .
there &apos;s no Du Chenfrais .
of course there isn &apos;t .
burke &apos;s peerage is english , and she &apos;s french .
Oh , good morning , little man .
how long have you been with the countess , and where did you come from ?
Oh , so i &apos;m a fat old sow , am i ?
Merci bien !
that &apos;s the way i love it . Mmm .
cozy and everyone near me ... and things stirring .
take a little sip , cheri .
just a little sip . it &apos;s heavenly .
peaches in champagne ?
that &apos;s no drink for a man .
don &apos;t be like that .
tell me everything .
tell me about these men ... these rich , respectable old men who sit and rock on that huge piazza .
if it &apos;s Bart Van Steed you have on your mind , he &apos;s gonna be too busy to bother about you , honey .
I heard yesterday they &apos;re out to get him .
why ?
how ?
when ?
Van Steed owns a railroad between Albany and Binghamton , right up here near Saratoga .
it &apos;s what they call a trunk line , only about 100 miles long .
years ago , his mama gave it to him to play with- his first little railroad .
now it &apos;s turned up worth millions .
why millions ?
Angelique , stop rattling that paper !
why is this Saratoga trunk worth millions ?
how can i sleep when there are things like this i must know ?
tell me-why millions ?
well , it seems it &apos;s the link between the new pennsylvania hard coal lands and new england .
sure thing , it &apos;s worth millions .
does he know this ? Van Steed ?
listen , he ain &apos;t as loco as he looks .
don &apos;t raise your eyebrows when i say &quot; ain &apos;t . &quot;
Raymond Soule &apos;s crowd have been going at it with every dirty trick there is in the book .
graft . politics . force .
for what they &apos;re doing , they &apos;d be strung up for outlaws out west .
you wouldn &apos;t believe it . they hire gangs to go out and tear up tracks and chop down trestles .
folks won &apos;t ride the railroad anymore . it ain &apos;t safe .
that &apos;s just what this Soule &apos;s figuring on- running it right down to nothing .
buy it up cheap - hair , hide , horns , and tallow .
who is he ?
he &apos;s boss of the upstate railroad crowd .
likely , you were too busy making goo-goo eyes when you come in to notice him .
always sitting there on the piazza hiding behind a couple of bodyguards .
don &apos;t let his size fool you . he &apos;s big poison .
is he rich ?
rub my foot , cheri .
huh .
couple of hundred million .
maybe more .
is he married ?
no , honey . no .
I mean , no for you .
well , one never knows .
now , go on , cheri . I &apos;m fascinated .
Mmm , that feels good .
there &apos;s more to this Soule bunch .
they &apos;re hooked up with those skunks that came through Texas .
Oww !
you &apos;re hurting me !
sorry , honey . I was thinking .
my fingers just itch to get ahold of a gun when i think of that pack of varmints out there rocking .
I bet i could pick one or two of them off from your window .
poor little Bartholomew Van Steed .
poor little mama &apos;s boy . no one to help him .
don &apos;t worry about little Bartholomew .
he &apos;s got a good team , too- for one , the richest banker in new york , the fellow that &apos;s got that place down on wall street- the house of something or other- and that scotchman who owns all those steel mills and coal mines ,
and plenty of others .
railroads !
railroads !
railroads !
what do i care about railroads ?
what am i doing here ?
who are you ?
how do i know who you are ?
holy cats ! now what &apos;s eating the countess ?
there , baby , Angelique is here !
Mr. Clint , that champagne make her sad .
why don &apos;t you gentle down , honey , and quit snorting &apos; around ?
go away !
go away !
everybody , go away !
stop screeching around here like a crazy mare .
first thing you &apos;re happy , then you &apos;re tired .
now you &apos;re sad or something .
try that again , and you &apos;ll be here all alone .
Ooh , what &apos;s that ?
from the man who brought us from the station .
Clint ... is he the one i shall marry ?
I don &apos;t give a hoot who you marry , but you &apos;re not gonna get me to act as your- you &apos;ll act towards me with the dignity and respect of someone who &apos;s met Mrs. Du Chenfrais for the first time .
a widow so recently bereft- of her senses .
but not her dramatic sense .
they &apos;ll be expecting me .
they &apos;ll be waiting for me .
so for days and days , i &apos;ll stay up here , and i &apos;ll let them wait and wonder .
I &apos;ll stay here and watch the show .
why , these people will make cold hash out of you in a week .
they &apos;ll tear you to pieces , and i &apos;ll stand by and laugh .
Hey , look , she &apos;s clean beat out .
and no wonder drinking champagne in the middle of the day .
what are we gonna do with her , Angelique ?
when she &apos;s like this , ain &apos;t anybody can do anything .
she like this in Paris before she come .
she like this in New Orleans before she met you .
she sleep perhaps one day , perhaps two or three .
but when she wake up , zumba !
look out !
look out ?
what can she do she hasn &apos;t done already ?
crazy stuff !
where boss man go now ?
to the horses ?
all right , we &apos;ll go to the track if you want .
anyplace we can smell some fresh air .
sure ! sure , boss . we go to the horses .
women is crazy ! n &apos;est-ce pas ?
you betcha . son of a gun !
maybe they dead .
mama ...
Clint ... oh , cheri .
what time is it ?
7 : 00. what day is it ?
Oh ... why , baby , you slept two days , last i know .
Oh , i feel wonderful !
quick , Angelique , my gabrielle !
look out , that &apos;s what i told him .
my mind is clear and bright , just as i knew it would be .
and i have a plan , as i knew i would have .
what now ?
more mess ?
you &apos;ll see . roll up the shades !
tell me , where is Mr. Maroon ?
ain &apos;t seen nor heard of him .
good . where &apos;s Cupidon ?
in here ?
poor little man .
Howdy , ma &apos;am .
good morning , Cupidon .
why didn &apos;t you sleep downstairs in the room provided for you ?
he said stay near you and the old crow .
Ah , to watch me , no doubt .
tell me , what have you found out ?
who are the important people ?
well , there &apos;s that fat woman .
ha ha ha !
who is the fat woman ?
Bellop .
don &apos;t make ugly noises .
that &apos;s her name- bellop .
they say everybody in Saratoga &apos;s afraid of her .
Yes ?
she tried to question me about you .
I pretended to speak only french .
and what do you think ?
she speaks french like anything !
so ... well , out of here , both of you .
make yourself neat and smart .
you , Cupidon , look to your shoes and buttons .
be polite to the hotel servants . no tricks !
and you , Angelique , no voodoo , no witchwork .
your best black silk !
we &apos;re going to the springs .
about time . two days lost .
red heels ain &apos;t for widows .
it &apos;s the way i feel today .
my husband has been dead as a herring for at least two years .
you full of the devil .
your ladyship , Mrs. Du Chenfrais .
how have you been , Mr. Bean ?
frantic . simply frantic .
two days !
there have been dozens of inquiries .
how kind of people to take such interest .
we pictured you desolated with your grief .
I think i &apos;ll take the waters this morning .
I hear your famous springs are most healthful .
perhaps you could recommend one .
of course . we have a specially prepared booklet .
I told you these two days haven &apos;t been wasted .
regardez . by the front door .
that &apos;s the one been asking questions about you .
for example , there &apos;s the triton water- gout , irritated stomachs , pimples blotches , ulcers .
please , Mr. Bean !
the empire spring is very gay .
the band plays- good morning .
Mrs. Du Chenfrais , i &apos;m Mrs. Coventry bellop .
I want to welcome you to Saratoga ... and to tell you that i had the great pleasure of knowing your late lamented husband- dear , dear bimby .
is it possible ?
well , isn &apos;t it ?
hardly . he was almost a recluse .
perhaps you &apos;re thinking of his younger brother- the black sheep , i &apos;m afraid .
he was known as bimby among his friends .
I shouldn &apos;t wonder , if you say so .
I told you you were wrong to be suspicious of this lady .
me ? my dear Mrs. Bellop !
Oh , isn &apos;t that- but of course it must be-
Mr. Raymond Soule , the railroad man .
Yes , indeed .
I &apos;ll speak to him .
nobody ever speaks to Mr. Soule unless Mr. Soule speaks to them first .
good morning , Mr. Soule , so pleasant to see you !
my husband spoke of you .
I am Mrs. Du Chenfrais .
I do not know the name .
you &apos;ll recall him as le comte Du Chenfrais .
please don &apos;t stand up .
perhaps it was this colonel ... white hat Maroon i heard speak of you .
I don &apos;t know him , either .
the texan-the one who &apos;s says he &apos;s going to ruin you ?
good day , Mr. Soule . such a lovely chat .
now i &apos;m walking to this delightful empire spring .
walking !
but everybody rides to take the waters .
but i am here for my health .
what a woman !
she makes her entrance here on the arm of our most eligible bachelor .
she disappears for two days while we wonder .
when she reappears , her first act is to be seen talking to the almighty Mr. Soule .
but she walks to the springs .
what will people say ?
it &apos;s heresy .
don &apos;t be any sillier than you are , dear beanie .
it &apos;s sheer genius ... if she can get away with it .
another cup , Angelique .
I can feel it doing me good .
good morning , Mrs. Du Chenfrais .
good morning .
good morning .
you didn &apos;t come down ... not ill .
weary .
I can understand that .
but you look- you seem to be fully recovered , that is , if appearances are anything .
thank you .
you must have driven down very early .
I didn &apos;t drive . I walked .
walked ?
then you must allow me to drive you back .
no , no . I &apos;m walking back .
I intend to walk down and back every morning early- that &apos;s one of the european cures .
splendid idea . you must allow me to walk with you .
if you care to . good day .
may i stroll with you ?
of course .
there &apos;s that fascinating Mr. Maroon .
you presented him , remember ?
and he will ask to drive me back , too .
you &apos;re all so kind .
he &apos;s the reason i &apos;ve been so weary until now .
all that first night , he kept me awake .
if he &apos;s been annoying you- no , not him , exactly .
it was talk , talk , talk in the next room .
railroads , railroads- i thought i should go mad .
I &apos;m thinking of moving to a cottage apartment this morning , for quiet .
they weren &apos;t talking railroads , were they ?
what could they say about railroads that would keep a charming woman awake ?
I don &apos;t know . such things are too much for me .
Oh , Albany and trunk lines .
tell me , what is the Saratoga trunk ?
I thought it was something for clothes .
trunks and railroads kept whirling around in my head . maddening , it was .
have i said something ?
you look troubled .
good morning , Mrs. Du Chenfrais .
Colonel Maroon .
if you &apos;re going back to the hotel- what is this i hear about you talking railroads so loud that this lady has to move out of her rooms ?
you &apos;ve been circulating this morning .
on my way out of the hotel just now , i met Mr. Soule .
he wanted to know what this was about my threatening to-
Soule ?
are you hooked up with him ?
I hope i haven &apos;t said anything i shouldn &apos;t .
just to know you &apos;ve had my name on your lips gives me pleasure .
you shouldn &apos;t be angry with colonel Maroon .
he &apos;s on your side .
I distinctly heard his voice say that he thought you were more clever than any of them .
by that time , they were shouting .
when i was talking to Mr. Soule this morning on the piazza , i thought his voice sounded like the one who was disputing Mr. Maroon .
Mr. Maroon was telling him he had some kind of a plan that was going to win this railroad war .
he was going to offer it to you and ruin Mr. Soule ... or was it the other way around ?
Oh , oh , dear me ... i hope you aren &apos;t angry with me .
Oh , dear Mr. Van Steed , oh , dear colonel Maroon , i detest strong-minded women who interfere in men &apos;s affairs .
I understand , ma &apos;am .
Colonel , possibly you could run my railroad better than I- now , gentlemen , this is no place to discuss business .
have you forgotten you &apos;ve asked me to have breakfast with you ?
well , that &apos;s hardly possible .
I &apos;m having breakfast over at the track with the grooms and the jockeys .
Oh , what a delightful surprise !
ladies can &apos;t eat in stables .
well , this one can .
you &apos;re not going without me , miss Clio !
let him come .
I do want to thank you for the lovely pink roses you sent .
I am glad you liked them ... and don &apos;t forget , Mrs. Du Chenfrais- you &apos;re dining with me tonight .
delighted .
cheri , you &apos;re not angry .
take your hand off my arm !
what do you think i &apos;m driving ?
cattle ?
how can you talk to me like that ?
no one has ever talked to me- it &apos;s time they did , then .
Clint , i have such a clever idea . I &apos;m only trying to help you .
I &apos;ll try to explain this slow and easy without losing my temper .
really , you should be proud of me . I &apos;m only thinking of your future .
interrupt again , and i &apos;ll smash in your pretty nose .
I &apos;ve got some plans of my own .
Oh , Clint , have you ?
what are they ?
and i don &apos;t need you to come busting in .
let &apos;s see ... i &apos;m only a woman .
I don &apos;t have a right to think .
I &apos;ve got every respect for womankind , but in Texas , it &apos;s the men who wear the pants .
I was up here wearing mine .
now you come along , starting trouble , acting downright loco .
what have i done ?
I only just arrived .
and then what ?
screeching out of hotel windows , peaches and champagne in the middle of the day , pulling the sleeping beauty act , sashaying out telling the doggonedest mess of lies .
you planning to keep this up ?
Yes . I &apos;ve thought of the most wonderful things .
it &apos;s going to be better and better all the time .
I don &apos;t give a hang what you do as long as you keep your nose out of my affairs .
I can be nagged by women , i can be fooled by women , i can be coaxed by women , but no woman &apos;s going to run me .
you just pin back those pretty ears of yours and take heed of what i &apos;m saying .
cheri , i think that even when i marry someone else , i &apos;ll always love you best .
heaven help the man that takes up with you for life .
I wouldn &apos;t be in his shoes , not for a million .
I &apos;m hoping he &apos;ll have much more than a million .
if you mean little Bartholomew , his mama brushes girls like you aside like flies .
his mama isn &apos;t here , cheri .
when she hears what you &apos;re doing to her baby boy , she will be , soon enough .
and he &apos;ll pay heed to her , too .
he was brought up prim and proper .
he was brought up by a woman who was stronger and more possessive than he-his mother .
I &apos;ll be stronger and more possessive than she .
and cleverer . you &apos;ll see , cheri .
women are the most unmoral people there are .
cheri , darling , darling .
attention !
Aah !
jumping catfish !
you see what you do to me ?
I don &apos;t know whether i &apos;m going or coming .
you intend to stay over in this country long , Mrs. Du Chenfrais ?
that depends , Mr. Van Steed , upon so many , many things .
on what , for instance ?
things you &apos;d consider quite sordid , i &apos;m afraid .
sordid ?
everything is so expensive over here .
it takes so many francs to make one american dollar .
you should never have to worry about such things .
you &apos;re so- you should have everything that &apos;s beauti- well , beautiful .
you &apos;re so kind .
you smoke cigarettes , Mrs. Du Chenfrais ?
well , i &apos;ve never seen a lady smoke a cigarette before .
it &apos;s a continental custom , i suppose .
I &apos;ve smoked since i was a baby .
Yes , but ...
people will ... well , in a hotel , people talk .
how kind of you to protect me like that .
I &apos;m not used to american ways , but a cigarette ... a cigarette is sometimes cozy when one is lonely .
don &apos;t you find it so , Mr. Van Steed ?
I &apos;m a cigar smoker myself .
Oh , but of course .
so masculine .
I shouldn &apos;t think you &apos;d be lonely , Mrs. Du Chenfrais .
you &apos;re so popular and ... well , a woman of the world .
Oh , Mrs. Du Chenfrais !
have i said something ?
a woman of the world .
imagine for yourself if your dear sister , for example , would suddenly find herself a widow and alone in Paris , alone with only a servant or two and knowing no one .
she follows the way to which she is accustomed in her old loved America .
is that a woman of the world ?
Oh , Mrs. Du Chenfrais- Clio , i ... you called me Clio .
how dear , how good ... how friendly .
what ?
you &apos;re such a help to me .
help ?
I ? you can &apos;t guess how much i would like to do for you .
all i can say is that your friendship is the most beautiful thing that ever happened to me .
shall we go in ?
the music &apos;s started .
Colonel Maroon .
countess .
we might as well get rid of this .
Van Steed won &apos;t be here now .
I saw him on the arm of the countess .
you could have your poker game if i could have the other arm .
Van seems to be going all the way for this french girl .
or is the french girl going for him ?
before he &apos;s through , he might find that more expensive than poker .
500 .
I &apos;ll tilt you 1,000 .
are they that good , colonel ?
you can throw in a handful of stock in that Saratoga trunk line of yours if you &apos;re short of chips .
looks like it won &apos;t be worth much nohow when Soule and his crowd gets through with it .
why do you want it ?
why are you interested ?
if i had it , i wouldn &apos;t let anybody take it away from me .
Leastways , not without a scrap .
and how do you propose to do that ?
you don &apos;t understand all this fight involves .
it &apos;s tied up in politics .
Soule &apos;s crowd has sewed up the law courts .
law ?
where i come from , possession is nine points of that .
they &apos;ve got the legislature , and they &apos;ve manipulated the stock .
even down in Texas , we know that watering stock don &apos;t only mean just giving the cows a drink .
but you &apos;re right .
all that stuff- dirty politics- that ain &apos;t up my alley ... but fighting is .
I &apos;ve never seen one yet that wasn &apos;t won by being quicker on the draw .
I &apos;d fight them barehanded- same old plan we used out west when the sheepmen tried to run the cattlemen off the range .
Soule &apos;s crowd is wrecking your railroad .
you &apos;ve got to keep it running or lose your franchise .
I &apos;d battle them bloody . I &apos;d run them off the range .
lordy , lordy , i think maybe you would .
where have you been hiding this man ?
I &apos;d get me a bunch of boys together , the real hard-muscled kind .
there &apos;s a lot of them down where i come from that don &apos;t like railroads any more than they do rattlers .
worse . it &apos;s the wild east .
we hang men down there for less crimes than you boys do to each other just in fun .
what can we lose that we aren &apos;t losing now ?
maybe we &apos;d better let this minority stockholder in just to take care of us .
all right , it will cost you all a fistful of stock .
a big fistful .
it &apos;s worth it , colonel , if you can do this .
I &apos;ll do it .
I &apos;ll go the whole hog to put my brand on that crowd that came through Texas .
I &apos;ve got a little score of my own to settle .
win this , and you won &apos;t have to stop with any fistful of stock .
I &apos;ll take you along with me , right up the line .
likely , i &apos;ll have the whole railroad before i &apos;m through .
Colonel , i think you &apos;re my boy .
just hang a welcome sign on the front door of that house of yours on wall street .
you &apos;ve just acquired yourself a partner .
morning , colonel .
Hey , what &apos;s up ?
the cats seem to be meowing louder than ordinary this morning .
Colonel Maroon , you kill me the way you put things .
it &apos;s madame Van Steed .
Madame Van Steed has arrived .
you don &apos;t say .
battle &apos; em bloody !
run them up the range !
son of a gun !
ha ha ha !
I listen to all the poker games .
I &apos;m just keyhole-sized .
quit talking !
Wranglers and poker games-who cares about all that ?
where &apos;s Mr. Clint all the time ?
where have you been ?
you ain &apos;t touched your lunch , honey .
Mr. Clint .
saw the bellboy stagger and thought i &apos;d help him with his load .
Bartholomew &apos;s splurging .
flowers . that &apos;s a northerner for you .
why ain &apos;t he sent you jewelry ?
to take jewelry from a man that &apos;s not your husband , that isn &apos;t nice .
my ma never had any husband any more than you , but she got jewelry- diamonds and ruby rings and large stone necklaces .
I &apos;ll give you my diamond stickpin if you want it , honey .
how are you making out with little Bart ?
wonderfully .
that &apos;s fine , countess .
I reckon i just wasn &apos;t worth fretting &apos; about that day at the french market .
where have you been , Clint ?
why don &apos;t i see you ?
Business- playing railroad , gettinne , too .
you know , i &apos;d like to take you around , honey , but i had a little matter to attend to .
now , Bart , he &apos;d come a - running if he knew you wanted to go out .
why don &apos;t you send Cupidon over with a note ?
how dare you !
what &apos;s up ?
have i said something- how dare you say to me that you &apos;re busy and suggest that i go around asking other men to take me here and there ?
hold on . I didn &apos;t say anything about other men .
I said Bart. He &apos;s the man you &apos;re fixing to marry .
Oh . so that &apos;s it . you &apos;re jealous .
Yeah .
Leastways , i would be if i had time , but i &apos;m busy as a sheepdog .
it &apos;s too bad your plan isn &apos;t working out so well .
whose plan isn &apos;t ?
in a game like yours , you got to work quick and get out before they find the pea under the walnut shell .
Yeah . it &apos;s too bad you &apos;re too late .
too late ?
I sure hate to tell you .
it seems downright cruel .
Bart &apos;s mama &apos;s come .
mama Van Steed .
Yes , ma &apos;am , countess .
the queen of Saratoga , the head cat .
the lioness has come to defend her cub .
when ?
she descended this morning , they tell me , with her claws showing and her fangs bared .
the other tabbies are paying court to her on the piazza right now .
I wonder how your pretty skin &apos;s gonna look in ribbons ?
Angelique , get my things .
Cupidon , get the carriage and take miss Clio for a drive .
I think she &apos;ll need some fresh air .
you betcha .
Mrs. Du Chenfrais is coming now , mother .
De Trignonai du Chenfrais de fiddlesticks .
she &apos;s an adventuress . it &apos;s written all over her .
good morning , countess .
Colonel Maroon .
fetch her .
Oh , Mrs. Du Chenfrais .
my mother says she would very much like to meet you .
she has heard so much about you .
I would be enchanted to meet your dear mother .
good morning , countess . comment ca va ?
bon jour , madame .
good morning , Clarissa .
good morning .
may i present Mrs. Du Chenfrais .
how do you do ?
I hear you call yourself a countess .
no . I call myself Mrs. Du Chenfrais .
very clever .
won &apos;t you sit down ?
you say you &apos;ve been here before , they tell me .
no . my dear husband was here once .
dear edouard- the late comte .
that ninny roscoe bean couldn &apos;t find your husband &apos;s signature in the hotel register .
isn &apos;t that odd ? his signature ?
I &apos;ve been coming to the Saratoga hotel for years .
I &apos;ve met every well-known person that ever stopped here- in my day , that is .
and i &apos;ve searched the registers , old and new ... but no comte du Chenfrais .
are you sure he stayed here ?
eh ?
Incognito .
when a french diplomat is in America on affairs of state , it &apos;s sometimes wise to discard titles .
well , i &apos;m quite sure mother doesn &apos;t mean- i &apos;m quite sure that mother does mean .
she doesn &apos;t mean a thing , do you , Clarissa ?
I always did tell dear etienne that his passion for shunning the limelight was silly .
etienne ?
and who is etienne ?
her husband . I knew him well .
didn &apos;t you say edouard ?
his intimates called him etienne .
a pet name .
Clarissa , i always say it doesn &apos;t pay to inquire too closely into the background of us summer Saratoga folk .
take you , Clarissa .
you call yourself a lady , but that doesn &apos;t necessarily mean that you are one , does it ?
I advise you to stay out of this , sophie .
I was merely going to remark in all innocence that my family can remember when your family climbed out of the gutter .
come , Mrs. Du Chenfrais .
shall we have a bit of a chat ?
that would be charming .
enchanted to have met you , madame Van Steed .
you &apos;re all that your dear son has led me to expect .
I hope you weren &apos;t too sharp with that very provincial old lady .
provincial old lady ?
she &apos;s an old hellcat .
thank you very much for being helpful . Good-bye .
nonsense , my girl . I want to talk to you . it &apos;s important .
in the garden ?
no . in your room . we can talk better there .
if you &apos;d asked me who i &apos;d rather be than anyone else in the world at this minute , i &apos;d say you .
me ?
but why ?
no reason . no reason , my girl .
except that you &apos;re young and beautiful and smart , and you &apos;ve got two dashing young men in love with you .
at least , poor Bart would dash if that old harridan would let go of his coattails long enough to let him dash .
and you &apos;d be very rich if you use some sense .
Angelique , bring the coffee in here .
Yes , ma &apos;am .
just what is it you want of me ?
money .
I have no money .
but you will have .
how ? listening to me .
you have no money . why haven &apos;t you listened to yourself ?
because i &apos;m not you . I explained that to you a minute ago .
tell your woman to shut the door .
she knows everything .
she never talks .
no , thank you .
if you mean to harm me , she &apos;d be likely to kill you .
she &apos;d make a little figure like you out of soap , and she &apos;d stick pins into it , and you &apos;d sicken and die .
not i .
I &apos;ve had pins stuck in me all my life- knives and everything up to pickaxes .
all my life , Mrs. Bellop , i &apos;ve been very direct .
if i wanted to do a thing and it was possible , i did it .
I say what i want to say . that old lady on the piazza dislikes me .
she makes no pretense . I admire her for it .
I shall be grateful if you &apos;ll be as honest .
you &apos;re right . she hates you .
she wants to run you out of Saratoga , and she &apos;ll do it unless ... unless ?
look , my girl , i know that you &apos;re no more the countess de trumprechoochoo than i &apos;m queen victoria .
but if i say you are , if i stand up for you against that old buzzard and her crew , the world will believe you are .
I &apos;ve watched you , and i &apos;ll say this , you &apos;ve been wonderful- bold and dramatic and believable .
but from now on , you &apos;re gonna need a strong arm behind you , and that handsome texan &apos;s arm isn &apos;t gonna be enough .
it &apos;s got to be a woman that &apos;s smarter than old lady Van Steed and somebody that she &apos;s scared of .
that &apos;s me . you saw it .
I look like a wash woman , but i &apos;ve got family and influence , and all she &apos;s got are two generations of money .
what do you want ?
I know my way around this world .
I know what it is to be very rich , and i know what it is to be very poor .
I &apos;ve lived on nothing for years ... in luxury .
blackmail ?
Oh , give me credit for being smarter than that .
I make certain hotels fashionable by touting for them .
I put Saratoga on the map .
I made newport , though i must say i can &apos;t bear the place .
I &apos;ve been everywhere . I know europe , and i know America .
and if i give a party that somebody else pays for , everybody comes because i &apos;m giving it .
don &apos;t ask me why . I don &apos;t know .
I &apos;ve got nothing to lose because i live by my wits .
they can &apos;t take those away from me .
and i say and i do as i please because i &apos;m not afraid of anybody .
it &apos;s a grand feeling .
in a way , you &apos;re just like i am .
I &apos;ve always- i know all about you .
I have connections in New Orleans .
how much do you want ?
your name was Clio Dulaine , and now you want it to be Mrs. Bartholomew Van Steed .
I think you can get him with my help , though why you want him with that texan around- me , i &apos;d marry him though he hadn &apos;t a penny .
those shoulders and small through the hips , and the way he looks at you- oh , me !
always was a fool .
I &apos;ll take 25,000 down on the day of the wedding and 10,000 a year for life .
I don &apos;t want to be grasping . how do you know that i can &apos;t do this alone ?
try it .
come in .
edouard .
etienne .
are you two plotting something ?
you look guilty as all get out .
if i were only 25 years younger , my boy-
Mrs. Bellop has offered to be my chaperone .
a little late , i &apos;d say .
not too late , we hope .
not too late for what ?
for social success and marriage to someone who &apos;s really mad about her , with your blessing .
she &apos;s got that now .
I &apos;ll see you later . I got to pack my bag .
pardon me .
Clint !
I almost forgot to tell you , honey .
I &apos;m taking a little trip .
where ?
where are you going ?
Albany .
what for ?
you used to tell me everything .
what are you keeping from me ?
on business . a couple of days .
business ?
now , what business ?
Cupidon will take care of you .
and Bart .
want me to go with you ?
now , look here , honey , you can &apos;t go traveling around with colonel Maroon , a respectable widow like you .
you set out to catch yourself a millionaire .
you got him roped and tied .
now all you got to do is cinch the saddle down on him .
poor little Bart .
in his place , i sure would feel cheap to think i was being married just for my money .
you never need to fear .
if you win $ 500 at cards , you feel yourself rich .
that sweet little woman in Texas has just such ambitions , i &apos;m sure- the one who makes those ravishing white ties , those blue forget-me-nots .
sure is comical how a woman likes to put her mark on a man with a needle .
you couldn &apos;t rest nor wait till you had me crawling with all those fancy initials on my shirts and handkerchiefs .
I look to wake up some day and find a big &quot; c &quot; branded on my rump .
Bart hasn &apos;t asked me to marry him .
he isn &apos;t the asking kind .
you got to tell him .
sure was different in New Orleans .
why can &apos;t it be like that here ?
you were mighty sweet those days .
ornery , but mighty sweet .
Clint , cheri . you &apos;re not leaving me .
take me with you .
all the way ?
me the boss ?
when will you be back ?
why ?
I want you to take me to the ball saturday .
I thought you were fixing to go with Bart .
I was , but ... better go with him .
Adios , honey . and good luck .
I know .
I heard , and i won &apos;t pretend that it was accidental .
why doesn &apos;t he understand ?
what man ever did ?
it isn &apos;t the money !
I want security , protection , respectability- things that have been very scarce on my side of the family , even my own mama .
I know about your mother and her mother and all the other generations of getting the dirty end of the bargain .
mama and all she stood in New Orleans and all that i saw in Paris , that was something to make one really sick !
I won &apos;t be treated like her !
I won &apos;t !
I won &apos;t !
no need to , if you follow my advice .
no , Mrs. Bellop .
I think i &apos;ll just go on alone .
I don &apos;t want you to think i &apos;m ungrateful .
you &apos;ve been honest , and you &apos;ve been good .
here . please take this .
you &apos;re the only woman who &apos;s shown me kindness .
see here , Clio .
I &apos;m going to stand behind you anyway- just in case- because i like you , and i don &apos;t like Clarissa Van Steed .
and just to prove what a sentimental fool i can be , here &apos;s your ring .
hang onto your jewelry , i always say .
it &apos;s a woman &apos;s best friend .
Hi , Clint .
Hi , al . you boys ready ?
Yep .
get them aboard , Al .
all right , men . climb on .
now what are you doing here ?
I came to fight .
you gonna fight , i gonna fight , too .
did she send you ?
Nah . I run away .
doggone if i haven &apos;t got a mind to tan you good .
how did you know where i was going ?
I listened at the keyhole . I heard everything .
this is gonna be a fine fight .
I &apos;m gonna punch &apos; em in the stomach .
I &apos;ll learn you to flap those big ears of yours at keyholes .
get on away from here . go home !
please , Mr. Clint , let me stay .
I can fight . I &apos;m strong .
get going , you little half-pint .
I &apos;m a man , Mr. Clint .
now go home and take care of the womenfolk the way i told you .
get her rolling , Al !
&apos;Board !
pull your shades down , men !
like i said , no guns- only the butts in a pinch , and maybe the other end if they start shooting first .
every station between here and Binghamton , we &apos;re in and out before they can telegraph word ahead .
we throw them out and leave a bunch off behind to hold the fort .
when you hear one whistle from the engine ahead , that means ready .
when you hear three , pile out .
three more , pile on in and on your way .
understand ?
Yeah . Yeah .
first stop , boys . hold onto your hats .
get rolling , al !
you men , stay here and hold the fort .
Bainbridge .
only 30 miles to Binghamton , the end of the line .
lordy , lordy , lordy .
bad ?
what is it ?
Soule &apos;s got wind of it .
he &apos;s starting a train from the other end .
better get word to the colonel if we can .
lordy , lordy , when those two trains meet ... we &apos;ve got to get him in this tunnel .
now get going !
&apos;Board !
come on , get on .
don &apos;t worry , chief .
we &apos;ll pile &apos; em up , and they &apos;ll never get to Binghamton .
these texans are pretty tough , but if we can wreck them , there won &apos;t be any fight .
but get ready to jump when you get the signal , and if any of those cowhands get out of the wreck , boff &apos; em up .
any sign of them yet ?
Nope .
next stop , Binghamton , boys .
mighty pretty country .
Hey , wait a minute .
wonder what &apos;s up .
did you whistle for me ?
there &apos;s a train coming .
no train due along here now , is there ?
no , but there sure is one coming .
I can feel it on the rails .
better let them know we &apos;re in the tunnel .
they must have heard us .
they &apos;re trying to whistle us down .
keep that throttle open !
we can only nail them in that tunnel .
they &apos;re still coming .
maybe Soule &apos;s gotten wise and is trying to head us off .
they wouldn &apos;t try and ram us in here , would they ?
they might .
give her all you got and let &apos;s get out of this tunnel .
the boys can &apos;t jump .
I won &apos;t signal them till we get out of here .
we made it !
Yeah , and there they are , coming like a-
come on !
what are you waiting for ?
Aah !
Cupidon , you little son of a gun , get out of here !
Ooh !
Hey , hey , hey , boss !
Hey , it &apos;s Clint !
there &apos;s one . get him .
where is everybody ?
Angelique !
now , where have you been ?
upstairs , looking for- fasten my dress .
why aren &apos;t you here when i need you ?
something frets me .
I wish we &apos;d never come to this place . I hate it .
I wish we &apos;d stayed in Paris .
I wish we &apos;d stayed in New Orleans .
not even he cares anymore .
he leaves me alone .
Oh , baby ... like my beautiful Rita .
I &apos;m not Rita , i &apos;m Clio .
I shall make my life the way i said .
no weeping , no whimpering .
I &apos;m strong again . I &apos;ll let him go .
vache !
that gascon with his swagger .
Oh , he &apos;s not a gascon .
he doesn &apos;t swagger .
you know what i think ?
I think we seen the last of him-that one .
how dare you say that he won &apos;t be back ?
he &apos;ll be here tonight for the ball .
he &apos;ll go as a real cowboy with chaps and spurs and everything .
and Cupidon is going as-
Cupidon is ...
where at ?
he &apos;s probably hanging around those stables somewhere .
Cupidon is with him .
Ah , he can &apos;t be .
how do you know ?
everybody in the hotel is talking .
they have some big , dangerous plan .
Cupidon must have hid himself away somewhere when Mr. Clint went out , and now he &apos;s with him .
well , i &apos;ll whip him !
I &apos;ll take my riding crop , and i &apos;ll whip him !
what plan ?
what dangerous plan ?
it started at this Albany or someplace .
Mr. Clint and a whole crowd of men , taking each station along the way as if they was fighting a war .
if anything happens to Cupidon because of him , i &apos;ll kill him !
no ! Angelique , what stupid talk !
nothing will happen to them .
something frights me .
I got a feeling deep down- no , Angelique !
don &apos;t say such things !
I knew this Texas bring us bad luck .
I knew you &apos;d turn out like your mama- no luck with menfolks .
you fixing to marry a millionaire , and all the time you crazy in your head for that vache , and he leave you , just like Mr. Nicholas-
now ... let me fix you .
what &apos;s going on in here ?
that great cow .
what a to-do .
I could hear you way down the hall , screeching like a of couple fishwives .
listen , my child , old lady van Steed knows who you are .
she &apos;s going to expose you at the ball tonight .
she &apos;ll say nothing till she gets you in front of an audience , and then , squash- no more countess .
I shall not be at the ball .
you &apos;ve got to go . I got it up for you .
if Clint comes back , i &apos;ll go .
if Clint and Cupidon- you &apos;re an ungrateful brat- right when you &apos;re on the threshold of success if you don &apos;t weaken .
I know a man who &apos;s head over heels in love when i see one .
who ?
great heavens , she says &quot; who ? &quot;
why , Van Steed , of course .
he &apos;s what you want , isn &apos;t he ?
Yes , he &apos;s what i want .
good girl . he &apos;s on his way here now .
of course he &apos;s what i want .
I &apos;ve got to run- got a million things to do , running this ruckus .
I must keep remembering that . I must be sane .
but you got to stand up to his ma . I &apos;ll stand behind you .
just deny everything .
that &apos;s a trick i learned from my husband .
caught him cold once with a chorus girl .
he kept on denying it , looking me right in the eye until in the end , darned if i didn &apos;t believe the little liar .
you see ?
I &apos;m not going to be like mama .
I shall marry and be respectable and rich .
I shall have my life the way i said i should have it .
I really do look beautiful , don &apos;t i ?
am i as beautiful as my mother was ?
Yes , i am . I am .
Oh , there he is . one moment !
finish , Angelique .
vite .
you &apos;re shaking all over .
I &apos;m not .
I &apos;m Clio Dulaine ... and i &apos;m very calm .
is Mrs. Du Chenfrais in ?
dear Bart , good evening .
will you have a cocktail ?
Angelique , bring a cocktail for monsieur Van Steed .
no , thank you . I never drink .
my digestion .
I &apos;ve noticed that strong men so often have weak digestions .
I came to fetch you for the ball .
Oh , how sweet of you ... and brave .
you mean my mother .
how is your dear mother ?
I haven &apos;t felt her claws since the first delightful meeting on the piazza .
suppose we go down , and you can inquire of her health yourself ?
Oh , i should have loved it , but i &apos;m waiting for colonel Maroon .
Maroon &apos;s away .
Yes , i know- Albany .
tell me , isn &apos;t this Albany very near Saratoga ?
Yes , that &apos;s right .
but Mr. Van Steed , what manner of country is this ?
I hear there are hordes of roughs .
they fight-fight like savages for a railroad .
where are the laws ?
where are the police ?
that &apos;s nothing for you to worry your pretty head about .
that &apos;s a man &apos;s business .
and what are you doing about it- you , yourself , i mean ?
I &apos;m paying for it .
Oh , you coward .
you &apos;re afraid to fight for your own railroad .
you &apos;re afraid of your mother .
you &apos;re afraid of everything .
go away !
get out of my sight !
well , why don &apos;t you go ?
you know , you &apos;re delightful when you &apos;re angry .
I like a woman with spirit .
Clio , will you marry me ?
I &apos;m asking you to be my wife .
surprised , aren &apos;t you .
Yes , i am .
I &apos;ll surprise you a lot before i &apos;m through .
you say that i &apos;m afraid of my mother .
it &apos;s time that you understood about me and mother .
people think that i &apos;m tied to her apron strings .
mother &apos;s useful .
she shoos the women away , and i let her .
but when there &apos;s something or someone that i want , i get it .
you do the same thing , don &apos;t you ?
Yes , i do .
I schemed and tricked to get you .
Oh , i know that .
when a man has millions- i lied to you .
I &apos;m not a countess .
I &apos;m Clio Dulaine , and my mother was- i know exactly who you and your mother were .
my own mother told me , and i told her to mind her own business .
you &apos;re what i want , and i &apos;ve got what you want .
so what are we waiting for ?
mother &apos;s down in the ballroom now .
suppose we go down and see which one of us will back out- you or me ?
suppose we do .
congratulations , Bart .
Yes , yes . splendid .
how do they know ?
good news travels fast , doesn &apos;t it ?
must have been some scrap , eh , Bart ?
what has happened ?
by gosh , he did it , didn &apos;t he ?
who did what ?
knocked him sprawling . some man , that texan .
Clint !
too bad about colonel Maroon .
hear anything more definite ?
Clint !
what has happened to Clint ?
nothing .
we have to pay a price for everything .
tell me what you know .
people are looking . I &apos;ll tell you later .
no !
now !
we understand that the little dwarf was hurt .
do you want me to strike you in front of all these people ?
tell me what has happened to Clint ?
we heard he was hurt a little , but you know how he is- you &apos;re lying .
you &apos;re lying . he &apos;s dead . I can see it in your face .
he fought for you in a miserable raid-
Clint !
my , my , Mrs. Du Chenfrais , ma &apos;am , you look right pretty .
I reckon i &apos;m a sight .
Oh , Clint , cheri !
Clint !
Clint !
Clint !
I want to see the boss .
doctor say you stay in bed . you stay .
has he come to yet ?
I don &apos;t find out for one hour .
still fainted ? Womanish , huh ?
plum disgraceful to us Maroons .
the last thing i heard him say ,
&quot; here goes a Maroon , killed by a shovel . &quot;
I know .
I find out .
has he come to ?
honey ... yes , Clint ?
missed you .
missed you a lot . Oh , have you , my cheri ?
been away so long .
no , no . doesn &apos;t matter .
we &apos;re together now . ain &apos;t ever going to be separated again ?
no , my darling .
never , never , never .
I was a fool ... ought never have left Texas .
what ?
leaving you that way . sweetest little woman in Texas .
what ?
disposition like an angel .
but , cheri , i &apos;ve changed .
never hollering at a fella , never hightailing , letting me wear the pants .
but i &apos;m just like mama now , truly i am .
anyhow , i kept your tie .
don &apos;t know what i &apos;d done without it . look .
I &apos;m making one , too .
blue forget-me-nots . Yes .
look , cheri , look .
kept it around my neck always .
should have been a rope for some of the things i &apos;ve done .
some of the flowers are crooked , but i tried .
got myself mixed up with a foreign lady .
please don &apos;t say that .
I know you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re saying .
funny what kind of trouble you can get into just by talking to somebody on the street .
but i told Bart. I said i hated him .
got myself rich , too . but i said i didn &apos;t want to marry him , even with so much money .
I &apos;m rich up to my neck .
be richer , too , before i &apos;m through . I said i wanted to marry only you .
rich and respectable , that &apos;s me .
Oh , don &apos;t punish me anymore .
I &apos;ll cook for you .
I &apos;ll scrub for you .
if you leave me , wherever you go , i &apos;ll follow , and i &apos;ll find you .
I &apos;ll let you wear the pants .
honey , that &apos;s all i wanted to know .
Clint !
son of a gun !
we are quite , quite wrong .
once upon a time , there was a charming country house ... in which lived a very happily married couple .
- Edith , you know the cocktail shaker ? - Yes &apos;m .
well , I want you to fill two of those long-stemmed glasses from it ...
- and bring them up here . - Yes &apos;m .
and , Edith , as you &apos;re not in the navy , it &apos;s unnecessary to do everything at the double .
- And , Edith , when you &apos;re serving dinner ... try to remember to do it calmly and methodically .
- Yes &apos;m . - Now go and get the cocktails .
- Yes &apos;m . - Not at a run , Edith .
Yes &apos;m .
what do you suppose induced Agnes to leave us and go and get married ?
the reason was becoming increasingly obvious , dear .
Yes . we must keep Edith in the house more .
- Oh , dear ! - What &apos;s the matter ?
I have an idea this evening &apos;s going to be awful .
well , I think it &apos;ll be funny , but not awful .
why did you ask the Bradmans , darling ? he &apos;s as skeptical as we are .
- He &apos;ll probably say the most dreadful things . - Well , I warned him .
there had to be more than three of us , and we couldn &apos;t have the vicar and his wife ... because , A , they &apos;re dreary , and , B , they wouldn &apos;t have approved at all .
- No , it had to be the Bradmans . - You must promise not to catch my eye .
if I giggle - and I &apos;m very likely to - it will ruin everything .
you mustn &apos;t . you must be dead serious , and if possible , a little intense .
we can &apos;t hurt the old girl &apos;s feelings , however funny she is .
that was her .
Oh , that &apos;s her , is it ?
I &apos;ve seen her in the village several times .
she certainly is a strange woman .
the vicar told me he saw her up on the knoll on Midsummer Eve ... dressed in sort of Indian robes .
apparently , she &apos;s been a professional in London for years .
it &apos;s funny , isn &apos;t it ? I mean , to think of people doing it as a profession .
Hmm . I believe it &apos;s very lucrative .
what does Mr. Condomine hope to get out of her ?
material for his book . he &apos;s writing a mystery story , you know .
- To The Unseen . - I must say that &apos;s a wonderful title .
if this evening &apos;s a success , I shall start writing the first draft tomorrow .
used Elvira to be a help to you - when you were thinking something out , I mean ?
poor Elvira .
if I died before you &apos;d grown tired of me , I wonder if you &apos;d forget me so soon .
- What a horrible thing to say . - No , I think it &apos;s interesting .
well , to begin with , I haven &apos;t forgotten Elvira .
I remember her very distinctly indeed .
I remember how fascinating she was and how maddening .
I remember her gay charm when she had achieved her own way over something ... and her extreme acidity when she didn &apos;t .
I remember her physical attractiveness , which was tremendous ... and her spiritual integrity , which was nil .
was she more physically attractive than I am ?
that &apos;s a very tiresome question , darling , and fully deserves the wrong answer .
- You really are very sweet . - Thank you .
- And a little naive too . - Why ?
because you imagine that I mind about Elvira being more physically attractive than I am .
I love you , my love .
I know you do , but not the wildest stretch of the imagination could describe it ... as the first fine , careless rapture .
- Would you like it to be ?
- Good heavens , no .
wasn &apos;t that a shade too vehement ?
we &apos;re neither of us adolescent , Charles .
we &apos;ve neither of us led exactly prim lives , have we ?
we &apos;ve both been married before .
careless rapture at this stage would be incongruous and embarrassing .
I hope I haven &apos;t been in any way a disappointment , dear .
don &apos;t be so idiotic .
after all , your first husband was a great deal older than you .
I wouldn &apos;t like you to think that you &apos;ve missed out all along the line .
there are moments , Charles , when you go too far .
sorry , darling .
if I died , I wonder how long it would be before you married again .
you won &apos;t die . you &apos;re not the dying sort .
- Neither was Elvira .
- Oh , yes , she was , now I come to think of it .
she had a certain ethereal , not-quite-of-this-world quality .
nobody would call you even remotely ethereal .
nonsense . she was of the earth - earthy .
Yes . well , she is now anyhow .
you know , that &apos;s the kind of observation that shocks people .
it &apos;s discouraging to think how many people are shocked by honesty and how few by deceit .
write that down . you might forget it .
you underrate me .
anyhow , it was a question of bad taste more than honesty .
I was devoted to Elvira . we were married five years .
she died . I missed her very much .
that was seven years ago and I &apos;ve now , with your help , my love ... risen above the whole thing .
that &apos;s probably the Bradmans .
it might be Madame Arcati .
shall I go , or shall we let Edith have her fling ?
she &apos;s probably on one knee in a pre-sprinting position ... waiting for Cook to open the kitchen door .
- Steady , Edith . - Yes , sir .
good evening . we &apos;re not late , are we ?
I only got back from the hospital half an hour ago .
of course not . Madame Arcati isn &apos;t here yet .
no , we passed her coming up the hill on her bicycle .
I &apos;m so glad you were able to come . we &apos;ve been looking forward to it . I feel really quite excited .
I guarantee that Violet will be good . I made her promise .
fine . come and have a drink .
Oh , thank you so much .
do you believe in it , Mrs. Condomine ?
do you think there &apos;s anything really genuine about it at all ?
I &apos;m afraid not . but I do think it &apos;s interesting how easily ...
- Thank you . - People allow themselves to be deceived .
but she must believe it herself , mustn &apos;t she ? or is the whole business a fake ?
I suspect the worst . a real professional charlatan .
that &apos;s what I &apos;m hoping for anyhow .
the character that I &apos;m planning for my book must be a complete impostor .
it &apos;s one of the most important factors of the whole story .
do you think she tells fortunes ?
I love having my fortune told .
Yes , I expect so . have you ever attended her , Doctor ?
professionally , I mean ?
Oh , yes . she had influenza last January . she &apos;s only been here just over a year , you know .
here she is .
I say , she knows , doesn &apos;t she , about tonight ? you &apos;re not going to spring it on her ?
no , of course not . it was all arranged last week .
I told her how profoundly interested I was , and she blossomed like a rose .
I really feel quite nervous , as if I were going to make a speech .
- Go and meet her , darling . - Mmm .
- Oh , good evening . - Hmm ?
I &apos;ve leant my bike up against that little bush out there .
it &apos;ll be perfectly all right if no one touches it .
- How nice to see you , Madame Arcati . - My dear Madame Arcati .
I &apos;m afraid I &apos;m rather late , but I had a sudden presentiment ... that I was going to have a puncture , so I went back to fetch my pump .
and then , of course , I didn &apos;t have a puncture at all .
perhaps you will on the way home .
Oh , thank you .
- You know - - Dr. Bradman , the man with the gentle hands .
I &apos;m delighted to see you looking so well . this is my wife .
- How do you do ? - We &apos;re old friends . we meet coming out of shops .
would you like a cocktail ?
if it &apos;s a dry martini , yes . if it &apos;s a concoction , no .
experience has taught me to be very wary of concoctions .
- It is a dry martini . - How delicious .
we do so much appreciate your coming all this way , Madame Arcati .
Oh , nonsense . it was wonderful cycling through the woods this evening .
- I was deafened with birdsong . - It &apos;s been lovely all day .
Ah , but the evening &apos;s the time . mark my words .
thank you .
cheers !
cheers !
don &apos;t you find it tiring bicycling everywhere ?
on the contrary , it stimulates me . I was getting far too sedentary in London .
that horrid little flat with the dim lights .
they had to be dim , you know . the clients expect it .
this is the best dry martini I &apos;ve had for years .
- Would you like another ?
- Certainly .
I must say , I find bicycling very exhausting .
steady rhythm - that &apos;s what does it .
once you get the knack of it , you need never look back . on you get , and away you go .
but the hills , Madame Arcati . pushing up those awful hills .
just knack again .
down with your head , up with your heart , and you &apos;re over the top like a flash ... and skimming down the other side like a dragonfly .
- Dinner is served , ma &apos;am . - Thank you , Edith .
Oh , no red meat , I hope .
there &apos;s meat , but I don &apos;t think it will be very red .
I make it a rule never to eat red meat before I work .
would you rather have an egg or something ?
Oh , no , thank you . we &apos;ll risk it .
it &apos;s just that it sometimes has an odd effect .
- What sort of effect ? - Nothing of the least importance .
thank you .
how do you get in touch with people on the other side , Madame Arcati ?
through a control , of course . in my case , a little girl .
they &apos;re generally the best .
some mediums prefer Indians , of course , but personally I &apos;ve always found them unreliable .
in what way unreliable ?
well , to start with , they &apos;re frightfully lazy .
also , when faced with any sort of difficulty ... they &apos;re apt to go off into their own tribal language , which is naturally unintelligible .
that generally spoils everything and wastes a good deal of time .
do you feel funny when you go off into a trance ?
in what way &quot; funny &quot; ?
I don &apos;t think Mrs. Bradman means funny in its comic implication .
I think she meant strange or odd .
the word was an unfortunate choice .
Oh , I &apos;m sure I &apos;m very sorry .
it doesn &apos;t matter in the least . please don &apos;t apologize .
when did you first discover that you had these remarkable powers ?
when I was quite tiny .
my mother was a medium before me , you see ... and so I had every opportunity of starting on the ground floor , as you might say .
I had my first trance when I was four years old ... and my first ectoplasmic manifestation when I was five and a half .
Oh ! what an exciting day that was . I shall never forget it .
of course , the manifestation was quite small and of very short duration ... but for a child of my tender years , it was most gratifying .
- Can you tell fortunes ?
- Certainly not .
I disapprove of fortune tellers most strongly .
Edith , we don &apos;t want to be disturbed for the next hour or so for any reason whatsoever .
- Is that clear ?
- Yes &apos;m .
unless it &apos;s an urgent call for George .
- Unless it &apos;s an urgent call for Dr. Bradman . - Yes &apos;m .
well , Madame Arcati , the time is drawing near .
- Who knows ? it may be receding . - How very true .
I hope you feel in the mood , Madame Arcati .
well , it isn &apos;t a question of mood . it &apos;s a question of concentration .
you must forgive us being so impatient .
we can easily wait if you &apos;re not quite ready to start .
no , nonsense , my dear . I &apos;m absolutely ready .
heigh-ho ! heigh-ho ! to work we go .
- Is there anything you &apos;d like us to do ?
- Do ?
well , sort of hold hands or anything .
all that will come later . first , a few deep , deep breaths of fresh air .
you may talk , if you wish . it won &apos;t disturb me in the least .
Shh ! it was an excellent dinner , darling .
- I congratulate you . - The mousse wasn &apos;t quite right .
it looked a bit hysterical , but it tasted delicious .
- That cuckoo &apos;s very angry . - I beg your pardon .
I said that cuckoo is very angry . listen !
- How do you know ?
- Timbre .
no moon . that &apos;s as well , I think .
a mist rising from the marshes .
there &apos;s no need for me to light my bicycle lamp , is there ?
- I mean , no one &apos;s likely to fall over it . - No . we &apos;re not expecting anyone else .
splendid .
good night , you foolish bird .
- You have a table ?
- Well , we rather thought that one might do .
I think the one there would be better .
over here , Mr. Condomine , please .
Hmm .
this is a moment that I always hate .
- Are you nervous ?
- Yes .
- When I was a girl , I always used to be sick . - How fortunate that you grew out of it .
children are always much more prone to be sick than grown-ups though , aren &apos;t they ?
little Tommy Tucker sings for his supper . what shall he have but brown bread and butter ?
I despise that because it doesn &apos;t rhyme at all , but Daphne loves it .
who &apos;s Daphne ?
Daphne is Madame Arcati &apos;s control . she &apos;s the little girl .
Oh , yes . Yes , of course . I see .
- Rising seven when she died . - And when was that ?
February the sixth , 1884 .
she must be a bit long in the tooth by now , I should think .
you should think , Dr. Bradman , but I fear you don &apos;t , at least not profoundly enough .
please forgive me , Madame Arcati . I assure you I &apos;m deeply interested .
it &apos;s of no consequence .
now , will you all sit round the table , please , and place your hands downwards on it ?
- Come , Mrs. Bradman . - What about the lights ?
all in good time , Mr. Condomine .
now sit down , please .
that &apos;s better . I presume that &apos;s the gramophone .
would you like me to start it for you ?
it &apos;s an electric one .
no , no . please stay where you are . I can manage .
now , what have we here ? Brahms .
Oh , dear me , no .
Rachmaninoff - too florid .
- Where &apos;s the dance music ?
- They &apos;re the loose ones on the left .
I &apos;m afraid none of them are very new .
Daphne &apos;s really more attached to Irving Berlin than to anyone else .
she likes a tune she can hum . Oh , here &apos;s one - &quot; Always . &quot;
- &quot; Always &quot; ?
- What &apos;s the matter ?
uh - Nothing , darling . nothing at all .
now , there are one or two things that I would like to explain , so will you all listen attentively ?
of course .
presently , when the music begins , I &apos;m going to switch out the lights .
I may then either walk about the room for a little or lie down flat .
in due course , I shall draw up that dear little stool and join you at the table .
I shall place myself between you and your wife , Dr. Bradman ... and rest my hands lightly upon yours .
I must ask you not to address me or move or do anything in the least distracting .
- Is that quite , quite clear ?
- Perfectly .
of course , I can &apos;t guarantee that anything will happen at all .
Daphne may be unavailable .
she had a head cold recently and was rather under the weather , poor child .
on the other hand , a great many things might occur .
one of you might have an emanation , for instance .
or we might contact a poltergeist , which would be extremely destructive and noisy .
- In what way destructive ?
- They throw things , you know .
no , I didn &apos;t know .
now , are you ready to empty your minds ?
do you mean you want us to try and think of nothing ?
absolutely nothing , Dr. Bradman .
concentrate on a space or on a nondescript color .
- That &apos;s really the better way . - I &apos;ll do my level best .
good work !
lights !
Oh , dear !
is there anyone there ?
is there anyone there ?
one rap for yes . two raps for no .
is there anyone there ?
Oh !
is that you , Daphne ?
is your cold better , dear ?
Oh , I &apos;m so sorry . are you doing anything for it ?
I &apos;m afraid she &apos;s very fretful .
is there anyone there who wishes to speak to anyone here ?
Ah . now we &apos;re getting somewhere . Oh , no , Daphne .
don &apos;t do that , dear .
you &apos;re hurting me . Daphne dear , please !
Oh , be good . there &apos;s a dear child .
I &apos;m sorry .
you say there &apos;s someone there who wishes to speak to someone here ?
is it me ?
is it Dr. Bradman ?
is it Mrs. Bradman ?
is it Mrs. Condomine ?
Oh , stop it , Daphne . behave yourself .
is it Mr. Condomine ?
there &apos;s someone who wishes to speak to you , Mr. Condomine .
tell them to leave a message .
I really must ask you not to be flippant , Mr. Condomine .
Charles , how can you be so idiotic ? you &apos;ll spoil everything .
I &apos;m sorry . it just slipped out .
do you know anyone who &apos;s passed over recently ?
not recently , except my cousin in the civil service ... and he wouldn &apos;t be likely to want to communicate with me .
we haven &apos;t spoken for years .
are you Mr. Condomine &apos;s cousin in the civil service ?
no , I &apos;m afraid we &apos;ve drawn a blank .
try and think of someone else . rack your brains .
it might be old Mrs. Plummett , you know . she died on Whit Monday .
I can &apos;t imagine why old Mrs. Plummett should wish to speak to me .
- We had very little in common . - It &apos;s worth trying .
are you old Mrs. Plummett ?
she was deaf . perhaps you &apos;d better shout .
are you old Mrs. Plummett ?
no , there &apos;s nobody there at all .
how disappointing . just as we were getting on so nicely .
Violet , be quiet .
well , I &apos;m afraid there &apos;s nothing for it but for me to go into a trance .
excuse me a moment while I start the gramophone again .
- Not &quot; Always . &quot; don &apos;t play &quot; Always . &quot;
- I &apos;m afraid I must .
it would be imprudent to change horses in midstream , if you know what I mean .
Oh , well . have it your own way .
little Tommy Tucker sings for his supper .
what shall we give him ... but brown bread and butter ?
that would be Daphne . she ought to have had her adenoids out .
George , please !
- Good heavens .
- Shh !
it &apos;s trying to get away . I can &apos;t hold it .
press down hard .
ought we to pick it up or leave it where it is ?
- How the devil should I know ? - Well , there &apos;s no need to snap at me .
- I suppose we &apos;d better pick it up . - Leave it where it is .
- Who said that ?
- Who said what ?
- Somebody said , &quot; Leave it where it is . &quot; - Nonsense , dear .
- I heard it distinctly . - Nobody else did , did they ?
I never heard a sound .
it was you , Ruth . you &apos;re playing tricks .
I &apos;m doing nothing of the sort . I haven &apos;t uttered .
good evening , Charles .
ventriloquism . that &apos;s what it is - ventriloquism .
- What &apos;s the matter with you ?
- You must have heard that .
- One of you must have heard that . - Heard what ?
you mean to sit there solemnly and tell me that none of you heard anything at all ?
- I certainly didn &apos;t . - Neither did I. I wish I had .
I should love to hear something .
it &apos;s you who are playing the tricks , Charles . you &apos;re acting to try and frighten us .
I &apos;m not . I swear I &apos;m not .
it &apos;s difficult to think of what to say after seven years ... but I suppose that &quot; good evening &quot; is as good as anything else .
- Who are you ? - Elvira , of course . don &apos;t be so silly .
I can &apos;t bear this another minute . get up , everybody . the entertainment &apos;s over .
Charles , how tiresome of you . just as we were beginning to enjoy ourselves .
never again . that &apos;s all I can say . never , never again , as long as I live .
did you hear something we didn &apos;t hear , really ?
- No , of course not . I was only pretending . - I knew you were .
Oh , dear ! look at Madame Arcati .
- What are we to do with her ? - Bring her round .
bring her round as soon as possible .
she &apos;s out , all right .
bring her round . it &apos;s dangerous to leave her like this .
really , Charles , you &apos;re behaving most peculiarly .
Madame Arcati , wake up ! time to go home !
- Now steady , steady on . - Get some brandy . give her some brandy .
what on earth is the matter with you ?
get some brandy !
here , Bradman , give me a - Help me . I &apos;ll take the feet .
lift her into the chair .
wake up , Madame Arcati .
little Tommy Tucker , Madame Arcati !
here &apos;s the brandy .
she &apos;s coming round .
be careful , Charles . you &apos;re spilling it down her dress .
well , that &apos;s that .
- Are you all right ?
- Certainly I am , my dear .
I never felt better in my life .
well , what happened ?
was it satisfactory ?
Oh , nothing much happened , Madame Arcati , after you went off .
no , something happened , all right . I can feel it .
no poltergeists at any rate . that &apos;s a good thing .
- Any apparitions ?
- Not a thing .
what , no ectoplasm ?
I &apos;m not quite sure what that is , but I don &apos;t think so .
curious . I feel as if something tremendous had taken place .
Charles pretended he heard a voice to try and frighten us .
it was only a joke .
a poor one , if I may say so .
nevertheless , I &apos;m prepared to swear that there &apos;s someone else psychic in this room apart from myself .
I don &apos;t really see how there could be , Madame Arcati .
I do hope I haven &apos;t gone and released something .
however , we are bound to find out within a day or two .
if any manifestations should occur or you hear any unexpected noises ... you might let me know at once .
Oh , of course we will . we &apos;ll get in touch with you immediately .
- Well , I really think I must be on my way now . - Wouldn &apos;t you like something before you go ?
Oh , no , thank you . I have some Ovaltine all ready in a saucepan at home .
it only needs hotting up . Good-bye , Mrs. Condomine .
it was sweet of you to take all this trouble .
well , I &apos;m so sorry so little occurred . it &apos;s that cold of Daphne &apos;s , I expect .
you know what children are when there &apos;s anything wrong with them .
- We must try again some other evening . - That would be lovely .
- Good night , Mrs. Bradman . - It was thrilling . it really was .
I felt the table absolutely shaking under my hands .
- Good night , Doctor . - Congratulations , Madame Arcati .
I &apos;m fully aware of the irony in your voice , Dr. Bradman .
as a matter of fact , you &apos;d make an excellent subject for telepathic hypnosis .
a great chum of mine &apos;s an expert . I &apos;d like her to look you over .
I &apos;m sure I should be charmed .
- Well , good night , everyone . - Good night .
good night .
thank you . next time we must really put our backs into it .
good night .
be careful , Mrs. Condomine . she might hear you .
I can &apos;t help it . I &apos;ve been holding this in for ages .
but do you really think she believes -
of course not . the whole thing &apos;s a put-up job .
I must say , though , she shoots a more original line than they generally do .
I hope Mr. Condomine got all the atmosphere he wanted for his book .
he would have got a great deal more if he hadn &apos;t spoiled it by showing off .
I &apos;m really very cross with him .
I suddenly felt a draft . there must be a window open .
no , they &apos;re shut .
perhaps it was one of those whatchamacallims Madame Arcati was talking about .
- Elementals ?
- No , it couldn &apos;t be .
she distinctly said it was the wrong time of the year for elementals .
well , the old girl went pedaling off down the drive at a hell of a speed .
- We had a bit of trouble lighting her lamp . - Poor thing .
I &apos;ve got a theory about her , you know .
- I believe she &apos;s completely sincere . - Charles , how could she be ?
well , we must be going . I &apos;ve got to get up abominably early tomorrow .
I have a patient being operated on in Canterbury .
it &apos;s been a thrilling evening . I shall never forget it .
- It was sweet of you to include us . - Good night , Mrs. Condomine . thank you so much .
are you sure you won &apos;t have a drink before you go ?
quite sure , thanks .
I must do a little reading up on the whole business , just for the fun of it .
we &apos;ll let you know if we find any poltergeists whirling about .
- I should never forgive you if you didn &apos;t . - Come along , darling .
- Well , darling ? - Well ?
would you say the evening had been profitable ?
Mmm . I suppose so .
- What &apos;s the matter ? - Matter ?
Yes . you seem odd somehow .
- Do you feel quite well ? - Mmm , fine .
- I think I &apos;ll have a drink . do you want one ?
- No , thank you , dear .
Brr ! it &apos;s getting very chilly -
Oh , my God !
Charles !
that was very clumsy , Charles dear .
Elvira , then it &apos;s true .
it - It was you .
of course it was .
Charles , darling . Charles , what are you talking about ?
are you a - a ghost ?
I suppose I must be .
it &apos;s all very confusing .
what do you keep looking over there for ?
look at me . what &apos;s happened ?
- Don &apos;t you see ?
- See what ?
Elvira .
- Elvira ? - Yes .
Elvira dear , this is Ruth . Ruth , this is Elvira .
come and sit down , darling .
what , do you mean to say you can &apos;t see her ?
look , Charles , you just sit down quietly by the fire , and I &apos;ll fix you another drink .
don &apos;t worry about the mess on the carpet . Edith can clean that up in the morning .
but you must be able to see her . she &apos;s here . look .
right in front of you here .
look , Charles , if this is a joke , it &apos;s gone far enough .
- Now sit down and don &apos;t be idiotic . - What am I to do ?
what the devil am I to do ?
well , I really think you might be a little more pleased to see me .
after all , you conjured me up .
I didn &apos;t do any such thing .
nonsense . of course you did .
that awful child with the cold came and told me that you wanted to see me urgently .
it was all a mistake , a horrible mistake .
stop talking like that , Charles . as I told you before , the joke &apos;s gone far enough .
I &apos;ve gone mad . that &apos;s what it is .
I &apos;ve just gone raving mad .
now sit down .
why are you so anxious for me to sit down ? what good will that do ?
I want you to relax . you can &apos;t relax standing up .
African natives can . they can stand on one leg for hours .
I don &apos;t happen to be an African native .
- You don &apos;t happen to be a what ?
- An African native .
what &apos;s that got to do with it ?
it doesn &apos;t matter , Ruth . it really doesn &apos;t matter .
we will say no more about it .
- Look . I &apos;ve sat down . - Here .
- Would you like some more ? - Yes , please .
very unwise . you always had a weak head .
I could drink you under the table .
there &apos;s no need to be aggressive , Charles . I &apos;m doing my best to help you .
sorry .
now , drink this , and then we can go upstairs to bed .
get rid of her , Charles . then we can talk in peace .
that &apos;s a thoroughly immoral suggestion . you ought to be ashamed of yourself .
what is there immoral in that ?
- I wasn &apos;t talking to you , Ruth . - Who were you talking to then ?
- Elvira , of course . - Oh , to blazes with Elvira !
- There now . she &apos;s getting cross . - I don &apos;t blame her .
now look here , Charles . I gather you &apos;ve got some sort of plan behind all this .
- I &apos;m not quite a fool . - Ruth , Elvira is here .
she &apos;s standing a few yards away from you .
Yes , dear . I can see her distinctly - under the piano with a zebra .
- But , Ruth - - I am not going to stay here arguing any longer .
- Hooray . - Shut up .
- How dare you speak to me like that ! - But listen , Ruth , please -
I will not listen to any more of this nonsense .
I &apos;m going upstairs to bed now . I shall leave you to turn out the lights .
I won &apos;t be asleep - I &apos;m much too upset - so you can come in and say good night to me if you feel like it .
well , that &apos;s big of her , I must say .
be quiet !
you &apos;re behaving like a guttersnipe .
that is all I have to say .
good night , Charles .
that was one of the most enjoyable half hours I &apos;ve ever spent .
- Oh , Elvira , how could you ? - Poor Ruth .
this is obviously some sort of hallucination , isn &apos;t it ?
I &apos;m afraid I don &apos;t know the technical term for it .
well , where have you come from ?
do you know , it &apos;s very peculiar , but I &apos;ve sort of forgotten .
are you to be here indefinitely ?
I &apos;m afraid I don &apos;t know that either .
why ? would you hate it so much if I was ?
well , you must admit it would be embarrassing .
I don &apos;t see why really . it &apos;s all a question of adjusting yourself .
anyway , I think it &apos;s horrid of you to be so unwelcoming and disagreeable .
- Now look here , Elvira . - I do . I think you &apos;re mean .
well , try to see my point of view , dear . I &apos;ve been married to Ruth for five years and you &apos;ve been dead for seven .
not dead , Charles . passed over .
it &apos;s considered very vulgar to say &quot; dead &quot; where I come from .
passed over then .
I don &apos;t believe you love me anymore .
I shall always love the memory of you .
well , I really am a little hurt .
you called me back , and at greet inconvenience I came ... and you &apos;ve been thoroughly churlish ever since I arrived .
believe me , Elvira , I most emphatically did not call you back .
- There &apos;s been some mistake . - Perhaps it was your subconscious .
you must find out if you &apos;re going to stay or not , and we can make arrangements accordingly .
- I don &apos;t see how I can . - Well , try and think .
isn &apos;t there anyone that you know that you can get in touch with over there ... or on the other side or whatever it &apos;s called who can advise you ?
no . I can &apos;t think .
it all seems so far away , as though I &apos;d dreamed it .
Oh , Charles .
what is it ?
- I want to cry , but I don &apos;t think I &apos;m able to . - What do you want to cry for ?
well , it &apos;s seeing you again , and you being so irascible like you always used to be .
- I don &apos;t mean to be irascible , Elvira . - Darling , I don &apos;t mind really . I never did .
is it cold being a ghost ?
no , I don &apos;t think so .
what happens if I touch you ?
I doubt if you can .
do you want to ?
Oh , Elvira .
what is it , darling ?
Oh , it certainly does seem strange seeing you again .
that &apos;s better .
what &apos;s better ?
your voice was kinder .
was I ever unkind to you when you were alive ?
often .
Oh , how can you ? I &apos;m sure you &apos;re exaggerating .
not at all .
you were an absolute pig that time we went to Cornwall and stayed in that awful hotel .
you hit me with a billiard cue .
Mmm . only very , very gently .
I loved you very much .
I loved you too .
no , I can &apos;t touch you . isn &apos;t that horrible ?
Hmm . perhaps it &apos;s just as well if I &apos;m to stay here for any length of time .
I suppose I shall wake up eventually , but I feel strangely peaceful now .
that &apos;s right . put your head back .
like this ?
can you feel anything ?
only a very little breeze through my hair .
well , that &apos;s better than nothing .
I suppose if I &apos;m really out of my mind , they &apos;ll put me in an asylum .
don &apos;t you worry about that . just relax .
poor Ruth .
Mmm . nuts to Ruth .
good morning , Edith .
- Good morning , sir . - Feeling fit ?
Yes , sir . thank you , sir .
- How &apos;s Cook ? - I don &apos;t know , sir . I haven &apos;t asked her .
you should . you should begin every day by asking everyone how they are .
- It oils the wheels . - Yes , sir .
- Greet her for me , will you ?
- Yes , sir .
- Good morning , darling . - Good morning , Charles .
- It certainly is . - What certainly is what ?
a good morning . a tremendously good morning .
there isn &apos;t a cloud in the sky , and everything looks newly washed .
anything interesting in The Times ?
don &apos;t be silly , Charles .
- I intend to work all day . - Good .
- It &apos;s extraordinary about daylight , isn &apos;t it ?
- How do you mean ?
Oh , the way it reduces everything to normal .
I &apos;m sure I &apos;m very glad to hear it .
- You &apos;re very glacial this morning . - Are you surprised ?
Yes . I take back what I said about it being a good morning . it &apos;s a horrid morning .
you &apos;d better eat your breakfast while it &apos;s hot .
it isn &apos;t .
now look here , Charles .
in your younger days , this display of roguish flippancy might have been alluring .
in a middle-aged novelist , it &apos;s nauseating .
- I don &apos;t see what I &apos;ve done that &apos;s so awful . - You behaved abominably last night .
you wounded me and insulted me .
I was the victim of an aberration .
- Nonsense . you were drunk . - Drunk ?
you had two strong dry martinis before dinner , a great deal too much burgundy at dinner ... heaven knows how much port and kümmel with Dr. Bradman ... while I was doing my best to entertain that madwoman .
and two large brandies later . I gave them to you myself .
- Of course you were drunk . - That &apos;s your story , is it ?
I wasn &apos;t in the least drunk , Ruth . something happened to me last night .
something very peculiar happened to me .
- I really don &apos;t wish to discuss it any further . - But you must discuss it . it &apos;s very disturbing .
I swear to you that during the séance I was convinced I heard Elvira &apos;s voice .
- Nobody else did . - I can &apos;t help that . I did .
you couldn &apos;t have .
and later on , I was equally convinced she was in the room .
I saw her distinctly and talked to her .
after you &apos;d gone up to bed , we had quite a cozy little chat .
and you seriously expect me to believe that you weren &apos;t drunk .
I know I wasn &apos;t drunk . if I &apos;d been all that drunk , I should have a dreadful hangover , shouldn &apos;t I ?
- I &apos;m not at all sure that you haven &apos;t . - I haven &apos;t got a trace of a headache .
my tongue &apos;s not coated . look at it .
I haven &apos;t the least desire to look at your tongue . kindly put it in again .
- Please &apos;m . - Yes , Edith ?
cook wants to know about lunch , ma &apos;am .
- Will you be in to lunch , Charles ?
- Oh , please , don &apos;t worry about me .
I shall be perfectly happy with a bottle of gin in my bedroom .
don &apos;t be silly , dear . tell Cook we shall both be in , Edith .
Yes &apos;m .
I &apos;m going into Hythe this morning . is there anything you want ?
Yes , a great deal , but I doubt if you could get it in Hythe .
I &apos;ve put Alka-Seltzer down on my list .
women !
what I think of women .
your view of women is academic , to say the least of it .
just because you &apos;ve always been dominated by them ... it doesn &apos;t necessarily follow that you know anything about them .
I &apos;ve never been dominated by anyone .
you were hagridden by your mother till you were 23 .
then you got into the clutches of that awful Mrs. Whatever-her-name-was .
- Mrs. Winthrop-Llewellyn . - I &apos;m not interested .
then there was Elvira . she ruled you with a rod of iron .
Elvira never ruled anyone . she was far too elusive .
that was one of her greatest charms .
then there was Maud Charteris .
if you wish to make an inventory of my sex life , dear ...
I think it only fair to tell you that you &apos;ve missed out several episodes .
I &apos;ll consult my diary and give you a complete list after lunch .
- Charles . - Yes ?
alcohol will ruin your whole life if you allow it to get a hold on you , you know .
once and for all , Ruth , I &apos;d like you to understand ... that what happened last night was nothing whatever to do with alcohol .
I grant you , it may have been some form of psychic delusion ... but I was stone-cold sober from first to last and extremely upset into the bargain .
you were upset indeed . what about me ?
you behaved with a stolid , obtuse lack of comprehension which frankly shocked me .
instead of putting out a gentle , comradely hand to guide me ... you shouted staccato orders at me like a sergeant major .
you called me a guttersnipe . you told me to shut up .
and when I quietly suggested that we should go upstairs to bed ... you said , with the most disgusting leer , it was an immoral suggestion .
I was talking to Elvira .
if you were , I can only say it conjures up a fragrant picture of your first marriage .
my first marriage was perfectly charming and I think it &apos;s in the worst possible taste for you to sneer at it .
I &apos;m not nearly so interested in your first marriage as you seem to think I am .
it &apos;s your second marriage that is absorbing me at the moment . it seems to me to be on the rocks .
only because you persist in taking up this ridiculous attitude .
my attitude is that of any normal woman whose husband gets drunk and hurls abuse at her .
- I was not drunk !
- Be quiet .
they &apos;ll hear you in the kitchen .
I don &apos;t care if they hear me in the Folkestone town hall !
I was not drunk !
- Did you call , sir ?
- No !
Charles dear , if you weren &apos;t drunk , how do you account for it ?
I can &apos;t account for it . that &apos;s what &apos;s so awful .
- What did you have for lunch ?
- You ought to know . you had it with me .
let me see . there was lemon sole and that cheese thing .
why should having a cheese thing for lunch make me see my deceased wife after dinner ?
you never know . it was rather rich .
why didn &apos;t you see your dead husband then ?
you had just as much of it as I did .
- This isn &apos;t getting us anywhere . - No , of course it isn &apos;t .
- Charles dear ?
- Yes ?
perhaps there &apos;s something pressing on your brain .
if there were something pressing on my brain , I should have violent headaches , shouldn &apos;t I ?
not necessarily .
an uncle of mine had a lump the size of a cricket ball pressing on his brain for years ... and he never felt a thing .
I know I should know if I had anything like that .
- He didn &apos;t . - What happened to him ?
he had it taken out , and he &apos;s been as bright as a button ever since .
did he have any sort of delusions ?
I mean , did he think he saw things that weren &apos;t there ?
no , I don &apos;t think so .
well , what the blazes are we talking about him for then ?
it &apos;s sheer waste of valuable time .
well , I just brought him up as an example .
- How do you feel now ?
- Physically , do you mean ?
altogether .
apart from being worried , I feel quite normal .
good . you &apos;re not seeing or hearing anything in the least unusual ?
not a thing .
what &apos;s the matter now ?
she &apos;s here again !
- What do you mean ?
who &apos;s here again ?
- Elvira .
you &apos;ve absolutely ruined that border by the sundial .
it looks like a mixed salad .
Charles , pull yourself together .
it &apos;s all those nasturtiums . they &apos;re so vulgar .
- I like nasturtiums . - You like what ?
they &apos;re all right in moderation , but in a mass like that , they look beastly .
help me , Ruth . you &apos;ve got to help me .
- What did you mean about nasturtiums ?
- Never mind about that now .
I tell you , she &apos;s here again .
you &apos;ve been having some nice scenes , haven &apos;t you ?
please mind your own business .
if you behaving like a lunatic isn &apos;t my business , I don &apos;t know what is .
I expect they were about me , weren &apos;t they ?
I know I ought to feel sorry , but I &apos;m not . I &apos;m delighted .
- How can you be so inconsiderate ?
- Inconsiderate ?
I like that . I &apos;ve done everything I can to help .
I &apos;ve controlled myself admirably .
and I &apos;d like to say here and now I don &apos;t believe a word about your beastly hallucinations .
- Ruth , please . - Don &apos;t come near me !
let her have a nice cry . it &apos;ll do her good .
- You &apos;re utterly heartless . - Heartless !
I wasn &apos;t talking to you ! I was talking to Elvira !
very well . go on talking to her then .
talk to her till you &apos;re blue in the face , but don &apos;t talk to me .
- Help me , Elvira . - How ?
- Well , make her see you or something . - Oh , I &apos;m afraid I couldn &apos;t possibly manage that .
it &apos;s technically the most difficult business - frightfully complicated , you know .
it takes years of study .
I don &apos;t care how technical it is . you &apos;ve got to try .
you are here , aren &apos;t you ?
you &apos;re not an illusion ?
no , I was afraid not .
Yes , but - Well -
no , I don &apos;t mean to be rude , but you must see -
Yes , you must make me a promise in future you &apos;ll only come and talk to me when I &apos;m alone .
well , that &apos;s better than not seeing me at all .
- Charles . - Yes , dear ?
I &apos;m awfully sorry I was cross .
- But , my dear - - I understand everything now .
- I do really . - You do ?
- Of course I do . - Look out . she &apos;s up to something .
- Will you please be quiet ?
- Of course , darling .
we &apos;ll all be quiet , won &apos;t we ?
we &apos;ll be as quiet as little mice .
but , Ruth dear -
now , I want you to come upstairs with me and go to bed .
the way that woman harps on bed .
- I &apos;ll deal with you later . - Very well , darling . come along .
- What are you up to ?
- I &apos;m not up to anything .
I just want you to go quietly to bed and wait there till Dr. Bradman comes .
no , Ruth , you &apos;re wrong .
she &apos;ll have you in a straitjacket before you know where you are .
listen , Ruth . if I promise to go to bed , will you let me stay here for five minutes longer ?
- I really think it would be much better - - No , now bear with me .
however mad it may seem , bear with me for just five minutes longer .
very well . what is it ?
sit down .
- All right . there . - Now listen .
have a cigarette . it &apos;ll soothe your nerves .
- I don &apos;t want a cigarette . - Then you shan &apos;t have one , darling .
I want to explain to you calmly and without emotion ... that beyond any shadow of doubt , the ghost or shade or whatever you like to call it ... of my first wife , Elvira , is in this room now .
Yes , dear .
I know you don &apos;t believe me and you &apos;re trying valiantly to humor me ... but I &apos;m going to prove it to you .
- Promise you &apos;ll do what I ask . - Well , that depends on what it is .
Ruth , you see this bowl of flowers on the table ?
Yes , dear , I did them myself this morning .
- Very untidily , if I may say so . - You may not .
very well . I never will again , I promise .
Elvira will now carry the bowl of flowers over to you and back again .
you will , Elvira , won &apos;t you ?
just to please me ?
well , just once , please .
thank you . now watch carefully , Ruth .
Yes , dear .
go on , Elvira . take them over to Ruth .
how dare you , Charles ?
you ought to be ashamed of yourself .
what on earth for ?
it &apos;s a trick . I know it &apos;s a trick .
you &apos;ve been working up to this . it &apos;s all part of some horrible plan .
it isn &apos;t . I swear it isn &apos;t .
Elvira , for heaven &apos;s sake , do something else .
certainly . anything to oblige .
you want to get rid of me . you &apos;re trying to drive me out of my mind !
- Oh !
- I &apos;m not going to put up with this any longer !
- You must believe me !
you must !
- Let me go immediately !
- That was Elvira ! I swear it was . - Let me go .
Ruth , please !
Charles , this is madness , sheer madness .
it &apos;s some sort of autosuggestion , isn &apos;t it ?
some form of hypnotism .
- Swear to me it &apos;s only that . - Hypnotism , my foot !
Oh , my dear Mrs. Condomine , how nice of you to call .
- I do hope it isn &apos;t inconvenient .
- Inconvenient ? good heavens , no .
come inside .
Oh , do go into the sitting room , Mrs. Condomine .
you &apos;re just in time for a cup of tea - that is , if you don &apos;t mind China .
- Not at all . - I never touch Indian . it upsets my vibrations .
well , do come and sit down .
good egg . I &apos;ll have this made in a jiffy .
Madame Arcati , I &apos;m profoundly disturbed , and I want your help .
splendid . I thought as much . now , fire away .
well , it &apos;s most awfully difficult to explain .
well , facts first . explanations afterwards .
it &apos;s the facts that are so difficult to explain . they &apos;re so fantastic .
facts very often are .
come now , take the plunge . out with it .
you &apos;ve heard strange noises in the night , no doubt .
boards creaking , doors slamming .
subdued moaning in the passages .
- Isn &apos;t that it ? - No , I &apos;m afraid it isn &apos;t .
no sudden gusts of cold wind , I hope ?
no . it &apos;s worse than that .
I &apos;m all attention .
I know it sounds idiotic ... but the other night , during the séance , something happened .
I knew it .
probably a poltergeist .
they &apos;re enormously cunning , you know .
they sometimes lie doggo for days .
poltergeist !
poltergeist !
pretty poltergeist !
Oh !
now carry on . I &apos;m all ears .
you know my husband was married before .
Yes . I had heard it mentioned .
his first wife , Elvira , died comparatively young .
she was convalescing from pneumonia , and , one evening ... she began to laugh helplessly at one of the BBC musical programs ... and died of a heart attack .
just a moment , please .
- Now , where did she die ?
- In our present house .
I &apos;m beginning to see daylight .
she materialized the other evening after I &apos;d gone .
not to me , but to my husband .
capital !
capital ! Oh , but that &apos;s splendid !
at last ! at last ! a genuine materialization !
please sit down , Madame Arcati .
how could anyone sit down at such a moment ? it &apos;s tremendous .
I haven &apos;t had such a success since the Sudbury case .
nevertheless , I must insist upon you sitting down ... and controlling your natural exuberance .
I fully appreciate your pride in your achievement ... but I would like to point out it &apos;s made my position in the house untenable ... and I hold you entirely responsible .
Oh , forgive me , Mrs. Condomine . I &apos;m being abominably selfish .
- How can I help you ?
- How ?
by sending her back immediately to where she came from , of course .
well , where is she now ?
my husband &apos;s driven her into Folkestone .
apparently she was anxious to see an old friend of hers who &apos;s staying at the Grand .
this whole business is very difficult for Ruth . we must be fair .
well , she should learn to be more adaptable .
she probably will in time .
I doubt it , Charles .
she &apos;s got a hard mouth . it &apos;s her mouth that gives her away .
her mouth &apos;s got nothing to do with it .
I resent your discussing Ruth as though she were a horse .
I - I take it your husband was devoted to her .
I believe so .
husband devoted .
it was apparently a reasonably happy marriage .
Oh , tut , tut , tut .
you say she &apos;s visible only to your husband ?
Yes .
visible only ... to husband .
audible , too , I presume .
extremely audible .
extremely ... audible .
do you love her ?
Yes , of course .
as much as you loved me ?
don &apos;t be silly . it &apos;s entirely different .
you always behaved very badly ... and I &apos;m grieved to see that your sojourn in the other world ... hasn &apos;t improved you in the least .
the time has come for me to admit to you frankly , Mrs. Condomine ... that I haven &apos;t the faintest idea how to get rid of her .
do you mean to sit there and tell me ... that having mischievously conjured up this ghost or spirit or whatever she is ... and placed me in a hideous position ... you are unable to do anything about it ?
well , honesty is the best policy .
but this is outrageous . I - I ought to hand you over to the police .
you go too far , Mrs. Condomine .
I go too far ?
indeed .
do you realize what your insane , amateur muddling has done ?
I have been a professional ever since I was a child , Mrs. Condomine .
&quot; amateur &quot; is a word that I cannot tolerate .
it seems to me to be the height of amateurishness ... to evoke malignant spirits and not be able to get rid of them .
I resent your tone , Mrs. Condomine . I really do .
you most decidedly have no right to .
you are to blame for the whole horrible situation .
may I remind you that I came to your house on your own invitation .
on my husband &apos;s invitation .
the whole thing was planned in order for him to get material ... for a mystery story he &apos;s writing about a homicidal medium .
am I to understand that I was only invited in a spirit of mockery ?
no , no , no . not at all . he merely wanted to make notes of some of the tricks of the trade .
tricks of the trade ?
insufferable !
I &apos;ve never been so insulted in my life !
I feel we have nothing more to say to one another , Mrs. Condomine .
but , Madame Arcati , please .
your attitude from the outset has been most unpleasant .
some of your remarks have been discourteous in the extreme .
and I would like to say , without umbrage ... that if you and your husband have been foolish enough to tamper with the unseen ... for paltry motives and in a spirit of ribaldry ... whatever has happened to you is your own fault .
and to coin a phrase ... as far as I &apos;m concerned , you can stew in your own juice !
good afternoon , Mrs. Condomine .
what on earth are you doing here ?
- I &apos;ve been calling on Madame Arcati . - Whatever for ?
to get rid of me , of course . to get me exorcized .
- Is that true , Ruth ?
- Is what true ?
that you went to Madame Arcati to get Elvira exorcised .
we discussed the possibilities .
there &apos;s a snake in the grass for you .
I &apos;m afraid Elvira &apos;s sitting here .
Oh , to blazes with Elvira !
you know , Charles , she &apos;s absolutely ruined this room .
she &apos;s done nothing of the kind .
it &apos;s all a question of taste .
my poor darling Charles .
as far as taste is concerned , your second marriage was a disaster .
just look at that awful picture and that terrifying dress .
- But what &apos;s the matter with it ?
- What &apos;s the matter with what ?
I think it &apos;s very charming .
really , this situation is impossible , and you know it .
if only you &apos;d make an effort to be a little more friendly to Elvira ... we might all have quite a jolly time .
I have no wish to have a jolly time with Elvira .
she &apos;s certainly very bad-tempered , isn &apos;t she ?
I can &apos;t think why you married her .
- Where is she at the moment ?
- She &apos;s on the - Mmm ? in the chair .
Oh , you are sweet , Charles darling .
I worship you .
I want to be perfectly frank with you , Elvira .
hold on to your hats , boys .
I admit I did see Madame Arcati with a view to having you exorcized .
I think if you &apos;d been in my position , you would have done exactly the same .
what did Madame Arcati say ?
- She said she couldn &apos;t do a thing . - Hooray .
don &apos;t be upset , Ruth dear . we shall adjust ourselves , you know .
you must admit it &apos;s a unique position .
I can see no reason why we shouldn &apos;t get a great deal of fun out of it .
fun ?
how can you , Charles ?
- You must be out of your mind . - Yes , I thought I was at first .
but now I must admit I &apos;m beginning to enjoy myself .
Oh !
this is intolerable !
for heaven &apos;s sake , don &apos;t get into another state .
I have been doing my level best to control myself since yesterday morning ... and I am not going to do it anymore !
I don &apos;t like Elvira any more than she likes me .
and what &apos;s more , I &apos;m sure I never could have - dead or alive .
Lf , since her untimely arrival the other evening ... she &apos;d shown the slightest sign of good manners , the slightest sign of breeding ...
I might have felt differently toward her .
as it is , all she &apos;s done is try to make mischief between us ... to have private jokes with you against me .
first thing tomorrow , I &apos;m going up to London to interview the Psychical Research Society .
and if they fail me , I shall go straight to the Archbishop of Canterbury .
I shall be back on the 6 : 45 .
you and Elvira can have the house to yourselves ... and joke and gossip with each other to your heart &apos;s content .
it &apos;s clouding over .
you have a genius for understatement .
Edith !
cook . what on earth &apos;s happened ?
where &apos;s Edith ?
Charles .
nothing to worry about , Mrs. Condomine . it &apos;s only a slight strain .
Oh !
I &apos;m so relieved . but who was in the ambulance ?
that , dear , was the gardener .
men are much worse patients than women , you know .
- Particularly highly strung men like your husband . - Is he highly strung , do you think ?
- I &apos;m afraid he &apos;s been overworking lately . - Overworking ?
he &apos;s in rather a nervous condition . nothing serious , you understand .
- What makes you think so ?
- I know the symptoms .
what symptoms ?
Oh , it &apos;s nothing to be unduly alarmed about .
a certain air of strain , an inability to focus his eyes on the person he &apos;s talking to ... a few rather marked irrelevancies in his conversation .
I see . can you remember any specific example ?
Oh , yes . he suddenly shouted , &quot; What are you doing in the bathroom ? &quot;
and then a little later when I was writing him a prescription ... he suddenly said , &quot; For heaven &apos;s sake , behave yourself . &quot;
how extraordinary . and how is poor Edith ?
she &apos;ll be all right in a few days . it &apos;s only a slight concussion .
how does it feel now ?
all right . is this darn sling really essential ?
I had hoped to drive into Folkestone this evening .
- Be much better if you didn &apos;t . - You could easily wait and go tomorrow .
I can &apos;t stand another of those dreary evenings at home , Charles .
it &apos;ll drive me dotty .
besides , I haven &apos;t seen a movie for seven years .
- Let me be the first to congratulate you . - What &apos;s that , old man ?
Charles , do try to be sensible . I implore you .
sorry . I forgot .
you can drive the car if you go very slowly and carefully .
use your right arm as little as possible .
thank you .
- Good-bye , Mrs. Condomine . - Good-bye .
I &apos;ll pop around and see you again tomorrow morning .
thank you .
- Good-bye .
- Good-bye .
Charles .
- Yes ?
- Where &apos;s Elvira ?
she &apos;s slipped out of the front door with Dr. Bradman .
- Are you sure she &apos;s not here ?
- Yes . quite sure .
- Good . I want to talk to you . - Oh , dear .
you &apos;re not going to start making scenes again , are you ?
this is a fight , Charles .
it &apos;s a duel to the death between Elvira and me .
melodramatic hysteria .
the poor little thing comes back trustingly after all these years in the other world -
Elvira is about as trusting as a puff adder ... and a good deal more dangerous into the bargain .
dangerous ?
she came here with one purpose and one purpose only .
and if you can &apos;t see it , you &apos;re a bigger fool than I thought you .
what purpose could she have beyond the natural desire to see me again ?
after all , you must remember she was extremely attached to me , poor child .
her purpose is perfectly obvious . it &apos;s to get you to herself forever .
- That &apos;s absurd .
how could she ?
- By killing you off , of course .
killing me off ?
you &apos;re mad .
doesn &apos;t it strike you as peculiar that you , Cook , Edith and Webb ... all met with violent accidents on the same day ?
Yes , but why should she want to kill me ?
I could understand her wanting to kill you , but why me ?
if you were dead , it would be her final triumph over me .
she &apos;d have you forever on her beastly astral plane , and I &apos;d be left high and dry .
she &apos;s probably planning some sort of spiritual remarriage .
I wouldn &apos;t put anything past her .
Ruth .
for heaven &apos;s sake , stop looking like a wounded spaniel and concentrate .
this is serious . I &apos;m going to see Madame Arcati .
I don &apos;t care how cross she is . she &apos;s got to help us .
even if she can &apos;t get rid of Elvira ... she must know some technical method of rendering her harmless .
I &apos;ll be back in half an hour . tell Elvira I &apos;ve gone to see the vicar .
- This is appalling . - Never mind about that .
remember now , don &apos;t give yourself away by so much as the flick of an eyelid .
- Look out . - What ?
I - I merely said it was a nice lookout .
what is a nice lookout ?
the-the weather , Elvira .
I find it very difficult to believe that at this particular moment ... you and Ruthie can &apos;t think of anything more interesting to talk about than the weather .
Ah , but the glass has gone down and down and down .
it &apos;s positively macabre .
Charles and I were not discussing the weather , Elvira .
I was trying to persuade him not to drive you into Folkestone this evening .
it would be bad for his arm , and you can easily wait and go tomorrow .
however , as he seems determined to place your wishes before mine in everything ...
I really have nothing further to say .
I &apos;m sure I hope you both enjoy yourselves very much .
are you ready ?
- What for ?
- To go to Folkestone , of course .
I just want a glass of sherry first .
I don &apos;t believe you want to take me at all .
of course I want to take you , but I still think it would be more sensible to wait until tomorrow . it &apos;s a filthy night .
- Oh , how familiar all this is . - In what way familiar ?
all through our married life , I only had to suggest something ... for you immediately to start hedging me off .
I wasn &apos;t hedging you off . I merely said that I thought ...
Oh , all right .
we &apos;ll spend another nice cozy , intimate evening at home ... with Ruth sewing away at that hideous table center ... and snapping at us like a terrier .
Ruth is perfectly aware the table center is hideous .
it happens to be a birthday present for her mother .
if you don &apos;t behave , I shan &apos;t take you into Folkestone ever .
Oh , please , Charles , don &apos;t be elderly and grand with me .
- Please let &apos;s go now . - Not until I &apos;ve had my sherry .
besides , the car won &apos;t be back for half an hour at least .
- What do you mean ?
- Ruth &apos;s taken it .
- She had to go and see the vicar . - What ?
what &apos;s the matter ?
you say that Ruth has taken the car ?
Yes , to go and see the vicar , but she won &apos;t be long .
Oh , Charles . Oh , Charles .
what are you behaving like that for ?
what have you done ?
done ?
I haven &apos;t done anything .
- Elvira , you &apos;re lying . - I &apos;m not lying . what &apos;s there to lie about ?
- What are you in such a state for ?
- I &apos;m not in a state . I don &apos;t know what you mean .
- You &apos;ve done something dreadful . - Don &apos;t look at me like that , Charles .
- I haven &apos;t . I swear I haven &apos;t . - The car .
no , Charles . no .
Ruth was right . you were trying to kill me . you &apos;ve done something to the car .
Oh , oh , oh .
Ruth !
Ruth !
Hello . Yes ?
speaking . Yes ?
the bridge at the bottom of the hill .
Yes , yes . I &apos;ll come at once .
Ruth .
well , of all the filthy low-down tricks .
Ow ! Ruth !
stop it !
get away from me !
leave me alone !
leave me alone !
Oh !
Ruth !
leave me alone !
Oh , Ruth !
I didn &apos;t mean it !
Ow !
come in .
thank you , Edith .
Oh .
Hello .
Oh , hello , Mr. Condomine .
um , I hope you won &apos;t consider this an intrusion , Mr. Condomine ... but I felt a tremendous urge - like a rushing wind - so I hopped on my bike , and here I am .
I reproach myself bitterly , you know . I threw up the sponge .
in a moment of crisis , I threw up the sponge ... instead of throwing down the gauntlet .
Yes , well , whatever you threw , Madame Arcati , I &apos;m afraid there &apos;s nothing whatever to be done .
Oh , but there is . there is .
I found a formula .
it came to me last night , Mr. Condomine . it came to me in a blinding flash .
I &apos;d just finished my Ovaltine and turned out the light ... when I suddenly started up in bed with a loud cry .
&quot; great Scott ! &quot; I said . &quot; I &apos;ve got it ! &quot;
and at 3 : 00 in the morning , with my brain fairly seething ...
I went to work on my crystal for a little .
pluck up your heart , Mr. Condomine . all is not lost .
well , I &apos;m very glad to hear it , but I think we should leave things as they are for the present .
I - I-I - Mr. Condomine ?
if you &apos;ll pardon my bluntness , Mr. Condomine , I think you &apos;re a blithering idiot .
you &apos;re at liberty to think whatever you please .
Oh , well , have it your own way , Mr. Condomine ... but I warn you that it &apos;s no good locking the stable door after the horse is gone .
Hmm !
Charles , I can &apos;t stand this house another minute .
really , Elvira , I &apos;m surprised at you .
I don &apos;t care how surprised you are . I want to go home .
- Now don &apos;t be childish . - I &apos;m not being childish .
Ruth has hardly left my side for a minute .
- Well , is she here now ? - No .
she &apos;s upstairs lying down .
the funeral exhausted her .
this whole thing has been a failure .
a dreary , miserable failure , and , oh , what high hopes I started out with .
you can &apos;t expect much sympathy from me , you know .
I &apos;m perfectly aware that your highest hope was to murder me .
don &apos;t put it like that . it sounds so beastly .
anyway , it was only because I loved you .
the silliest thing I ever did in my whole life was to love you .
you were always unworthy of me .
that remark comes perilously near impertinence , Elvira .
I sat there on the other side day after day just longing for you .
I did . really .
that was why I put myself down for a return visit ... and had to fill in all those forms ... and wait about in drafty passages for hours .
if only you &apos;d died before you met Ruth , everything might have been all right .
she &apos;s absolutely ruined you .
I hadn &apos;t been in the house for a day before I realized that .
your books aren &apos;t a quarter as good as they used to be either .
that &apos;s entirely untrue .
Ruth helped me and encouraged me in my work , which is more than you ever did .
I should think that &apos;s probably what &apos;s wrong with it .
all you thought about was going to parties and enjoying yourself .
well , why shouldn &apos;t I have fun ?
I died young , didn &apos;t I ?
you needn &apos;t have died at all if you hadn &apos;t been idiotic enough ... to go out in that punt with Guy Henderson and get soaked to the skin .
it was not a punt . it was a little launch .
I don &apos;t care if it was a three-masted schooner .
you had no right to go .
you behaved abominably over Guy Henderson . there &apos;s no use pretending you didn &apos;t .
guy adored me .
and anyway , he was very attractive .
you told me distinctly that he didn &apos;t attract you in the least .
well , you &apos;d have gone through the roof if I &apos;d told you that he did .
anyway , you seem to forget why I went .
you seem to forget that you spent the entire evening making sheep &apos;s eyes ... at that overblown harridan in the false pearls .
a woman in Cynthia Cheviot &apos;s position would hardly wear false pearls .
well , they were practically all she was wearing .
Yes , I &apos;m pained to observe that seven years in the echoing vaults of eternity ... have in no way impaired your native vulgarity .
that was the remark of a pompous ass .
I &apos;m sick of these insults . please go away .
there &apos;s nothing I should like to do better .
you &apos;ve got to get hold of that old gal again and set her to work .
I won &apos;t tolerate this another minute .
for heaven &apos;s sake , don &apos;t snivel .
she &apos;s got to get me out of this .
I want to go home .
I quite agree , and the sooner the better .
on looking back on our married years , Elvira ...
I see now with horrid clarity that they were nothing but a mockery .
you invite mockery , Charles .
something to do with your personality , I think - a certain seedy grandeur .
- You never suspected it ... but I laughed at you steadily from the altar to the grave .
all your ridiculous petty jealousies and your fussings and fumings .
you were feckless and irresponsible and morally unstable .
I realized that before we left Budleigh Salterton .
nobody but a monumental bore ... would have thought of having a honeymoon in Budleigh Salterton .
and what is the matter with Budleigh Salterton ?
I was an eager young bride , Charles .
I wanted glamour and music and romance .
what I got was potted palms seven hours of every day on a damn golf course ... and a three-piece orchestra playing Merrie England .
- Pity you didn &apos;t tell me so at the time . - I did , but you wouldn &apos;t listen .
that was why I went out on the moors that day with Captain Bracegirdle .
I was desperate .
you swore to me that you &apos;d gone over to see your aunt in Exmouth .
Mmm , it was the moors .
with Captain Bracegirdle .
with Captain Bracegirdle .
with Captain Brace - I might have known it .
what a fool I was . what a blind fool .
- Did he make love to you ?
- Of course .
- Oh , Elvira . - Only very discreetly .
he was in the cavalry , you know .
all I can say is that I &apos;m well rid of you .
unfortunately , you &apos;re not .
with any luck , I soon will be .
Ah , Mr. Condomine .
well , I can &apos;t say I &apos;m entirely surprised .
I &apos;m afraid I &apos;ve broken your -
do come inside .
Oh , take off your coat . just sling it over the bannisters .
Madame Arcati , I want you to meet my first wife , Elvira .
Oh . Oh , my dear . how do you do ?
no , she &apos;s not there . she &apos;s , uh , in the doorway .
are you happy , my dear ?
tell the silly old bag to mind her own business .
was the journey difficult ?
- Are you weary ?
- Oh , she &apos;s dotty .
this is wonderful . wonderful . I almost have contact .
- I can sense the vibrations . - But , Madame Arcati , she &apos;s gone in there .
how fascinating .
very interesting . I smell ectoplasm strongly .
what a disgusting thing to say .
well , go on , Elvira . don &apos;t be a spoilsport . give her a bit of encouragement .
Oh , all right . not that I approve of these Maskelyne and Devant carryings-on .
Yes , yes . again . again .
- Oh !
- How &apos;s that ?
this is first-rate . it really is first-rate .
absolutely stunning .
I &apos;m so glad you &apos;re pleased .
you darling . you little darling .
Oh , stop her fawning on me , Charles , or I &apos;ll break something .
Madame Arcati , Elvira and I have discussed the whole situation ... and she wishes to go home immediately .
- Home ?
- Well , wherever she came from .
Oh , you don &apos;t think she &apos;d like to stay a few days longer ... while I try to get things a little more organized ?
no , no , no . I want to go now .
you said something about a formula . what is it ?
- Oh , very well . if you insist . - I most emphatically do insist .
- Oh , Charles . - Shut up .
all right . I can &apos;t guarantee anything , you know .
- I &apos;ll do my best , but it may not work . - What is the formula ?
nothing more than a little verse really . it fell into disuse after the 17th century .
Oh , I shall need some pepper and salt .
Ah . Yes .
we ought of course to have some shepherd &apos;s wort and a frog or two ... but I daresay I can manage without .
- Is this enough ?
- Yes , thanks .
now , let me see .
Ah , yes . Sprinkle it , will you ?
just a soupçon .
there , right in the middle .
this is going to be a flop . I can tell you that here and now .
Oh , steady , steady , steady .
and now a few snapdragons out of that vase .
there &apos;s a good chap .
if that Mr. Emsworth of the Psychical Research Society could see me ... he &apos;d have a fit , he would really .
now then , sit down , Mr. Condomine .
and rest your hands on the table , but don &apos;t put your fingers in the pepper .
I shall switch out the lights myself .
Oh , shucks !
I &apos;d almost forgotten .
one triangle ... one half circle ... and one little dot ... there .
Merlin does this sort of thing at parties and bores us all stiff with it .
it &apos;s a waste of time . she &apos;s a complete fake .
anything &apos;s worth trying .
I am as anxious for it to succeed as you are .
don &apos;t make any mistake about that , but I &apos;ll lay you 10-to-1 it &apos;s a dead failure .
now , Mr. Condomine ... if your wife would be kind enough to lie down on the sofa .
go on , Elvira .
this is sheer nonsense . don &apos;t blame me if I get the giggles .
concentrate . think of nothing .
that &apos;s right . quite right .
now , you won &apos;t be frightened , dear , will you ?
it &apos;s absolutely painless .
arms at the sides , legs extended .
breathe steadily .
in , out .
is she comfortable ?
- Are you comfortable , Elvira ? - No .
Yeah , she &apos;s quite comfortable .
I shall join you in a minute , Mr. Condomine .
I may have to go into a slight trance , but , if I do , pay no attention .
hold on to yourself , Mr. Condomine . concentrate .
Oh , dear . it &apos;s the pepper .
Ghostly specter , ghoul or fiend , nevermore be thou convened .
shepherd &apos;s wort and holy rite banish thee into the night .
- What a disagreeable little verse . - Be quiet , Elvira .
is there anyone there ?
is there anyone there ?
one rap for yes . two raps for no .
is there anyone there ?
good stuff !
is that you , Daphne ?
I &apos;m sorry to bother you , dear , but Mrs. Condomine wants to return .
now , then , Daphne .
did you hear what I said ?
can you help us ?
hold on to it , Mr. Condomine . it &apos;s trying to break away .
what on earth &apos;s happening ?
what &apos;s the matter , Madame Arcati ?
Oh , she &apos;s in one of her blasted trances again ... and I &apos;m as much here as ever I was .
are you hurt ?
wake up .
Oh , leave her alone . she &apos;s having a whale of a time .
if I ever do get back , I &apos;ll strangle that ruddy little Daphne .
Oh . what happened ?
- Nothing . nothing at all . - Yes , it did .
- Yes . you fell over . that &apos;s all that happened .
- What , is she still here ?
- Yes , of course . - Something must have gone wrong .
Oh , make her do it again properly , Charles . I &apos;m sick of being messed about like this .
be quiet . she &apos;s doing her best .
something happened . I sensed it in my trance . I felt it .
it shivered through me .
once and for all , Charles . what the devil does this mean ?
well , I can &apos;t think how I can have been such a duffer .
- I only hope you &apos;re on the right track now . - Oh , not a doubt of it , Mr. Condomine .
I think I may confidently promise you that , next time ... we shall be able to kill two birds with one stone .
I can &apos;t feel your simile is entirely fortunate .
mind my crystal , Mr. Condomine .
Ah !
well , now that we &apos;ve returned to the scene of the crime , as it were ... everything will be plain sailing .
are they gone ?
- No . - Oh .
are they gone now ?
no .
are they gone now ?
Hickory rod and birch in bud ... toad in the hole and toad in the mud ... broomstick , bracken and Halloween ... make these furious spirits seem ... nothing more than a ghastly dream .
are they still here ?
Yes .
end of Round 6 .
Oh , well , cheer up , Mr. Condomine .
Rome wasn &apos;t built in a day , you know .
this is definitely one of the most frustrating nights I &apos;ve ever spent .
Hmm . the reply to that is pretty obvious .
I &apos;m sure I don &apos;t know what you mean .
Oh , skip it .
thank you , Mr. Condomine .
Oh , if you &apos;ll excuse me , I &apos;ll just have another of those delicious sandwiches .
I &apos;m as hungry as a hunter .
- Would you like a glass of beer ?
- No , thank you . better not .
now look here , Charles , this has gone far enough .
we &apos;ve stood up , we &apos;ve lain down .
we &apos;ve concentrated , we &apos;ve sat interminably ... while that tiresome old woman recited extremely unflattering verses at us .
we &apos;ve endured five séances .
we &apos;ve watched her fling herself in and out of trances until we &apos;re dizzy .
and at the end of it , we find ourselves exactly where we were at the beginning ... and I &apos;m exhausted .
well , I &apos;m just as ... exhausted as you are .
I &apos;ve been doing all the blasted table tapping .
looks as if Elvira and I will have to stay together indefinitely in this house .
you &apos;re not going to stay indefinitely in this house .
with you then . we shall have to be with you .
Oh , I don &apos;t see why .
why don &apos;t you take a cottage somewhere ?
you called us back .
I &apos;ve already explained till I &apos;m black in the face that I did nothing of the sort .
Madame Arcati says you did .
Madame Arcati is a muddling old fool .
if she can &apos;t get us back , she can &apos;t . that &apos;s that . we must try to think of something else .
she must get you back . anything else is unthinkable .
there &apos;s gratitude for you .
you called us back , and you &apos;ve done nothing but try to get rid of us ever since we came .
- Hasn &apos;t he , Elvira ?
- He certainly has .
and now , owing to your idiotic inefficiency , we find ourselves in this mortifying position .
we &apos;re neither fish , flesh , fowl nor ... whatever it is .
good red herring .
are the girls getting despondent ?
- Yes , I &apos;m afraid they are rather . - Oh . we mustn &apos;t give up hope .
chin up , never give in . that &apos;s my motto .
this schoolgirl phraseology is driving me mad .
now , then .
now , then what ?
what do you say if we have another séance and really put our shoulders to the wheel ?
make it a real rouser .
if we &apos;re not very careful , she &apos;ll materialize a hockey team .
Charles , I implore you not to let her have another séance .
now listen , Madame Arcati , before you go into any further trances ...
I think we should discuss the situation a little .
good . an excellent idea .
well , fire away , Mr. Condomine .
well , my wives and I have been talking it over ... and they &apos;re both still absolutely convinced that I somehow or other called them back .
very natural .
and I &apos;m equally convinced that I did not .
well , neither of them could have appeared unless there had been somebody - some psychic subject - in the house who wished for them .
- Yes , well , it wasn &apos;t me . - Perhaps it was Dr. Bradman .
I never knew he cared .
great Scott !
I believe I &apos;ve been barking up the wrong tree .
- How do you mean ?
- The Sudbury case .
- I don &apos;t understand . - There &apos;s no reason why you should .
it was before your day . I wonder . Oh , I wonder .
what was the Sudbury case ?
I wish you would explain .
it was the case that made me famous , Mr. Condomine .
it was what you might describe in theatrical parlance as my first smash hit .
I had letters from all over the world about it , especially India .
what did you do ?
I dematerialized old Lady Sudbury ... after she &apos;d been firmly entrenched in the private chapel for over 17 years .
- How ?
can you tell me how ?
- Chance . a fluke .
I happened on it by the merest coincidence .
- What fluke ?
what did you do ?
- All in good time . wait .
now , who was present during our first séance ?
only the Bradmans and Ruth and me and yourself .
to be sure . to be sure .
but the Bradmans aren &apos;t here tonight , are they ?
- No . - Quickly . my crystal .
- Here . - Thank you .
Drat the thing , it gives me the pip . it &apos;s cloudy again .
that &apos;s better . it &apos;s there again . it &apos;s there again .
- I &apos;m beginning to understand . - I wish I was .
- What &apos;s there again ?
- It &apos;s a bandage . a white bandage .
hold on to a white bandage .
- I haven &apos;t got a white bandage . - Shh !
she &apos;s too good , you know . she ought to be in a circus .
be you in nook or cranny , answer me .
be you in still room or closet , answer me .
be you behind the panel , above the stairs , beneath the eaves ... waking or sleeping , answer me !
well , that ought to do it or I &apos;m a Dutchman .
- Do what ? - Shh , shh , shh ! wait .
it &apos;s near .
it &apos;s near . it &apos;s very near .
if it &apos;s a ghost , I shall scream .
did you ring , sir ?
bandage . a white bandage .
- No , Edith . - I &apos;m sorry , sir .
I could &apos;ve sworn I heard the bell or somebody calling .
I was asleep . I don &apos;t rightly know which it was .
come here , child .
Oh .
well , go on . go to Madame Arcati .
it &apos;s quite all right .
who do you see in this room , child ?
- Oh , dear . - Answer , please .
- You , Madame . - Go on .
the master .
- Anyone else ?
- Oh , no , Madame .
- Look again . - I don &apos;t understand , sir .
Oh , come child , don &apos;t beat about the bush .
look again .
do you see anyone else now ?
- Oh , no , Madame . - She &apos;s lying .
- Madame . - They always do .
&quot; they &quot; ?
where are they now ?
by the piano .
she can see them .
do you mean to say she can see them ?
probably not very clearly , but enough .
let me go . I haven &apos;t done nothin &apos; nor seen anybody .
let me go back to bed .
get her a sandwich .
I don &apos;t want a sandwich . I want to go back to bed .
- Oh , nonsense . - Here you are , Edith .
a big , healthy girl like you saying no to a delicious sandwich ?
I never heard of such a thing .
- Sit down , dear . - Please , sir , I -
now go on , Edith , do as Madame Arcati says .
if she &apos;s been the cause of all this unpleasantness ...
I shall give her a week &apos;s notice tomorrow .
you may not be here tomorrow .
now look at me , Edith .
cuckoo , cuckoo , cuckoo .
Oh , dear . what &apos;s the matter with her ?
is she barmy ?
here , Edith . this is my finger . look .
have you ever seen such a long , long , long finger before ?
now it &apos;s on the left . now it &apos;s on the right .
backwards and forwards it goes . very quietly . see ?
backwards and forwards .
Tick-tock . Tick-tock .
the mouse ran up the clock .
be quiet . you &apos;ll spoil everything .
Tick-tock .
Tick-tock .
♪ Rumpty-tumty tiddle-lee-um Hi , ditey-oh-toh ♪
- So far , so good . she &apos;s off , all right . - Off ?
she &apos;s a natural , just the same as the Sudbury case .
really , it &apos;s the most amusing coincidence .
now then , if you &apos;d ask your wives to stand close together , please .
- Yes , yes . where ?
- Over there by the window .
right .
Ruth , Elvira .
- I resent being ordered about like this . - I &apos;m afraid I must insist .
I don &apos;t like this .
I don &apos;t like any of it .
I feel peculiar .
it would serve you right if we flatly refused to do anything at all .
are you sorry for having been so mischievous , Edith ?
Oh , yes , Madame .
you know what to do now , don &apos;t you , Edith ?
Oh , yes , Madame .
I believe it &apos;s going to work , whatever it is .
Oh , Charles . this is good-bye , Charles .
make her stop for a minute , Charles . there &apos;s something I want to say before I go .
you should have thought of that before . too late now .
- Well , of all the mean , ungrateful - - Charles , listen a moment .
lights .
I saw Captain Bracegirdle again , Charles . several times .
I went to the Four Hundred with him twice while you were in Nottingham .
and I must say that I couldn &apos;t have enjoyed myself more .
don &apos;t think you &apos;re getting rid of us so easily , my dear .
you may not be able to see us , but we shall be here all right .
I consider you &apos;ve behaved atrociously over the whole miserable business .
they &apos;ve gone .
they &apos;ve really gone .
splendid !
hurrah !
we &apos;ve done it .
that &apos;s quite enough singing for the moment , Edith .
hadn &apos;t you better wake her up ?
she might bring them back again .
wake up , child .
Wh-Where am I ?
it &apos;s all right , Edith . you can go to bed now .
but I was in bed . how did I get down here ?
I rang , Edith . I rang the bell , and you answered it .
did I drop off ?
do you think it &apos;s my concussion ?
now off you go , Edith . thank you very much .
thank you very much indeed .
Oh , sir , whatever for ?
Oh , sir !
well , what on earth did she mean by that ?
golly !
what a night .
I &apos;m ready to drop in my tracks .
I &apos;m deeply grateful to you , Madame Arcati .
I don &apos;t know what arrangements you generally make ... but I trust that you &apos;ll send in your account in due course .
good heavens , Mr. Condomine . it was a pleasure .
I shouldn &apos;t dream of such a thing .
would you like to stay ?
there &apos;s a spare room , you know .
no , thanks . each to his own nest .
I &apos;ll pedal home in a jiffy . it &apos;s only seven miles .
Oh , I &apos;ll collect my tackle later on .
perhaps you &apos;d give me the pleasure of lunching with you one day .
when you come back , I shall be delighted .
come back ?
take my advice , Mr. Condomine , and go away immediately .
but
- What , you don &apos;t mean -
this must be an unhappy house for you , Mr. Condomine .
there must be memories both grave and gay in every corner of it .
- Also - - Also what ?
there are more things in heaven and earth , Mr. Condomine .
just go . pack up your traps and go , as soon as possible .
you don &apos;t mean they might still be here ?
¿ Quién sabe ? as the Spanish say .
Hmm . I think I will take your advice , Madame Arcati . thank you very much .
well , good-bye , Mr. Condomine . it &apos;s been fascinating .
from first to last , fascinating .
Oh , don &apos;t bother to see me out . I can find my way .
Cheerio once more . and good hunting .
Ruth ?
Elvira ?
are you there ?
Yes , I know darn well you are there .
I just want to tell you there &apos;s no use your hanging around any longer ... because I &apos;m going away .
I &apos;m going a long way away .
somewhere where I don &apos;t believe you &apos;ll be able to follow me .
I don &apos;t believe ghosts can travel over water .
is that quite clear , my darlings ?
you said in one of your more acid moments , Ruth ... that I &apos;d been hagridden all my life .
how right you were .
but now I &apos;m free , Ruth dear ... not only of Elvira and Mother and Mrs. Winthrop-Llewellyn ... but free of you too .
and I should like to take this farewell opportunity ... of saying that I &apos;m enjoying it immensely .
Oh . thank you .
you were very silly , Elvira , to think I didn &apos;t know all about you and Captain Bracegirdle .
I did .
and what you didn &apos;t realize was that I was extremely attached to Paula Westlake at the time .
Good-bye for the moment , my dears .
I expect we &apos;re bound to meet again one day , but until we do ...
I &apos;m going to enjoy myself as I &apos;ve never enjoyed myself before .
your attention , please .
announcing the departure of American Airlines westbound Flight 9 .
flight 9 now loading at Gate 3 for immediate departure .

the 19th ?
see , listen , I can &apos;t wait that long . I just got back from oversea .
I wanna get home . I &apos;m sorry . there &apos;s a waiting list .
my secretary made arrangements to have my tickets here .
my name is Gibbons .
George H. Gibbons .
-Yes , they &apos;re right here .
-Thank you . -May we weigh your baggage , please ?
-Yes , excuse me .
-Put them right there , please .
-Sorry .
you might try the ATC , Captain .
ATC , where are they ?
out the terminal to your right and across the field .
thanks .
you have 16 pounds excess baggage , Mr. Gibbons .
Oh , that &apos;s all right .
Right-o , sir .
at ease , men .
flight 93 .
flight 93 . for Denver , San Francisco and Seattle .
that flight has been canceled until further notice .
-Yeah .
-you got anything for Detroit ?
-Nope , how about Cleveland ?
-Cleveland ?
okay .
-Fill this out . -Guess I &apos;m going to Cleveland .
-It &apos;s a nice town .
-Yeah , but Detroit &apos;s where I live .
sarge , what &apos;s the chances of a ride to Boone City ?
you got orders ?
-Sure .
-Okay .
I haven &apos;t got anything now , but fill this out , I &apos;ll call you if anything comes up .
okay , I guess I &apos;ll wait .
guys , I need a couple of men to give me a hand with this out to a plane .
-Okay . -Hey , come on .
let &apos;s go . let &apos;s go , huh ?
I bet this thing weighs a ton .
what &apos;s the matter , sailor ?
tired or something ?
okay , let &apos;s go .
out this way .
fellas , take it easy down the stairs .
-Got it ? -Yeah . there you go .
Hey , look out , fellas .
-Take it easy going down the stairs .
-Oh , my aching back . Derry .
-Derry .
Captain Fred Derry .
-Oh , coming . -Parrish .
Homer Parrish .
-Here .
-you Derry ?
-Yeah .
-Parrish ?
-Right . got a call from Baseops .
there &apos;s a B-17 taking off for Boone City .
you &apos;ll have a long ride . she &apos;s making a lot of stops . you &apos;ll get there tomorrow .
that suit you ?
-Sure , that &apos;s swell . -Okay , sign here .
boy , it sure is great to be going home .
-Here you go , sailor .
-Sign on the dotted--
I &apos;ll do it for you .
what &apos;s the matter ? think I can &apos;t spell my own name ?
no , I just thought that ....
I know , sarge .
Hey , Joe . you better hurry up out there , because she &apos;s taking off soon .
right , thanks .
come on , sailor .
-Where &apos;s your stuff ? -Right here .
excuse us , corporal .
-Boone City your home , sailor ?
-Yes , sir , captain .
forget the rank , chum .
I &apos;m out . -Whereabouts do you live in Boone ?
-Over on West 17th Street .
-you know where Jackson High is ?
-Sure . -Go ahead . -Well , it &apos;s just a couple of blocks past it .
-Hi , sarge .
-My name &apos;s Fred Derry .
-Al Stephenson .
-And this is Homer ....
what is it , Homer ?
-Parrish . -Glad to know you .
-Glad to know you , sarge .
-you from Boone too ? -Yeah , sure I am .
-How long since you &apos;ve been home ?
-a couple of centuries .
come on , we &apos;ll sit in the radio compartment until after the takeoff then we &apos;ll get in the nose and get a nice view of the good old U.S.A .
boy , oh , boy .
Hey , look at that . look at those automobiles down there .
you can see them so plain , you can even see the people .
Yeah , looks like we &apos;re flying by road map .
-Is this your first ride in one of these ?
-Yeah , this is my first plane ride .
I saw plenty of flying , all right .
I was on a CV .
that &apos;s a flattop .
but I never knew things looked so pretty from up here .
sure is beautiful .
I never thought so .
this used to be my office .
-Bombardier , weren &apos;t you ?
-Yeah .
that &apos;s where the bombsight was .
I spent a lot of time on my knees up there .
-Praying ?
-Yeah , that too .
-Cigarette , Homer ?
-Thanks . it &apos;s all right , I can get it .
here , I &apos;ve got a match , captain .
thank you .
-Thank you .
-Anybody superstitious ?
-No , no , go ahead .
boy , you ought to see me open a bottle of beer .
-Well , then you got nothing to worry about .
-Thanks . I guess you saw a lot of action .
no , I didn &apos;t see much of the war .
I mean the way you fellas did .
you trying to kid the Army ?
no , I was stationed in the repair shop below decks .
Oh , I was in plenty of battles .
but I never saw a Jap or heard a shell coming at me .
when we were sunk , all I know is there was a lot of fire and explosions .
and I was ordered topsides and overboard , and I was burned .
when I came to , I was on a cruiser and my hands were off .
after that , I had it easy .
-Easy ?
-That &apos;s what I said .
they took care of me fine .
they trained me to use these things .
I can dial telephones , I can drive a car , I can even put nickels in a jukebox .
I &apos;m all right .
but what , sailor ?
well ....
well , you see , I &apos;ve got a girl .
she knows what happened to you , doesn &apos;t she ?
sure .
they all know .
but they don &apos;t know what these things look like .
-What &apos;s your girl &apos;s name , Homer ?
-Wilma . she and I went to high school together .
-I bet Wilma &apos;s a swell girl .
-She is .
and it &apos;ll be all right , sailor .
you wait and see .
Yeah .
wait and see .
Wilma &apos;s only a kid .
she &apos;s never seen anything like these hooks .
say , wait till I get home and tell the folks about this trip .
I &apos;m the first one in my family that ever rode in an aeroplane .
-Hey , Al .
-Yeah ?
you remember what it felt like when you went overseas ?
as well as I remember my own name .
I feel the same way now .
only more so .
I know what you mean .
just nervous out of the service , I guess .
the thing that scares me most is that everybody &apos;s gonna try to rehabilitate me .
all I want &apos;s a good job , a mild future and a house big enough for me and my wife .
give me that much and I &apos;m rehabilitated like that .
I &apos;d say that &apos;s not too much to ask .
you married , Al ?
-Yep .
-How long ?
Twenty years .
Twenty years ?
holy smoke .
we didn &apos;t even have 20 days before I went over .
I married a girl I met when I was in training in Texas .
well , you and your wife will have a chance to get acquainted .
Yeah .
I wonder how Homer will make out with that girl of his .
Wilma .
I hope Wilma is a swell girl .
-The old hometown hasn &apos;t changed much .
there &apos;s the golf course .
people are playing golf .
just as if nothing had ever happened .
Hey , there &apos;s Jackson High football field .
boy , I sure would like to have a dollar for every forward pass I threw down there .
good old Jackson High .
-Hey , that must be the new airport .
-Yeah , we &apos;re turning into it now .
holy smoke .
I never knew there were so many planes .
and they &apos;re junking them .
-What ?
boy , oh , boy .
what we could have done with those in &apos; 43 .
Yeah , I &apos;ll bet .
some of them look brand new .
from the factory to the scrapheap .
that &apos;s all they &apos;re good for now .
we gotta get out of the nose while he sets her down .
Hey , look there &apos;s the ballpark .
say , how are the Beavers doing this season ?
they &apos;re in sixth place .
still in second division .
-Hey , there &apos;s Butch &apos;s Place .
-Butch &apos;s ?
-Who &apos;s that ? -Gosh , Butch has got himself a neon sign .
-Have you ever been to Butch &apos;s ?
-No . Oh , Butch Engle that runs it , he &apos;s my uncle .
swell guy .
only the family don &apos;t think he &apos;s respectable because he sells liquor .
-That &apos;s the best joint in town .
-we &apos;ll have to get together there . swell .
this is my street .
fifteen , 17 .
it &apos;s the fourth house from here .
I wonder if Wilma &apos;s home .
how about the three of us going back to Butch &apos;s Place ?
we &apos;ll have a couple of drinks and then we can go home .
you &apos;re home now , kid .
-Well , so long .
-So long , Homer .
-Where next ?
-Just a minute , bud .
it &apos;s Homer !
momma ! momma !
Daddy !
it &apos;s Homer ! Homer &apos;s here !
Wilma !
Wilma !
Wilma , come on over !
-My boy .
-Oh , darling .
it &apos;s good to see you .
-Isn &apos;t this wonderful ?
-There &apos;s Wilma .
okay , let &apos;s go .
-Well ....
-No , don &apos;t .
I &apos;ll carry it .
what &apos;s the matter , Ma ?
it &apos;s nothing .
it &apos;s just that your ma &apos;s so glad to see you home .
Yeah , I know .
you gotta hand it to the Navy .
they sure trained that kid how to use those hooks .
they couldn &apos;t train him to put his arms around his girl , to stroke her hair .
-Is it the next turn up here ?
-Yeah , the next turn on the left .
Hey , Fred , why don &apos;t we drop you first ?
no , you &apos;re next .
and we &apos;re not going back to Butch &apos;s for a drink , either .
feel as if I were going in to hit a beach .
some barracks you got here .
Hey , what are you , a retired bootlegger ?
nothing as dignified as that .
how much do I owe you ?
take your hand out of your pocket , sergeant .
you &apos;re outranked .
Yes , sir , captain , sir .
-Good luck , chum .
Yes , I will .
Yes , sir .
one moment , please .
one moment , please .
-Just whom do you wish to see ?
-Mrs . Stephenson .
well , just a minute .
I &apos;ll have to announce you first .
you put that phone down .
I &apos;m her husband .
-you &apos;re Mr. Stephenson ?
-Sergeant Stephenson .
what did you expect ?
a four-star general ?
I &apos;m sorry to have kept you waiting .
-Fourth floor .
-Yes , sir .
I &apos;ll get it , Peg .
where &apos;s Mom ?
who &apos;s that at the door , Peggy ?
Peggy .
rob , who was-- ?
-I look terrible .
-Who says so ?
-It isn &apos;t fair of you to bust in on us like this .
-I phoned you from Portland .
Yes , but you said you wouldn &apos;t be home for--
we were lucky .
we got a plane to Welburn .
I thought we were gonna get stuck there , but we came right through .
-Al , are you all right ?
-Sure .
-Are you all right ?
-Of course I am .
-Let me look at you .
-Don &apos;t look now , I need a bath and a shave .
if you don &apos;t mind , Mom .
Dad .
darling .
I &apos;d better call the Kenworthys and tell them we won &apos;t be over .
-The Kenworthys ?
my son .
and my daughter .
I don &apos;t recognize you .
what &apos;s happened ?
just a few years of normal growth .
don &apos;t you approve ?
I don &apos;t know yet .
I &apos;ve gotta have more time to get to know you .
Hello ?
Oh , Alice , this is Milly .
I &apos;m terribly sorry , but we can &apos;t be over .
I mean , I &apos;m terribly happy .
you see , Al ....
my husband .
Yes .
he &apos;s home .
Yes .
Yes .
-Freddy .
-Hello , Hortense .
well , say .
Pat .
Pat , it &apos;s Freddy .
he &apos;s home again .
Hello , Pop .
gee , I wish we &apos;d known you were coming .
we &apos;d have had the place kind of cleaned up .
well , haven &apos;t you got anything to say to your own son ?
-Glad to see you , my boy .
-Look at him , Pat .
look at your hero son .
and look at all those beautiful ribbons on his chest .
go on , Freddy , tell your father how you got those ribbons and what they mean .
-Where &apos;s Marie ?
-Marie ?
Yeah , she out ?
-Oh , Marie isn &apos;t here , Freddy .
-Will she be back soon ?
well , she &apos;s not living with us anymore , Freddy .
she took an apartment downtown .
why didn &apos;t anybody write me about it ?
well , we were afraid it might worry you , you being so far away .
and it was inconvenient for Marie living in this place after she took that job .
but we forwarded all your letters and the allotment checks .
she took a job ?
where ?
some nightclub .
I don &apos;t know just which one .
Oh , the poor girl works till all hours .
where does she live ?
Grandview Arms on Pine Street .
but there &apos;s nothing to worry about , Freddy .
Marie &apos;s fine .
we saw her last Christmas .
she brought us some beautiful presents .
Marie &apos;s a good-hearted girl .
you know what time she goes out to work ?
well , about suppertime , I imagine .
do you mind if I leave my stuff here ?
I &apos;ll pick it up later .
sure , but aren &apos;t you gonna stay and have a bite to eat ?
no , thank you , Hortense .
well ....
so long , Pop .
I &apos;ll be back .
well , it &apos;s ....
I &apos;m glad to have you home , my boy .
it &apos;s good to be home , Pop .
here , a cap .
here &apos;s a samurai sword , Rob .
thanks very much , Dad .
and here &apos;s a flag I found on a dead Jap soldier .
all that writing on it are signatures and good luck messages from his relatives .
Yes , I know .
the Japanese attach a lot of importance to their family relationship .
Yeah .
Yeah , entirely different from us .
say , you were at Hiroshima , weren &apos;t you , Dad ?
did you happen to notice any of the effects of radioactivity on the people who survived the blast ?
no , I didn &apos;t . should I have ?
well , we &apos;ve been having lectures in atomic energy at school .
and Mr. McLaglen , he &apos;s our physics teacher he says that we &apos;ve reached the point where the whole human race has either got to find a way to live together ...
- ... or else .... -Or else .
that &apos;s right .
or else .
because when you combine atomic energy with jet propulsion and radar and guided missiles , well , just think of the ....
Oh , you &apos;re just kidding me , Dad .
you &apos;ve been to all these places and you &apos;ve seen everything .
I &apos;ve seen nothing .
I should have stayed home and found out what was really going on .
I finished the dishes .
why do you have to do that ?
is this the maid &apos;s night out ?
our maid took a night out three years ago , we haven &apos;t seen her since .
but everything &apos;s all right because I took a course in domestic science . -Even bought a cook book .
-What &apos;s happened ?
all this atomic energy and scientific efficiency .
it was the war .
you heard about that .
Yeah .
all those problems on the home front .
we used to read about them in Stars and Stripes .
we felt awfully sorry for the civilians .
you don &apos;t have to worry about us , Dad .
we can handle the problems . we &apos;re tough .
rob , haven &apos;t you any homework ?
Oh , sure . good night , Dad .
don &apos;t see why you have to go now .
rob , aren &apos;t you going to take the souvenirs father brought you ?
Oh , yes .
gee , thanks an awful lot , Dad , for these things .
good night .
see you in the morning .
good night , Rob .
-Good night , Mom .
-Good night , darling .
nice to have you around , Dad .
you &apos;ll get us back to normal .
or maybe go nuts myself .
what do you think of the children ?
the children ?
I don &apos;t recognize them .
they &apos;ve grown so old .
I tried to stop them to keep them just as they were when you left , but they got away from me .
-I guess Peggy has a lot of boyfriends .
-She &apos;s very popular .
is she concentrating on anyone particular ?
she hasn &apos;t told me of anyone .
but you &apos;ve told her all the things she ought to know ?
what , for instance ?
well , have you ?
she &apos;s worked two years in a hospital .
she knows more than you or I ever will .
cigarette ?
-Have you forgotten , Al ?
I don &apos;t smoke .
-Sorry .
it &apos;s all right , darling .
-It &apos;s frightening .
-What is ?
youth .
didn &apos;t you run across any young people in the Army ?
-No , they were all old men like me .
-Yes .
it &apos;s terrible to be old , isn &apos;t it ?
-Why don &apos;t you sit down and relax ?
-I &apos;m perfectly relaxed standing up .
is there such a thing as a drink in this house ?
I &apos;ll see .
we haven &apos;t got enough bacon for Dad &apos;s breakfast .
I &apos;ll go out first thing in the morning and get some .
is this all the liquor we have left ?
gosh , I &apos;m afraid so .
I wish he &apos;d given us some warning he was going to get here today .
don &apos;t worry , Mom .
I mean so that we could have gotten in some supplies of things .
mother .
I know it &apos;s a little difficult but that &apos;s only because Dad &apos;s so crazy about you .
he &apos;s been away so long and missed you so terribly .
he can &apos;t just walk in and immediately pick up the old life as if--
Hey , I got a wonderful idea .
let &apos;s go out on the town , the three of us .
-Tonight ?
-Yes , tonight . right now .
we &apos;ll celebrate the old man &apos;s homecoming .
-Not me .
I &apos;m going to bed . -No .
you too .
the three of us .
I wanna do something , see something .
and I &apos;ve been in jungles and around savages so long I gotta find out I &apos;m back in civilization again .
Hey , Rupert , how about another one here ?
well , I &apos;ll tell you as I see it , we &apos;re headed for bad times in this country .
of course , we &apos;re in the backwash of the war boom now but the tide is running out fast .
next year , in my opinion , we &apos;ll see widespread depression and unemployment .
Oh , have a cigar ?
no , thanks .
I &apos;ve got my pipe .
Homer ?
didn &apos;t you contract the tobacco habit in the Navy ?
just cigarettes , Mr. Cameron . thanks .
Wilma tells us you were in the Philippines , Homer .
well , I was around there , Mrs. Cameron , but I never saw anything .
-Did you meet General MacArthur ?
-No , I didn &apos;t get to meet him .
I &apos;ve got a light , Mr. Cameron .
no , that &apos;s all right .
got it .
-Luella .
-Yes , Dad ?
you know , I &apos;ve always thought he &apos;s such a handsome man .
-Who ?
-General MacArthur .
-May I help you with that , Mrs. Parrish ?
-No , Wilma , you sit right down .
-Lemonade , Mrs. Cameron ? -Thank you very much .
have you thought anything about getting a job , Homer ?
-Well , I ....
-Oh , Father it &apos;s much too soon for Homer to be thinking about a job .
he &apos;s just out of the hospital .
Yes , I know but a few months from now , the same opportunities won &apos;t exist that exist today .
you might think about my business , Homer . insurance .
we &apos;ve taken on a number of veterans .
they make good salesmen , you know . men who have suffered from some kind of disability .
come down to the office one of these days , we &apos;ll talk it over . I &apos;m sorry , Mom .
that &apos;s quite all right , Homer .
it won &apos;t hurt the carpet a bit .
Luella , you skin out to the kitchen and get me a dishrag .
there &apos;s another one for you , Homer .
Wilma will hold it for you .
no , thanks .
if you don &apos;t mind , I think I &apos;ll go out and walk around a bit .
where &apos;s Homer ?
he went out .
pick Up Cafe .
there it is , driver . stop right here .
listen , Al , all kidding aside .
don &apos;t you think it &apos;s time to get some sleep ?
absolutely .
sleep .
but first we &apos;ve gotta stop and have one last little drink . and that &apos;s all you are gonna get .
no arguments .
one drink .
it &apos;s good to see you , kid .
your friend told me you were home , but I didn &apos;t expect you--
Hi , captain !
Hey , Homer , my old shipmate . how are you kid ?
sit down .
so you took my advice ? -Yeah .
-Come on , let &apos;s have a drink .
-Hello , Homer .
-Hi , Steve .
boy , am I happy to see you back home again .
go ahead , shake , pal . it won &apos;t bite you .
-What &apos;ll you have ?
-What &apos;ll I have ?
how many times have I dreamed of hearing that question ?
before I went in the Navy , Butch would never let me drink any liquor .
he used to read me lectures on the curse of drink .
but it &apos;s different now .
I &apos;m a veteran .
give me a whiskey , Steve . straight .
how about it , Butch ?
draw a beer for the Navy .
-Butch , I ordered whiskey .
-Beer .
beer .
I &apos;m gonna take my trade to some other joint where I don &apos;t have relatives .
say , what are you doing here , anyway ?
why aren &apos;t you home with the folks ?
well , they went to bed and I wasn &apos;t sleepy so I thought , &quot; Why not come down and see Butch ? &quot;
glad you did , Homer .
well , here &apos;s to you , Butch .
how am I doing ?
-Kid , you &apos;re doing great .
-Thanks .
say , Fred , where did you leave Al ? Oh , Al .
he &apos;s home in the swankiest apartment house in town .
we &apos;ll never see him again .
-Say , this is the best place we &apos;ve been yet .
-Hey , that &apos;s Al .
where you been ?
we were just talking about you .
Oh , my aching back . Hey , Milly .
Peggy .
step up and meet the gang .
this is Homer , this is Fred .
this is my wife and daughter .
Homer and I were together at the Battle of Lingayen Gulf , only we didn &apos;t know it .
-Hi , bub . -How do you do ?
-Al , this is my Uncle Butch .
-Bu--
Oh , I hear you got a new neon sign , huh ?
good for you .
now the party can really get started . Oh , this better .
let &apos;s sit .
Milly , come on .
here &apos;s a good booth .
Fred , come on , sit down .
Hey , Fred , where &apos;s your wife ?
I wanna meet her .
I haven &apos;t been able to find her . she works in some nightclub .
I &apos;ve been around places looking--
well , we &apos;ll find her , Fred , before this night is out .
we &apos;ll deploy our forces and comb the town . won &apos;t we , Milly ?
Oh , by all means .
well , we got the Navy to convoy us .
we gotta get one thing straight .
Homer lost his hands .
he &apos;s got those hooks .
they don &apos;t worry him so they don &apos;t need to worry anybody . right ? -Right .
-Right , now let &apos;s get seriously to work .
-Telephone , Butch .
-Thank you .
give them anything they want .
any kind of beer .
-What &apos;ll it be ?
-How are you , Angus ?
-Hi , sergeant .
Hello . -Nice to see you .
-Looking well .
a little gray .
-Hi , Angus . Yeah , yeah .
well ...
- ... cheers , cheers .
-Cheers !
Homer .
okay , Butch .
aren &apos;t you drinking ?
-Excuse me , folks . -Sure , Homer .
gee , Butch , it &apos;s swell to hear you playing again .
how about &quot; Lazy River &quot; ? remember that ?
sit down , Homer .
Wilma phoned . Wilma ?
-What did she want ?
-you .
Oh , why can &apos;t they leave a guy alone ?
because they &apos;re fond of you , that &apos;s why .
what made you leave the house and get them all worried ?
Oh , they ....
-They got me nervous .
-How ?
Butch , it &apos;s nothing .
I don &apos;t wanna talk about it .
how &apos;d they get you nervous ?
well , they ....
well , they keep staring at these hooks or else they keep staring away from them .
you mean whatever they do is wrong .
why don &apos;t they understand that all I want is to be treated like everybody else ?
take Pop for instance .
he was cleaning his pipe like I &apos;ve seen him do a million times .
and all of a sudden he got conscious that he had hands and I didn &apos;t and he ....
he stopped cleaning his pipe and he tried to hide his hands like he was guilty or something .
give them time , kid .
they &apos;ll catch on .
you know , your folks will get used to you and you &apos;ll get used to them .
then everything will settle down nicely .
unless we have another war .
then none of us have to worry , because we &apos;ll all be blown to bits the first day .
so cheer up , huh ?
Hey , Butch .
you know &quot; Among My Souvenirs , &quot; huh ?
shall we dance ?
well , that &apos;s a charming idea .
do you remember this tune ?
nice to see the young folks enjoying themselves , isn &apos;t it ?
so you &apos;re Al &apos;s daughter . Yes .
I &apos;ve been that as long as I can remember .
you don &apos;t seem like Al &apos;s daughter .
actually , I &apos;m not .
he &apos;s my son by a previous marriage .
-What did you say your name was ? -Peggy .
-Peggy , my name &apos;s Fred .
how do you do ?
-How do you do ?
Oh , no , you don-
- Oh , no .
you &apos;re a bewitching little creature .
in a way , you remind me of my wife .
-But you never told me you &apos;re married . -Oh , yeah .
I &apos;ve got a little woman and two kiddies back there in the States .
-But let &apos;s not think of them now .
-Oh , you &apos;re so right .
this night belongs only to us .
that &apos;s the type of thing people ought to be thinking about these days .
all right , I promise I &apos;ll get right to work on it .
and there &apos;s one thing I &apos;ve been wanting to ask you .
you ask it , Peggy .
you mustn &apos;t feel shy with me .
why don &apos;t you call your wife ?
I don &apos;t know her number .
-I couldn &apos;t find it in the phone book .
-Phone book !
we don &apos;t need to do any telephoning .
we &apos;re all set .
what you need is a drink . good night , everybody .
I &apos;m going home .
-Why ? -I &apos;ve gotta .
Butch says I &apos;ve gotta .
-He &apos;s gonna drive me .
-Oh , no , no .
-But you can &apos;t . no , you can &apos;t ....
-It &apos;s quite all right .
and don &apos;t any of you leave .
I &apos;ll be back .
-Good night , everybody .
-Good night . poor kid .
imagine , he &apos;s gotta go home .
-Doesn &apos;t that put any ideas in your head ?
-Yes .
I &apos;d love to .
lights out , Steve .
-Where do we go next , old pal , old pal ?
-Just follow me , old pal .
step . -Good night , Al .
-Good night , Butch .
been a nice party .
this it , Fred ?
it looks like it .
silly . good night , Milly .
many thanks for a most enjoyable evening .
-Good night , Fred . -Good night , Al .
best of luck to you .
I &apos;ll give him your message . Hey , you do that .
and good night to you , Peggy .
-It has indeed been a great pleasure . -Yes , Fred .
see you soon .
by all means .
I beg your pardon .
good night .
we &apos;d better wait and see if he gets in .
I don &apos;t think he even knows if this is the right place .
come on .
up .
where are we all going now ? don &apos;t ask .
we want it to be a surprise .
they make a lovely couple , don &apos;t they ? Yeah .
I think they &apos;ll be very happy together .
who are you ?
don &apos;t you remember ?
I &apos;m Peggy .
Yes .
Peggy .
I &apos;m not that Peggy .
that &apos;s too bad .
as I remember , when you lie flat on your back , you snore .
where &apos;s your hand ?
give me your hand .
-Is Fred all right ? -Yes .
he &apos;s all right .
-you &apos;ll be comfortable here .
-Sure , Mom . night .
night , dear .
night .
night .
got a turnaround at 4 o &apos;clock .
it &apos;s all over .
you got him .
he &apos;s hit .
she &apos;s on fire .
she &apos;s on fire .
the fire &apos;s spreading .
it &apos;s Gadorsky .
there goes number four .
she &apos;s breaking formation .
watch out for fighters . it &apos;s spread to the wing .
the wing &apos;s on fire .
she &apos;s out of control .
she &apos;s out of control .
she &apos;s going down .
Hey , you guys , jump ! get out of there .
bail out !
Gadorsky .
Gadorsky , get out of that plane !
two chutes open . three .
come on , the rest of you guys .
-Fred .
-Come on , get out !
-Fred , wake up .
wake up . -Gadorsky !
-Gadorsky !
she &apos;s burning up !
-Wake up !
-Get out !
get out !
-Fred !
Fred , wake up ! wake up !
she &apos;s burning up !
she &apos;s gonna hit .
look out !
it &apos;s all right , Fred .
go back to sleep .
go back to sleep .
go back to sleep , Fred .
there &apos;s nothing to be afraid of .
all you have to do is go to sleep and rest .
go to sleep .
go to sleep , Fred .
go to sleep and rest .
go to sleep . go to sleep .
all you have to do is rest .
go to sleep .
Oh , I &apos;m terribly sorry I woke you up .
that &apos;s all right but ....
I know .
you &apos;re about to say , &quot; Where am I ? &quot;
I &apos;ll tell you later , Fred .
you can sleep as long as you want .
-Did he fly 17s or 24s ?
-I don &apos;t know .
-What group was he with ?
-He didn &apos;t say .
well , what did you two talk about ?
rob , you &apos;d better hurry up .
you &apos;ll be late for school .
holy Moses .
I &apos;ll see you later .
Oh , excuse me , captain .
I &apos;m Rob Stephenson , Peggy &apos;s brother .
she &apos;s in there in the kitchen . she &apos;s fixing your breakfast .
I &apos;ve gotta run . Goodbye .
-Hello .
-Hello .
sit down .
-Here , this may help .
-Thanks .
sit down .
you &apos;re Peggy , aren &apos;t you ?
for the last time , yes .
want some eggs ?
-you think I can take them ?
-Sure , they &apos;ll be good for you .
-Like them scrambled ?
-Any way you cook them .
good .
sleep all right ?
wonderful .
that &apos;s good .
-Can I help you with any of that business ?
-you can pour the coffee if you want some .
do you mind if I ask you a somewhat personal question ?
no .
-Where did you sleep last night ?
-On the couch . -That &apos;s terrible .
-What &apos;s terrible ?
I should &apos;ve had enough sense to go to a hotel and not come around here bothering you .
you didn &apos;t bother anybody , Fred .
we &apos;re very glad to have you here .
besides , you couldn &apos;t have gotten a room in a hotel .
did I get out of line with you ?
no .
not really .
-That &apos;s good .
because , you see , I &apos;m married .
-Yes , I know .
I must have got pretty plastered last night .
you had nothing on my dad .
your dad ? who &apos;s he ?
don &apos;t you remember Al ?
Oh , Al .
Yeah , good old Al .
where is he ?
still asleep , I guess .
so you &apos;re Al &apos;s daughter .
you &apos;ve got it all straight now .
-I feel a lot better .
-That &apos;s good .
-Are you married , Peggy ?
-No .
I guess you &apos;ve hardly had time .
-you must have been engaged , though .
-No . why not ?
what &apos;s the matter with the guys around here ?
I guess the best of them are already married .
-Good morning , Fred .
-Good morning , Mrs ....
-Milly &apos;s the name .
-Thanks , Milly .
when Al wakes up , tell him how much I appreciate--
you &apos;re not going .
you haven &apos;t even finished your breakfast .
I &apos;m afraid I haven &apos;t got much of an appetite this morning .
besides , I &apos;ve gotta get downtown .
maybe now I can get into that apartment house where my wife lives .
I &apos;ll drive you , Fred .
I &apos;ve got to get to work at the hospital . just be a minute .
I must &apos;ve acted pretty disgracefully last night .
no .
you just fell in with bad company at Butch &apos;s and got stinking .
you see , the whole trouble was I couldn &apos;t find Marie , that &apos;s my wife .
-I didn &apos;t know she had a job in a nightclub .
-Could &apos;ve happened to anyone .
if Al had come home a little later last night , we wouldn &apos;t have been in .
he wouldn &apos;t have known where to look for us .
-How is Al ?
-we don &apos;t know yet .
ready , Fred .
when he wakes up , you can tell him for me , I think he &apos;s a pretty lucky guy .
thank you , Fred .
-Goodbye , Milly , Thanks for everything .
-Goodbye .
-Bye , Mom .
-What &apos;d you do before the war , Fred ?
-I was a fountain attendant .
-a what ?
-Soda jerk .
-Surprised ?
-Yes , a little .
I bet you mixed up a fine ice cream soda .
you &apos;re darn right .
I was an expert behind that fountain .
I used to toss a scoop of ice cream in the air adjust for wind drift , velocity , altitude , and , wham , in the cone every time .
I figure that &apos;s where I really learned to drop bombs .
what do you think you &apos;ll do now ?
I &apos;m not going back to that drugstore .
somehow or other , I can &apos;t figure myself getting excited about a root beer float .
I don &apos;t know just what I will do but I &apos;m gonna take plenty of time looking around .
I guess after all the places you &apos;ve been , Boone City looks pretty dreary to you .
not from where I &apos;m sitting right now .
that &apos;s not just a line .
I really meant it .
-Who &apos;s that ?
-I brought your breakfast .
-Thanks . -Didn &apos;t think you &apos;d be up for hours .
-you know , I had a dream .
I dreamt I was home .
I &apos;ve had that same dream hundreds of times before .
this time I wanted to find out if it &apos;s really true .
-Am I really home ?
-Looks like it .
and you &apos;re going to be royally treated .
you &apos;re having breakfast in bed .
I seem to have a vague recollection that we had a couple of children .
-Is that right ?
-That &apos;s right . what ever became of them ?
rob &apos;s gone to school and Peggy &apos;s driving downtown with Fred .
Fred ?
Oh , yeah , Fred .
he &apos;s a great guy .
all right ?
there &apos;s your breakfast .
well , it was nice knowing you , Peggy .
-That sounds like a permanent goodbye .
-you never know .
you and your wife must come up to dinner .
that &apos;d be fine .
Oh , there &apos;s one thing more .
about that dream I had last night .
I &apos;ve had it before .
I &apos;m sorry I had to bother you with it .
but you were very kind and you didn &apos;t even mention it this morning .
as a matter of fact , you &apos;ve been swell about everything .
I think they ought to put you in mass production .
-Goodbye , Fred .
-Maybe I &apos;d better wait and see if you get in .
-Maybe that &apos;s a good idea .
Bye .
all right .
say , what &apos;s the big i-- ?
-Freddy !
Freddy , darling , why didn &apos;t you let me know ?
you didn &apos;t give me a chance to fix my face .
-you look all right , babe . -Oh , Freddy , darling . I &apos;m so excited .
I can &apos;t believe it &apos;s you .
come on in , honey , where I can look at you .
Oh , you &apos;re marvelous .
all those ribbons !
you gotta tell me what they all mean .
let me look at you .
but how did you know I was here ?
when I got in yesterday , I went over to Pop &apos;s--
-Yesterday ?
why didn &apos;t-- ?
-I came here , but it was too late .
you &apos;d already gone to work .
I went from one nightclub to another .
-you were looking for me ?
-I was looking for my wife . you &apos;ve found her now .
I wonder how Fred &apos;s getting along .
Fred looks to me as if he &apos;s able to take care of himself .
I &apos;m not so sure about that . it isn &apos;t easy for those Air Force glamour boys when they get grounded .
now , when you &apos;ve been in the infantry , any change is bound to be an improvement .
please stop fussing around and sit down and talk to me .
all right , sergeant .
gosh , you &apos;ve got tough .
-Is this all the cream there is ?
-That &apos;s all .
fine situation when a man can &apos;t get enough to eat in his own home .
look at my pants .
-What about them ?
-Too big . gives you an idea of what the war did to my waistline .
-you holding your stomach in ?
-No , it &apos;s disappeared .
I &apos;ll have to take my clothes to Wyndham and Briggs , get them altered .
I wouldn &apos;t be in too much of a hurry about that .
a couple of weeks of heavy eating and those pants will fit perfectly .
don &apos;t answer it .
Hello .
Oh , yes .
he &apos;s here .
for me ? if it &apos;s the War Department , I &apos;m out .
it &apos;s Mr. Milton .
-Who ? -Mr . Milton .
at the bank .
he &apos;ll be right on .
Hello ?
Oh , yes , Mr. Milton .
Yeah , it sounds good to hear yours .
Yes .
Yes , indeed , Mr. Milton .
Yeah . well , not too bad , no .
Yes .
why , of course .
it &apos;s very kind of you to say that .
Yes .
well , I &apos;ll certainly drop in .
Oh , she &apos;s fine , thank you .
-Yes , they &apos;re fine too .
Well-
- I-
- That &apos;s--
thank you , Mr. Milton .
Yes , good .
Good--
good-
- Goodbye .
Mr. Milton .
he &apos;s called up every day to see if you &apos;d got home .
I guess they want you back at the bank .
he wants me to drop in and talk about it .
you &apos;re not going to work right away .
you ought to rest a while , take a vacation .
I &apos;ve got to make money .
last year it was kill Japs , and this year it &apos;s make money .
we &apos;re all right for the time being .
why do they bother me like that the first day I get home ?
why can &apos;t they give a fellow time to get used to his own family ?
why don &apos;t you come over here and sit down ?
-Chair &apos;s liable to break .
-we can &apos;t be worrying about chairs .
not when they want me back in a nice fat job at a nice fat bank .
-you don &apos;t seem very happy about it .
-I &apos;m not . -Why not , darling ?
-I can &apos;t help thinking about the other guys .
all the ones who haven &apos;t got you .
-you &apos;re crazy .
-No . too sane for my own good .
-Yes , sir ?
-Didn &apos;t this used to be Bullard &apos;s Drugstore ?
Yes , but it was taken over last year by the Midway chain .
but old Mr. Bullard &apos;s still here , in charge of prescription .
-He &apos;s right over there by the phone .
-Thanks .
Yes , sir ?
-Oh , Fred Derry .
-Hello , Mr. Bullard . -Oh , it &apos;s good to see you again .
-How are you ?
it &apos;s good to see you . -Say , what happened here ?
-Well , I sold out .
the Midway people had been after this location for a long time .
-Didn &apos;t he used to work here ?
-Yes , he did . I &apos;ll bet he &apos;s back looking for a job .
and he &apos;ll get it too , with all those ribbons on his chest .
well , nobody &apos;s job is safe with all these servicemen crowding in .
I &apos;d like to have you meet our new manager , Mr. Thorpe .
Oh , no , I don &apos;t think so . I just dropped in to say hello to you .
-I don &apos;t want that old job back .
-Yes , I know . but Midway &apos;s a big , big outfit .
you never can tell .
-Thank you , Mr. Bullard .
-I &apos;ll see you later . I can see that you had a splendid war record , Derry .
just average , Mr. Thorpe .
you &apos;ll understand that since this business changed hands we &apos;re under no obligation to give you your old job back .
I wasn &apos;t thinking of my old job .
I &apos;m looking for a better one . what are your qualifications ?
your experience ?
two years behind a soda fountain and three years behind a Norden bombsight .
Yeah . while in the Army , did you have any experience in procurement ?
-No .
-Purchasing of supplies , materials ? I didn &apos;t do any of that .
I just dropped bombs .
-Did you do any personnel work ?
-No .
but , as an officer , you surely had to act in an executive capacity you had to command men , be responsible for their morale ?
no , I was only responsible for getting the bombs on the target .
I didn &apos;t command anybody . I see . I &apos;m sure that work required great skill .
but , unfortunately , we &apos;ve no opportunities ...
- ... for that with Midway Drugs .
-Yeah . however , we might be able to provide an opening for you as an assistant to Mr. Merkel , the floor manager .
-Sticky Merkel ?
-Clarence Merkel .
Yeah , that &apos;s the fella . he used to be my assistant at the soda fountain .
he &apos;s a very good man .
Incidentally , your work would require part-time duties at the soda fountain .
-At what salary ?
-Thirty-two fifty per week .
Thirty-two fifty . I used to make over $ 400 a month in the Air Force .
-The war is over , Derry .
-Is over . Yeah , well , I think I &apos;ll look around , Mr. Thorpe .
thank you , very much .
-I gotta run .
I &apos;ll drop back later .
-All right .
-Bye .
-Bye . excuse me , girls .
no , conditions are none too good right now , Al .
considerable uncertainty in the business picture .
strikes , taxes still ruinous .
-you like that cigar ?
-Oh , yes , Mr. Milton .
it &apos;s fine . hard to get those during the war , but they &apos;re coming in regularly from Havana .
all things will readjust themselves in time .
we want you back here with us , Al .
well , that &apos;s very nice of you , Mr. Milton but I noticed Steese sitting at my old desk .
-I wouldn &apos;t wanna push him out .
-Steese will stay right there . you &apos;re moving up .
what would you say to being vice president in charge of small loans at a salary of $ 12,000 a year ?
what would you say to that , huh ?
-I &apos;d say it can &apos;t be true .
-Job &apos;s there , Al . you &apos;re the man for it .
what makes you think I am , Mr. Milton ?
well , your war experience would prove invaluable to us here .
see , we have many new problems .
this GI Bill of Rights , for instance .
it involves us in consideration of all kinds of loans to ex-servicemen .
we need a man who understands the soldiers &apos; problems and at the same time who &apos;s well-grounded in the fundamental principles of sound banking .
in other words , you .
well ?
what do you say , Al ?
-I &apos;m overwhelmed .
-Of course .
of course . will you bring them in now , Mrs. Garrett ?
Yes , sir .
-I &apos;d thought of taking it easy for a while .
-Naturally , my boy . after what you &apos;ve been through , you need a vacation .
thank you .
thank you . you &apos;re entitled to enjoy life for a change before you come back to work .
very kind of you to say that , Mr. Milton .
while you &apos;re resting , let &apos;s just ....
when you get a chance . this contains reports with all the figures on our small loans . it &apos;ll give you the whole picture .
you can look them over . just in your spare time , of course .
-Oh , briefcase is a slight gift from the bank .
-Well , thank you .
-Thank you very much , Mr. Milton . -Glad to have you back , Al .
thank you , sir .
well , of course , sweetheart .
I knew you &apos;d be heartbroken . but listen , you can get another blond .
what about Sylvia Mack ?
Oh , you &apos;re crazy .
I think her legs are cute .
well , I &apos;m sorry too , but he doesn &apos;t want me to work nights .
he says it &apos;s inconvenient .
Oh , he &apos;s wonderful .
and how . snappy uniform , a whole ribbon counter on his chest .
sure , I &apos;ll bring him in sometime .
the doorbell &apos;s ringing .
I guess that &apos;s Freddy .
Yeah , yeah . Bye .
Hey , Marie , have you got an extra key ?
I &apos;d like to have it .
-What are you looking at ?
-Holy smoke , honey . that &apos;s the first time I &apos;ve ever seen you in civilian clothes .
well , from now on , honey , you &apos;re not gonna see me in anything else .
I just got it out of the mothballs over at Pop &apos;s house .
I called up the Blue Devil .
-Who ?
-That &apos;s the night club where I worked .
-I told them I &apos;m through .
-Oh , swell . but let &apos;s go there for dinner , Freddy .
I &apos;d like to introduce you to the gang .
-They &apos;ve heard me talk so much about you . -Anything you say .
here &apos;s some perfume and some other junk I bought in Paris .
Fleurette No. 5 .
and this scarf &apos;s cute .
to think of having things from Paris . Freddy , honey , you &apos;re just a big hunk of heaven .
-What &apos;s that a picture of ?
well , that &apos;s my B-17 .
what are those ?
little black flowers that grow in the sky .
Hey , that &apos;s me !
Yeah , I had this picture pasted on the plexiglass over my bombsight .
-It took a lot of trips over Germany , baby .
-That &apos;s sweet . the guys used to kid me about it .
they &apos;d take a look at the picture and ask , &quot; Who &apos;s the dame ? &quot;
and when I told them it was my wife they &apos;d say : &quot; go on , nobody &apos;s got a wife looks like that .
what &apos;s her telephone number ? &quot;
when we go out tonight , will you wear your uniform ?
-Oh , no .
-For my sake . -I &apos;m sorry , baby .
-I &apos;d be so proud to be out with you .
won &apos;t you , please ? well , seeing as it &apos;s you .
seeing as I can &apos;t find any place to hang it up , all right .
but it &apos;s the last time . from now on , if you don &apos;t like me in civilian clothes ...
- ... we &apos;ll just have to stay here all the time .
seriously , honey , you gotta get yourself some new clothes .
that suit &apos;s awful . I know , it &apos;s terrible .
but they tell me you can &apos;t buy anything new now .
I know a place where you can get snappy suits made to order .
you mean there &apos;s a black market ?
you can get a lot of things , if you know the right people .
and if you don &apos;t care how much you spend .
we &apos;re not worrying about that , baby .
I got money . cash money .
nearly a thousand bucks right from the good old U.S. Treasury .
Oh , now you look wonderful .
you look like yourself .
you know , honey , it &apos;s so wonderful , I can hardly believe it .
now we can have a real honeymoon without a care in the world .
just as if nothing had ever happened .
just as if you &apos;d never gone away .
-we &apos;re right back where we started .
-Don &apos;t say that , Marie .
-Don &apos;t say what ? -That we &apos;re right back where we started .
we can never be back there again .
we never wanna be back there .
but why not ? what is it ? what &apos;s the matter with you , Fred ?
Oh , never mind .
skip it . I was back to the drugstore where I used work and I just got suddenly reminded .
come on , let &apos;s go out and have fun .
-Hello , Wilma .
-Good afternoon , Mr. Parrish .
-Have you seen Homer ? -He &apos;s out in the woodshed .
says he wants to get in some practice shooting .
so he can go hunting .
thought that he &apos;d seen enough shooting in the war .
well , I guess he just wants to find something to occupy himself .
I guess so .
I wish there was something I knew to do for him .
his mother and I have tried to make him feel at home .
what are you kids doing ?
Oh , nothing , we &apos;re just playing .
they &apos;re engaged .
-Oh , hello , Wilma .
-Hello .
-Looking for something ?
-No . go right ahead .
-How &apos;d you do , Homer ? -Only fair .
well , you did fine .
I &apos;ll do better .
I &apos;ve been wanting to have a chance to talk to you . -What about ?
-About everything .
about us .
what about us ?
-we &apos;re all right , aren &apos;t we ?
-Listen to me , Homer .
-I &apos;m listening .
you wrote me that when you got home you and I were going to be married . if you wrote that once , you wrote it a hundred times .
isn &apos;t that true ?
Yes , but things are different now .
have you changed your mind ? have I said anything about changing my mind ?
no .
that &apos;s just it .
you haven &apos;t said anything about anything .
-Of course , it isn &apos;t loaded .
don &apos;t you think I know how to handle a gun ?
I don &apos;t know what to think , Homer .
all I know is , I was in love with you when you left and I &apos;m in love with you now .
other things may have changed , but that hasn &apos;t .
you wanna see how the hooks work ? you wanna see the freak ?
take a good look .
I didn &apos;t mean anything , Homer .
I was only ....
I &apos;m sorry , Luella .
it isn &apos;t your fault .
go on and play with your friends .
I was wrong .
I shouldn &apos;t have acted like that .
it wasn &apos;t her that burned my hands off .
I just gotta work it out myself .
-I could help you , Homer , if you &apos;d let me .
-I &apos;ve gotta work it out myself .
all I &apos;ve wanted is for people to treat me like anybody else instead of pitying me .
I guess it &apos;s hard for them to do that .
I &apos;ve just gotta learn to get used to it and pay no attention . -couldn &apos;t I-- ?
-No , I &apos;ve gotta do it myself .
-Okay , Pop , I &apos;m going to bed now .
be right with you , Homer .
good night , Pop .
thanks .
-What you got there ? -Our supper .
cream of corn soup , potato salad , salami and liverwurst .
we &apos;re going to Jackie &apos;s Hot Spot .
I phoned and made a reservation .
we &apos;re eating at home .
what &apos;s the matter , honey ?
you sick or something ? no , dear .
broke .
-you got it .
but what happened ?
where did it go to ?
we spent it , babe .
that &apos;s what happened . I &apos;m sorry it &apos;s so sudden .
I didn &apos;t tell you the money was almost gone because every day I kept hoping I was gonna land a job .
at last I got it through my thick skull that I &apos;m not going to get one so we &apos;ll have to forget about Jackie &apos;s Hot Spot and the Blue Devil and all the rest .
-you really been trying ? -Sure .
I &apos;ve been all over town .
all the employment offices and the USES .
they say I ought to spend a couple of years as an apprentice or go to a trade school .
a couple of years with you going to kindergarten .
and what would I be doing in the meantime ?
well , you could always help me with my homework .
-Yep ? are you really all right ?
of course , I &apos;m all right .
why ? -I mean , in your mind .
is there anything-- ?
-My mind ?
you mean you think I &apos;m going goofy ?
I &apos;ve been wondering . what was Gadosky ?
where did you hear about him ?
you talk in your sleep , honey .
sometimes you shout .
something &apos;s on fire and you want somebody to get out . you keep saying , &quot; Gadosky , Gadosky . &quot;
Gadorsky .
Oh , he was a friend of mine , a B-17 pilot .
he got it over Berlin .
can &apos;t you get those things out of your system ?
-Oh , sure . -Maybe that &apos;s what &apos;s holding you back .
the war &apos;s over .
you won &apos;t get any place till you stop thinking about it .
okay , honey , I &apos;ll do that .
I didn &apos;t tell you , Fred , but I got a little money saved .
dinner &apos;s on me tonight . you &apos;d better keep on saving it , babe .
it might come in handy sometime .
I appreciate the offer , but we &apos;re eating at home .
well , I &apos;m hungry .
I &apos;m going out by myself .
you &apos;re not going out . you &apos;re gonna stay here ...
- ... and eat what I cook and like it .
-Let go of me .
when we were married , the justice of the peace said something about for richer , for poorer , for better , for worse .
remember ? -This is the worse .
-When do we get going on the better ?
whenever I get wise to myself , I guess .
whenever I wake up and realize I &apos;m not an officer and a gentleman anymore .
I &apos;m just another soda jerk out of a job .
now , go on and sit down and read a magazine or listen to the radio while I cook the soup . I &apos;ll fix you a nice meal , honey .
just like I used to do behind the fountain , before the war .
the Perfume and Cosmetics Department is now our outstanding feature .
it accounts for 34 percent of our gross intake and a higher proportion of our profits .
as you will surmise , our customers in this department are almost exclusively women . Yes , I &apos;d surmised that .
Familiarize yourself with the pronunciation of the perfumes .
for instance , here &apos;s a popular number . -Rêve Romantique . -Yeah , that means romantic dream .
-you speak French ?
-Well , I &apos;ll tell you , Sticky just enough to make my way around the Paris bars .
let &apos;s get one thing straight , Derry .
the name Sticky is out .
-Yes , Mr. Merkel . I understand .
-This week , we &apos;re pushing the new champagne bubble bath preparation .
a dollar ninety-eight for the large jar .
down here are some special made-
- Come here .
down here are some specially made-up toilet sets .
they don &apos;t represent a very great .... -Good morning , Mr. Brook .
I have an appointment with you .
-Good morning . -Good morning .
good morning , Mrs. Garrett .
what have we here ?
the Bretton Woods agreement ?
that &apos;s a Mr. Novak waiting over there .
I &apos;ve filled out the basic form . he &apos;s applying for a GI loan .
-Oh , good . I &apos;ll see him .
-Mr . Novak .
-Sit down , Mr. Novak .
-Thank you , sir .
don &apos;t sir me , Mr. Novak .
-Yes , sir .
I mean , yes , I was in the Seabees .
where &apos;d you operate ?
all over the Pacific .
one little after island after another .
what &apos;d you do , mostly ?
we went in before the landings and cleared the mines and underwater obstructions .
when they &apos;d taken enough ground for an airstrip , we &apos;d build it . fairly interesting work , eh ?
no , it got monotonous .
those islands all look alike .
until Iwo Jima . that was different .
so I &apos;ve heard .
I see you have quite a family .
a wife and four children .
Yes , there &apos;d have been more if I hadn &apos;t been away three years .
-And now you wanna buy a farm .
-Yes , sir .
got my eye on a fine piece of property .
Forty acres , out near Anton Corners .
what about collateral ?
collateral ?
security for your loan .
what can you put up in the way of property ?
have you any stocks and bonds , real estate , valuables of any kind ?
well , no , Mr. Stephenson , you see , the point is , I haven &apos;t got any property .
that &apos;s why I want the loan , so I can get the property .
I see .
no collateral .
that makes things difficult .
I &apos;m a good farmer , Mr. Stephenson .
why , even during the war I kept my hand in .
I used to spend my spare time down on those little islands working truck gardens so my outfit could have fresh tomatoes and green corn and all that .
and before the war , I was a sharecropper , like my father before me .
and now , I feel I &apos;d like to have a little piece of my own to work . -you like to grow things , eh ?
-Yes , sir .
with the food shortage all over the world it &apos;s seems to me that farming &apos;s about the most important work there is .
I mean ....
well , don &apos;t you think so , Mr. Stephenson ?
Yes .
you see , Mr. Stephenson I don &apos;t feel this is asking the bank for a handout .
at least , that &apos;s what I &apos;ve been told by other ex-servicemen that the government guarantees loans to us , if we wanna buy--
your loan would be administered through this bank which would put up half of the $ 6000 you require .
now , that involves risk for this bank , Mr. Novak .
-Look at you .
-Look at you .
-So this is where you work . -Sort of .
what are you doing here ? sticking up the bank ?
look at it , Al , 200 leaves of cabbage .
that &apos;s what I get every month from Old Mr. Whiskers from now on .
-Pretty soft , eh ? -Pretty soft .
-you sure we haven &apos;t shortchanged you ?
-Oh , no . I kept my eye on that guy when he counted it out .
say , Al , did you know Fred Derry had a job at the Midway drugstore ?
no , I didn &apos;t .
-He introduced me to his wife .
-Yeah ?
-Some dish . -Yeah .
we &apos;ll all have to get together at Butch &apos;s .
fine . Oh , that &apos;s where I &apos;m going now .
-Yeah ?
-Take a piano lesson .
take one for me .
-See you later . Bye .
-So long , Homer .
well , as I was saying , Mr. Novak there is an element of risk involved .
we &apos;ll have to have the property appraised , but you &apos;ll get your loan .
say , Mr. Stephenson ...
- ... I don &apos;t know how to begin to thank you . -Don &apos;t try .
you look like a good risk to me .
and when those tomato plants start producing , I &apos;ll come for free samples .
I &apos;ll let you know when the papers are ready .
thank you , sir . thank you .
God bless you .
Oh , I &apos;ve seen advertisements about this one . night of Bliss .
is it all that they say it is ?
well , just what do they say it is ?
haunting , provocative , languorous .
Oh , yes , I &apos;m sure it &apos;s all of those .
my name ain &apos;t Bud . -Dexter , you stop that .
do you hear ?
-I just wanted to see how it worked .
-Sorry . you heard what Mommy said .
-It &apos;s all right .
Seduction . how much is that ?
this is ....
it &apos;s quite expensive .
it &apos;s 16.50 , but it &apos;s a nice size .
you see what I mean ? but it &apos;s a good , safe bet .
just what do you mean by that ?
well , I mean it &apos;s ....
well , it &apos;s a perfume that fits any mood .
all right , I &apos;ll take it .
very good , madam .
mommy , Mommy , look !
I shot it down !
I shot down a plane !
-Oh , hello .
-Hello .
thank you very much .
I &apos;ll be with you in just a moment , madam .
will you take this , please ?
this lady will have your package and your change in a moment .
thank you very much and come in again .
thank you .
-you were wonderful .
-I wanted to smack him .
it &apos;s against the rules here to chat with customers unless it &apos;s a sale .
all right , I &apos;ll buy something .
what &apos;s this ?
youth Recaptured , that &apos;s a complexion cream .
but you don &apos;t need any of that phony stuff . well , that &apos;s vanishing cream .
this is a vanishing cream remover .
I &apos;ll tell you how you can save money .
if you don &apos;t put that on , then you don &apos;t need this to take that off .
how about some lotion ?
here &apos;s one at $ 2.98 , and you &apos;d be over charged at half the price .
I didn &apos;t really come in to buy anything .
Dad told me you were working here and I just dropped in to say hello .
Oh , just a minute .
I have ....
I have an hour off at 1 : 00 . are you doing anything for lunch ?
why , no .
thank you , madam .
I &apos;ll meet you outside in 20 minutes .
-Come in again .
-Thank you .
the apple pie , she &apos;s homemade . -Good .
-Thank you .
it is a nice little place .
I never heard of it before .
I used to come here now and then in the old days , before the war .
sometimes I used to think of this place when I was overseas .
I thought , &quot; When I get back home I &apos;m never gonna eat in a dump like Lucia &apos;s . &quot;
what else did you think you wouldn &apos;t do when you were overseas ?
I never had any clear ideas , but there were two things I was sure of .
one , that I knew I &apos;d never go back to that drugstore .
-What was the other thing ? -That was even sillier .
I dreamed I was gonna have my own home .
just a nice little house for my wife and me out in the country in the suburbs , anyway .
that &apos;s the cockeyed kind of dream you have when you &apos;re overseas .
you don &apos;t have to be overseas to have dreams like that . Yeah .
you can get crazy ideas right here at home .
didn &apos;t you say you had to be back at work at 2 ? Yeah .
well , hadn &apos;t you better ... ?
check , please .
Eighty-five cents apiece for lunch , plus tax , that &apos;s a $ 1.76 .
okay . thank you very much .
-Goodbye .
-Bye .
Goodbye , signorina .
come again . we &apos;ll do that .
so long , Giuseppe .
Arrivederci , sir .
well ....
that shouldn &apos;t have happened .
but I guess it had to .
-Goodbye , Peggy . -Goodbye .
we were discussing this loan to this man .... What &apos;s his name ?
Novak .
Yes , yes , I approved it .
well , may I ask , Al , on what basis ?
on the basis of my own judgment .
-Novak looked to me like a good bet .
-But the man has no collateral , no security .
-Evidently , you saw something in this man . -Yes , Mr. Milton .
-What was it ?
-Security .
collateral .
Mr. Milton , in the Army I &apos;ve had to be with men when they were stripped of everything in the way of property except what they carried around with them and inside them .
I saw them being tested . some of them stood up to it and some didn &apos;t .
but you got so you could tell which ones you could count on .
I tell you , this man Novak is okay .
his collateral is in his hands , in his heart , in his guts . -In his right as a citizen . -Nobody &apos;s denying him his rights .
Yes , we are .
if we deny him his chance to work in his own way .
gentlemen , there &apos;s no need to raise our voices .
of course , since you &apos;ve approved the loan , the incident is closed . -However , in the future , Al--
-Yes , I understand , Mr. Milton .
in the future , I must exercise more caution .
thank you , Mr. Prew .
Al .
Al , you know how I feel about you and always have .
why , I &apos;ve always considered you one of the family , so to speak . like my own s-
- Younger brother .
I picked you personally for this job , and I know you &apos;ll make good . and we do .
we have every desire to extend a helping hand to returning veterans whenever possible .
but we must all remember that this is not our money we &apos;re doling out .
it belongs to our depositors and we can &apos;t gamble with it . I &apos;ll remember , Mr. Milton .
we &apos;ll meet at the Union Club at 7 : 30 .
-And give my best to your charming wife .
-Thank you , Mr. Milton .
Oh , hello .
say , better hurry and get dressed . and wear your new suit .
we &apos;re going out to dinner at the Embassy Club .
Oh , don &apos;t worry , it won &apos;t cost a nickel .
we got invited .
-Who invited us ?
-Ms . Peggy Stephenson .
she called up a little while ago and said her father was a friend of yours .
she sounded like a nice kid .
she &apos;s going with some boyfriend of hers and asked us to come on a double date , as guests . -you told her we could go ?
-you bet I did .
well , call her up and tell her we can &apos;t go .
tell her I made another engagement . tell her anything .
say , who is this Peggy Stephenson ? -She &apos;s a girl .
-I didn &apos;t think she was a kangaroo .
where did you meet her ?
I told you the night I got back and you weren &apos;t here .
Al Stephenson and his wife took me home . she &apos;s their daughter .
I &apos;d never seen her before .
or since ?
if you think you &apos;re gonna make anything out of this , you &apos;re due for a disappointment .
I just don &apos;t like accepting handouts when we &apos;re broke . well , you &apos;d better get used to it .
because I don &apos;t see how we &apos;re gonna get much fun on your 32.50 a week .
hold still .
you &apos;ll probably have to make a speech .
it &apos;s my plan to meet that situation by getting well plastered . Peggy &apos;s going out dancing with Woody Merrill .
-Who &apos;s he ?
-you know , Bill Merrill &apos;s son .
Oh , yeah .
fine people , the Merrills .
strictly TCR .
-What &apos;s that ?
-Top credit rating .
-Are his intentions honorable ?
-I doubt it .
but they &apos;re going to be properly chaperoned by Fred Derry and his wife .
Fred Derry ? some chaperone .
-I think she &apos;s crazy about him .
no , Fred .
have you got any evidence to support that amazing statement ?
just a hunch .
but my hunches are pretty good .
-Cocktails . -Oh , no , you don &apos;t .
I made this for Woody Merrill , he &apos;s coming to pick me up .
surely you wouldn &apos;t deny your poor old father a drop on a cold night like this . I would if I could .
-I hear you &apos;re gonna see Fred .
what &apos;s his wife like ?
I don &apos;t know .
I &apos;ll tell you later .
they &apos;ll have cocktails at the Union Club .
I know the kind Mrs. Milton serves . pink , sweet and nauseating .
I was just asking Peggy about Fred &apos;s wife .
I know what you &apos;re both thinking .
what are we thinking ?
you &apos;re afraid I may be in love with Fred .
-Why , I never had any such id--
are you in love with him ?
Yes .
but I don &apos;t want to be .
that &apos;s why I asked him and his wife to go out with us this evening .
I think it ought to have a very healthy effect on me . once I get to know her , I ....
well , I &apos;m sure I &apos;ll stop being silly about the whole thing .
we don &apos;t need to worry about that child . she can take care of herself .
that &apos;s what she thinks .
-Good evening . -you know my father .
-Mr .
Stephenson .
nice to see you again .
-Have a drink ? -Thank you .
I &apos;ve played a lot of golf with your father .
I know .
been to the club since you got back ? -Haven &apos;t had a chance .
-Come on , we &apos;ll be late .
-Right . -Good night .
-Night .
-Well , have a good time , children .
thank you .
give my best to Fred .
Al , come on .
Yes , Mr. Milton .
-Hello , Peggy .
-Oh , Woody , don &apos;t be a bore .
come on , we &apos;ll be late .
our country must stand today where it has always stood the citadel of individual initiative the land of unlimited opportunity for all .
it is peculiarly appropriate that we meet here tonight to honor one who has valiantly fought for that freedom .
ladies and gentlemen , we greet our friend our coworker , our hero , Al Stephenson .
come on , on your feet , Al .
on your feet .
ladies and gentlemen , I &apos;m very happy to be here .
in fact , I &apos;m very happy to be anywhere .
in fact , I &apos;m very happy .
perhaps it &apos;d be a good idea , if you just put that bottle right down here in front of me .
-Here , save yourself quite a number of trips .
-Good old Al .
and I &apos;m glad to see you &apos;ve all pulled through so well .
as Mr. Milton so perfectly expressed it , our country stands today where it stands today .
wherever that is .
and I &apos;m sure you &apos;d all agree with me if I said that now &apos;s the time for all of us to stop all this nonsense face facts , get down to brass tacks , forget about the war , and go fishing .
but I &apos;m not gonna say it .
I &apos;m just going to sum the whole thing up in one word .
my wife doesn &apos;t think I &apos;d better sum it up in that one word .
I wanna tell you that the reason for my success as a sergeant is due primarily to my previous training in the Corn Belt Loan and Trust Company .
the knowledge I acquired in the good old bank I applied to my problems in the infantry .
for instance , in Okinawa , a major comes to me he says , &quot; Stephenson , you see that hill ? &quot; &quot; Yes , sir .
I see it . &quot; &quot; all right , &quot; he said .
&quot; you and your platoon will attack said hill and take it . &quot;
so I said to the major , &quot; But that operation involves considerable risk .
we haven &apos;t sufficient collateral . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m aware of that , &quot; said the major , &quot; but the fact remains , that there is the hill and you are the guys who are going to take it . &quot;
so I said to him , &quot; I &apos;m sorry , major .
no collateral , no hill . &quot;
so we didn &apos;t take the hill , and we lost the war .
I think that little story has considerable significance .
but I &apos;ve forgotten what it is .
and now , in conclusion , I &apos;d like to tell you a humorous anecdote .
I know several humorous anecdotes but I can &apos;t think of any way to clean them up .
so I &apos;ll only say this much .
I love the Corn Belt Loan and Trust Company .
there are some who say that the old bank is suffering from hardening of the arteries and of the heart .
I refuse to listen to such radical talk .
I say that our bank is alive , it &apos;s generous , it &apos;s .... It &apos;s human !
and we &apos;re going to have such a line of customers seeking and getting small loans that people will think we &apos;re gambling with the depositors &apos; money .
and we will be .
we &apos;ll be gambling on the future of this country .
I thank you .
Oh , Woody , I can &apos;t take it anymore .
let &apos;s sit down .
we can &apos;t get out .
I &apos;m trapped .
how do you do ?
beg your pardon .
well , anyway , we can &apos;t fall down .
-Is that table satisfactory ?
-Everything . everything &apos;s lovely .
thank you very much .
would you care to order now ?
sorry .
-Oh , I can &apos;t understand it .
-What ?
why you &apos;re not mad about me .
I think I &apos;m attractive .
-you are , Woody .
you &apos;re irresistible .
-Then why do you go on resisting me ?
you know , all marriages don &apos;t have to be like that one .
-Which one ?
-Your friends , Fred and Marie .
what &apos;s wrong with their marriage ?
Oh , there &apos;s nothing wrong , except for one slight detail .
they just don &apos;t like each other .
Oh , it &apos;s murder on the dance floor . Oh , it &apos;s awful .
you mean you don &apos;t wanna dance anymore ?
I &apos;d love to !
you don &apos;t you mind if I borrow him for a while ?
no , not at all .
why did you do this , Peggy ?
-Do what ?
what do you mean ?
-Calling up Marie and going out like this . together .
-I did it deliberately .
to prove to myself that what happened this afternoon didn &apos;t really happen .
but it did happen .
it had to happen .
and if we go on seeing each other , Peggy , it &apos;ll happen again .
excuse us .
excuse me .
excuse me .
Oh , we wanna have a picture taken over there in a few minutes .
fine , I &apos;ll be there .
excuse me .
Hello , Marie .
good evening .
you gotta watch yourself in this town .
more wolves .
-I know .
-I pay no attention to the sign . go right in .
gee , Woody &apos;s a cute boy . he &apos;s a lot of fun .
he &apos;s got a lot of dough too .
his family owns half the city , practically .
certainly has a terrific yen for you , Peggy .
I don &apos;t wanna butt into your personal affairs but if you &apos;ll take my advice , dear , you &apos;ll grab Woody , but quick .
Woody and I are good friends , but there &apos;s no romance there .
never mind the romantic part .
that takes care of itself . and I &apos;m speaking from experience .
they &apos;ll tell you money isn &apos;t everything .
well , maybe it isn &apos;t , but , boy , how it helps .
do you know that while Fred was away , I was drawing over $ 500 a month ?
I mean , from his Army pay and the job I had .
now the two of us gotta live on what Fred gets from being a drugstore cowboy .
Thirty-two fifty a week .
poor Fred .
I guess you think he &apos;s an awful sourpuss .
he didn &apos;t used to be that way , though .
army &apos;s had an awful effect on him .
knocked all the life out of him .
Fred isn &apos;t going to be satisfied with that job at the drugstore .
-He &apos;ll get something better . -Oh , sure .
maybe in five years he &apos;ll be drawing down 40 or 50 bucks .
you can &apos;t have happy marriages on that kind of dough .
you know , Peggy , you &apos;re cute .
but if you don &apos;t mind a personal suggestion , you could use more makeup .
and I think you could get yourself a better hairdo .
I &apos;ll give you the name of my hairdresser .
Oh , but you &apos;ve got nothing to worry about .
you &apos;ll get Woody and live happily ever after .
it &apos;s in the bag .
thank you .
now , everybody get in close together , we &apos;re all palsy-walsy put our arms around each other .
come on , Fred .
I don &apos;t mind .
wait a minute , I &apos;ll tell you when .
everybody , happy .
let &apos;s all be talking .
what a marvelous party .
we &apos;ll have to do this again , right away .
okay , shoot the picture !
we want four copies , honey .
Mr. Milton certainly acted enthusiastic about your speech .
Yeah , sure , that &apos;s how he acted , the old hypocrite .
suppose he &apos;ll fire you in the morning ?
no , he &apos;ll never do anything as impetuous as that .
he &apos;ll back me up wholeheartedly till the next time I give a loan to some little guy .
then I &apos;ll have to fight it out all over again . -Yes ?
-It &apos;s me , Peggy .
Oh , come in , darling .
-Did you have a good time ?
-Not very .
what &apos;s all this ?
children &apos;s hour ?
I beg your pardon .
well , what &apos;s she like ?
I &apos;m glad I went out with them .
even though it was a pretty disagreeable experience .
it took guts , honey , which you got plenty .
I &apos;ll need them .
-I &apos;ve made up my mind .
-Good girl .
to do what ?
I &apos;m going to break that marriage up .
I can &apos;t stand it seeing Fred tied to a woman he doesn &apos;t love .
and who doesn &apos;t love him .
Oh , it &apos;s horrible for him .
it &apos;s humiliating and it &apos;s killing his spirit .
somebody &apos;s got to help him .
-Are you sure he doesn &apos;t love her ?
-Of course I am .
did he tell you ?
-Did she ?
-No .
so you just jumped to conclusions .
he doesn &apos;t love her , he hates her .
I know it , I know it .
who are you ?
how did you get this power to interfere in other people &apos;s lives ?
is Fred in love with you ?
Yes .
-you &apos;ve been seeing him ?
-Only once .
today .
Oh , it was all perfectly respectable .
but when we were saying goodbye he took me in his arms and kissed me and I knew .
and you think a kiss from a smooth operator like Fred you think that means anything ?
you don &apos;t know him .
you don &apos;t know anything about what &apos;s inside him .
neither does she . his wife .
that &apos;s probably what she thought when she married him .
a smooth operator with money in his pockets .
but now he isn &apos;t smooth any longer , and she &apos;s lost interest in him .
whereas you &apos;re possessed of all the wisdom of the ages .
you can see into the secret recesses of his innermost soul .
I can see because I love him .
so you &apos;re gonna break this marriage up .
have you decided yet how you &apos;re gonna do it ?
you gonna do it with an ax ?
it &apos;s none of your business how I &apos;m going to do it .
you &apos;ve forgotten what it &apos;s like to be in love !
you hear that , Milly ?
I &apos;m so old and decrepit , I &apos;ve forgotten how it feels to want somebody desperately .
Peggy didn &apos;t mean that . did you , darling ?
no .
I don &apos;t know what I do mean .
it &apos;s just that everything has always been so perfect for you .
you loved each other and you got married in a big church and you had a honeymoon in the south of France .
and you never had any trouble of any kind .
so how can you possibly understand how it is with Fred and me ?
we never had any trouble .
how many times have I told you I hated you and believed it in my heart ?
how many times have you said you were sick and tired of me that we were all washed up ?
how many times have we had to fall in love all over again ?
-I &apos;m sorry , Mom .
-Oh , never mind about that , darling .
-Fred .
-Hi , Butch .
-Hello , Fred . -Al here ?
-Yeah , he &apos;s back there waiting for you .
-See you later .
-Hi , Al .
-Sit down , Fred .
-What are you drinking ? -a cup of coffee .
gotta have a clear head for soda jerking .
-a cup of coffee and a bourbon and soda . -Yes , sir .
well , what &apos;s on your mind , Al ?
wanna borrow some money or something ?
I called you to ask you a question .
okay .
shoot .
are you in love with Peggy ?
is there any law compelling me to answer that one ? no .
nevertheless , I repeat .
are you in love with Peggy ?
Yes .
-I thank you for a short and honest answer .
-you &apos;re welcome .
-Now , what do we take up next ?
-Your wife .
what about her ?
where does she fit in this romantic situation ?
is that any of your business ?
that &apos;s what Peggy said , that it &apos;s none of my business .
Oh , you &apos;ve had her on the carpet too .
she volunteered some information to her mother and me .
you see , we have a rather unusual relationship in our family .
it may seem kind of corny and mid-Victorian , but we tell each other things .
I happen to be quite fond of Peggy , and I ....
you don &apos;t want her to get mixed up with a heel like me .
I haven &apos;t called you a heel .
I just don &apos;t wanna see her get into this mess .
okay , chum , what do we do now ?
step out and settle this thing in the alley ?
I wouldn &apos;t wanna recommend that as a solution .
I &apos;ve learned a lot of tricks in fighting dirty .
if I got tangled up with you , I might forget myself and break your neck .
I wouldn &apos;t like that .
you see , Fred , I &apos;m quite fond of you too .
thanks .
but I don &apos;t like the idea of you sneaking around corners to see Peggy taking her love on a bootleg basis .
I &apos;m gonna do everything I can to keep her away from you , to help her forget about you and get her married to some decent guy who can make her happy .
then I guess that &apos;s it , Al .
I don &apos;t see her anymore .
I &apos;ll put that in the form of a guarantee .
I won &apos;t see her anymore .
I &apos;ll call her up and tell her so .
-That satisfy you ?
-Yeah .
-Anything else on your mind ?
-No .
okay , chum , so long .
so long , Fred .
the drinks are on me .
-Hello , Homer .
-Hi , Steve .
say , Al Stephenson &apos;s back there . -Al ?
-Yeah .
-Hello , Homer .
-How are you ?
how &apos;s the family ?
-Fine , thanks .
-Hello , Homer .
-Hi , Butch .
-Say , let &apos;s show Al that new routine . -Why , sure .
got something to show you , Al .
well , come on .
-Boy , wait till you hear this .
-Are you all set , kid ?
-I &apos;m ready when you are . -Okay .
one , two , three .
didn &apos;t you like it ?
we &apos;ve been working for weeks .
sure , Homer , it was swell .
I thought you were kidding about those piano lessons . Fred !
Hey , Fred !
that was Fred . Yeah .
-What &apos;s the matter ?
is anything wrong ?
-He had to go back to the drugstore .
come on , Homer , buy me a drink .
who was it ? Fred .
he said he &apos;s sorry for what happened , but it was just one of those things .
he said it wouldn &apos;t be fair to his wife for us to see each other anymore because I &apos;m obviously the kind of girl that takes these things too seriously .
then he said goodbye , very politely , and hung up .
well , I guess you and Dad won &apos;t have to worry about me anymore .
that &apos;s the end of my career as a home wrecker .
mom , I know you feel sorry for me .
you think my poor little heart is broken .
but you can save your sympathy .
I can see things clearer now .
I made a fool of myself .
I &apos;m getting some sense hammered into me now .
I &apos;m glad I &apos;m out of that mess .
I &apos;m glad I &apos;ll never see him again !
two chocolate sundaes coming up .
what about a ham and cheese on whole wheat without any mustard ?
ham and cheese , dark , save the mustard , coming up .
here you are . thank you .
-Hello , Homer . -Hi , Fred .
how &apos;ve you been ?
glad to see you . -Say , Fred .
-Yeah ?
what happened at Butch &apos;s ?
-What do you mean ? -I mean , you and Al .
was there any trouble ?
Oh , no , we were just having a little friendly chat .
-There you are , sir . -Thanks .
-What &apos;ll it be , Homer ?
-Oh , I don &apos;t care .
-Give me a chocolate sundae .
-Okay .
Hi .
-How are you , soldier ? -Sailor .
excuse me .
say do you mind if I ask you a personal question ?
I know what it is .
how did I get these hooks , and how do they work ?
that &apos;s what everybody says when they start off :
&quot; do you mind if I ask you a personal question ? &quot; well , I &apos;ll tell you .
I got sick and tired of that old pair of hands I had .
you know , an awful lot of trouble washing them and manicuring my nails .
so I traded them in for a pair of these latest models .
they work by radar .
look .
-Pretty cute , eh ?
-you got plenty of guts .
it &apos;s terrible when you see a guy like you that had to sacrifice himself . and for what ?
and for what ?
I don &apos;t get you , mister .
-Well--
-Anything else for you ? check .
we let ourselves get sold down the river .
-we were pushed into war .
-Sure , by the Japs and the Nazis . -So we had--
-The Germans and the Japs had nothing against us .
they wanted to fight the Limeys and the Reds .
and they would &apos;ve whipped them too if we didn &apos;t get deceived into it by a bunch of radicals in Washington .
what are you talking about ?
we fought the wrong people , that &apos;s all .
just read the facts , my friend .
find out for yourself why you had to lose your hands .
and then go do something about it .
you &apos;d better pay your check , brother , and go home .
-Well , who do you think you are ? -Pay the cashier right over there .
-Coffee , please .
-Yes , ma &apos;am .
there &apos;s another thing .
every soda jerk in this country has got an idea he &apos;s somebody .
look here , mister , what are you selling anyway ?
I &apos;m not selling anything but plain old-fashioned Americanism . some Americanism .
so we &apos;re all a bunch of suckers , eh ?
so we should &apos;ve been on the side of the Japs and the Nazis ?
again , I say , just look at the facts .
I &apos;ve seen a couple of facts .
I &apos;ve seen a ship go down and over 400 of my shipmates went with it .
were those guys suckers ?
that &apos;s the unpleasant truth .
and the sooner we get wise to it , the better off we &apos;re--
-Oh , if I only had my hands !
-you put those down !
take your hands off of him !
may I get through , please ? -Go get the druggist .
-Yes , sir .
-Make way , please .
what happened ?
-It was Fred Derry .
he hit him .
bring some spirits of ammonia , iodine and bandages .
Yes , sir .
don &apos;t say it , chum .
the customer &apos;s always right , so I &apos;m fired . but this customer wasn &apos;t right .
I &apos;ll meet you outside in a minute , kid .
gee , Fred , I &apos;m sorry I lost you your job .
-But that guy--
-Yeah , I know .
you read about guys like that , but you don &apos;t often see them , luckily . how about your girlfriend , Wilma ?
you and she gonna get married ?
-I don &apos;t know . -Why don &apos;t you know ?
-Doesn &apos;t she want to get married ?
-Oh , it isn &apos;t Wilma &apos;s fault .
she &apos;s been swell about it .
-So then it &apos;s your fault ?
-Yeah , I .... I guess it is .
-Will you do me a favor , Homer ? -Sure , Fred , what is it ?
I &apos;m a hot one to be giving advice to the lovelorn , but go see Wilma now .
take her in your arms , kiss her , ask her to marry you , then marry her .
tomorrow , if you can get a license that fast .
if you want anybody to stand up for you at your wedding .... -There &apos;s my bus .
so long , kid .
-So long , Fred .
-you all right , Homer ?
-Yes , Pop , I &apos;m going to get a glass of milk .
well , just knock on the door when you want me .
okay .
Wilma .
what are you doing out this hour of night ?
I saw you were up , Homer .
I saw you through the window .
-I &apos;ve got to talk to you .
-All right , come in .
-Want some chicken ?
-No , thanks .
-Sure ?
-Yes .
-Want a glass of milk ?
-No , thanks , Homer .
sit down , Wilma .
Homer , my family want me to go away .
-Where ?
-Up to Silver Lake , at my Aunt Vera &apos;s place .
that ought to be nice .
but I don &apos;t want to go .
I want to stay here .
you see , the reason they want me to go is so that I &apos;ll forget about you .
they figure you don &apos;t want me around , you don &apos;t wanna see me and if I go away for a while , maybe I &apos;ll get all this out of my mind .
maybe that &apos;s a good idea , Wilma .
maybe you ought to do that .
do you wanna get rid of me ?
tell me the truth , Homer .
do you want me to forget about you ?
I want you to be free , Wilma .
to live your own life .
I don &apos;t want you tied down forever just because you &apos;ve got a kind heart .
Homer , why can &apos;t you ever understand the way things really are the way I really feel ?
I keep trying to tell you .
but you don &apos;t know , Wilma .
you don &apos;t know what it &apos;d be like to have to live with me to have to face this every day , every night .
but I can only find out by trying .
and if it turns out I haven &apos;t courage enough , we &apos;ll soon know it .
Wilma , you and I have been close to each other for a long time , haven &apos;t we ?
ever since we were kids .
Yes , Homer .
I &apos;m going upstairs to bed .
I want you to come up and see for yourself what happens .
all right , Homer .
I &apos;ve learned how to take this harness off .
I can wiggle into my pajama top .
I &apos;m lucky , I have my elbows .
some of the boys don &apos;t .
but I can &apos;t button them up .
I &apos;ll do that , Homer .
this is when I know I &apos;m helpless .
my hands are down there on the bed .
I can &apos;t put them on again without calling to somebody for help .
I can &apos;t smoke a cigarette or read a book .
if that door should blow shut , I can &apos;t open it and get out of this room .
I &apos;m as dependent as a baby that doesn &apos;t know how to get anything except cry for it .
well , now you know , Wilma .
now you have an idea of what it is .
I guess you don &apos;t know what to say .
it &apos;s all right .
go on home .
go away , like your family said .
I know what to say , Homer .
I love you .
and I &apos;m never going to leave you .
never .
you mean you didn &apos;t mind ?
of course not .
I told you I loved you .
I love you , Wilma .
I always have , and I always will .
good night , darling .
sleep well .
good night , Wilma .
Hey , Sugar .
you &apos;d better step on it , or your husband will be home .
Oh , don &apos;t worry . he &apos;s job hunting .
he won &apos;t come home for another hour .
-And what if he does ? -I don &apos;t understand it .
guy like that with all this money around and he can &apos;t get into it .
-What &apos;s the matter with him ?
-I guess he just isn &apos;t very bright .
how do you do ? fine , thanks .
who are you ?
Fred , I want you to meet Cliff Scully , an old friend of mine .
-Hi , Freddy .
-Glad to know you , Scully . get out .
a tough guy , huh ?
now listen , Fred .
you &apos;re not gonna get anywhere with that attitude .
cliff Scully &apos;s an old friend of mine .
he &apos;s asked me out , and I &apos;m going out . if you don &apos;t like it , you know what you can do .
you heard me , chum .
get out .
-What do I do next ?
smack him .
-Why ask her ?
can &apos;t you think for yourself ? go on Cliff .
I can handle this .
wait for me downstairs .
okay .
another ex-serviceman , huh ?
Greetings , brother .
have you had any trouble getting readjusted ?
not in particular .
it &apos;s easy if you just take everything in your stride .
that &apos;s what I &apos;ve heard .
-Be seeing you .
-I doubt it .
-When did you pick him up ? -I told you .
he &apos;s an old friend .
he just dropped in for a friendly drink .
-Did you know him while I was away ?
-I knew lots of people .
what do you think I was doing all those years ?
-I don &apos;t know , but I can guess .
-Go ahead , guess your head off .
I could do some guessing myself .
what were you up to in London and Paris and all those places ?
I &apos;ve given you every chance to make something of yourself .
I gave up my own job when you asked me .
I gave up the best years of my life . and what have you done ?
you &apos;ve flopped .
couldn &apos;t even hold that job at the drugstore .
so I &apos;m going back to work for myself .
that means I &apos;m going to live for myself too .
and in case you don &apos;t understand English , I &apos;m gonna get a divorce .
what have you got to say to that ?
don &apos;t keep Cliff waiting .
-What are you gonna do ?
-I &apos;m going away . -Where ?
-As far away from Boone City as I can get .
that &apos;s a good idea . you &apos;ll get a good job someplace else .
there are drugstores everywhere .
here &apos;s an old sweater I found .
-Remember you wore it in high school ?
-you might need it sometime . -Thanks , Hortense .
-you forgot these , son .
-Oh , I don &apos;t want them , Pop .
what are they ?
just a lot of fancy words that don &apos;t mean anything .
you can throw them away . say , these are citations for your medals .
why , Freddy , you never showed them to us .
those things came in the packages of K rations .
well , we &apos;ll treasure them , my boy .
I &apos;ll get the socks I washed for you .
-Think you &apos;re doing the right thing , son ?
-you mean going ? who &apos;s to say in advance whether it &apos;s the right thing or the wrong thing ?
it just means a fresh start in some other place .
how do you know it &apos;ll be different anyplace else ?
there &apos;s a need here for fellas like yourself that fought and won the war .
I know you haven &apos;t had the best of breaks since you got back but , well , it seems like you ought to stick here and slug it out a while longer on your own home ground .
you &apos;re all right , Pop .
but I know when it &apos;s time to bail out .
I gotta get going .
-Here are your clean socks , Fred .
-Just put them in here .
-Take good care of the old man , won &apos;t you ?
-I &apos;ll do my best . -But we &apos;ll miss you , Freddy .
-you ought to be used to that by now .
so long , Pop .
I &apos;ll tell you , captain .
we &apos;ve got two flights going out tonight . one eastbound , one westbound .
you &apos;ll have to ask the pilot .
-Which way you going ?
eastbound , 8 : 00 .
that &apos;ll be fine . I &apos;ll just hang around the field until then .
say , you don &apos;t seem to care where you &apos;re going .
that &apos;s right , chum .
Hortense .
Hortense !
listen to this .
sit down . &quot; headquarters , Eighth Air Force .

Hey , bud , what are you doing up there ?
Hey , you !
what are you doing in that airplane ?
I used to work in one of those .
Reviving old memories , huh ? Yeah , or maybe getting some of them out of my system .
well , take your last look at these crates .
we &apos;re breaking them up .
Yeah , I know . you &apos;re the junkman .
you get everything sooner or later .
this is no junk .
we &apos;re using this material for building prefabricated houses .
you don &apos;t need any help , do you ?
-Out of a job ?
-That &apos;s it . I see .
one of the fallen angels of the Air Force .
well , pardon me if I show no sympathy .
while you glamour boys were up in the wild blue yonder ... - ...
I was down in a tank . -Listen , chum . sometime I &apos;ll be glad to hear the story of your war experiences .
what I asked you for was a job .
have you got one ?
do you know anything about building ?
no . but there &apos;s one thing I do know , I know how to learn .
same as I learned that job up there .
-Hey , Gus .
-Yes ? see if you think this guy can be of any use to us .
thanks .
now , children , let &apos;s remember the words .
the bride will come down those stairs .
and when I see her , I &apos;ll hit the first note then I &apos;ll nod my head and then we &apos;ll sing .
all right , let &apos;s try it .
-Here she comes .
-Here . wait for the note .
that &apos;s fine .
-Mrs .
Cameron ?
-Yes . -Mrs .
Stephenson ?
-Yes . come right in , won &apos;t you ?
-My daughter .
-How do you do ? -How do you do ?
-How do you do , Mr. Stephenson ?
-For you . -Oh , my .
you shouldn &apos;t have .
-My daughter .
-Miss Stephenson .
-Hello . -Hello , Mr. Cameron .
-Pleasure . -Nice to see you . Homer &apos;s folks .
Mr. and Mrs. Stephenson .
Ms. Stephenson .
-How do you do ?
-How do you do ?
-Hello , Al .
good you &apos;re here . -Hello , Butch .
good to see you . thank you .
-Hello , Butch .
-How do you do , Mrs. Stephenson ? how do you do ?
steady , boy .
gee , Fred , you had me worried .
I heard you were leaving town . -I was afraid you wouldn &apos;t stand up for me .
-I &apos;ll stand up for you , kid , till I drop .
Oh , Fred , here &apos;s the ring .
don &apos;t lose it .
-Hi , Homer .
big day , huh ?
-Hi , Al . -Hi , Fred .
-Hello , Al .
-I hear you moved back with your folks .
I &apos;ve been sampling the punch .
I presume it was made for the kiddies .
-Will you have some , Homer ?
-I &apos;d better not , Al . -I might give the wrong answers .
-How about you , Fred ?
no , thanks .
maybe later .
well , if I must be a solitary drinker , good luck , kid .
thank you , Al .
-Al ! you promised you wouldn &apos;t .
-Now , listen , darling .
-Take a sip . -Fred . Homer .
you &apos;ll realize there isn &apos;t a headache in a barrel of it .
don &apos;t worry about Al , Mrs. Stephenson , he can take it .
-He certainly can .
-Excuse me . here , see for yourself .
Hello , Fred .
-Nice to see you again .
-Hello , Peggy . nice to see you .
well , what have you been doing with yourself lately ?
working .
Yes .
Dad told me he heard you were in some kind of building work .
well , that &apos;s a hopeful way of putting it .
I &apos;m really in the junk business .
an occupation for which many people feel I &apos;m well qualified by temperament and training .
it &apos;s fascinating work .
-Where &apos;s Homer ?
Wilma &apos;s ready .
-I &apos;ll get him . excuse me .
come on , children .
Mary , Kay , go ahead .
children .
over here .
watch me , now .
watch me .
dearly beloved , we are gathered together here in the sight of God and in the face of this company to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony .
if any man can show just cause why they may not lawfully be joined together let him now speak , or else here after forever hold his peace .
Homer , wilt thou have this woman to thy wedded wife ?
I will .
Wilma , wilt thou have this man to thy wedded husband ?
I will .
who gives this woman to be married to this man ?
I do .
now , Homer , will you take Wilma &apos;s right hand in yours and say after me .
I , Homer , take thee , Wilma , to my wedded wife .
I , Homer , take thee , Wilma , to my wedded wife .
to have and to hold from this day forward .
to have and to hold from this day forward .
for better , for worse .
for richer , for poorer .
for better , for worse .
for richer , for poorer .
in sickness and in health .
to love and to cherish till death us do part .

I , Wilma , take thee , Homer , to my wedded husband .

to love and to cherish till death us do part .
the ring .
place it on the fourth finger of Wilma &apos;s left hand .
repeat after me .
-With this ring , I thee wed .
-With this ring , I thee wed .
those whom God hath joined together , let not man put asunder .
for as much as Homer and Wilma have consented together in holy wedlock and have witnessed the same before God and this company and thereto have given and pledged their troth , each to the other and have declared the same by giving and receiving a ring and by joining hands I pronounce that they are man and wife .
God bless you both .
you know what it &apos;ll be , don &apos;t you , Peggy ?
it may take us years to get anywhere .
we &apos;ll have no money , no decent place to live .
we &apos;ll have to work , get kicked around ....
Hey , fellas , give a look . how about that good-bye drink , Johnny ?
- Why not ? one bar &apos;s just like another .
- So long as they got bourbon .
or a reasonable facsimile .
- Yes , sir ?
- Bourbon straight with a bourbon chaser .
- The same .
- Two separate glasses . get it ?
why wouldn &apos;t I get it ?
got to have that monkey music in here ?
- Somebody call me a monkey ?
- Give that thing a rest , will you ?
pipe down . it &apos;s his nickel .
somebody call me a monkey ?
nobody called nobody nothing . just forget it , will you ?
- That thing gives me a headache .
- Well , ain &apos;t that a pity .
- I told you I had a headache .
- Put that back , but quick .
- You put it back .
- Why you ...
quit it , Buzz !
- Steady , Corporal .
- Get out of my way !
I said steady . you didn &apos;t get those stripes from blowing your top .
Hey , cut that out . cut it out . do you hear ?
you two guys want to fight so bad , why don &apos;t you get into a uniform ?
what do you figure I had on when I got this ?
huh ?
what do you figure ?
there &apos;s a plate in there as big as your brains . maybe bigger .
well , I don &apos;t want no roughhouse in here .
go on , get back to your bar before you get a face full of knuckles .
come on , Buzz .
- Hey , who &apos;s paying for that broken cord ?
- Save it .
if it &apos;s long enough , you can hang yourself .
- Okay , now you got that out of your system .
- Thing was getting my goat .
- My mistake , fella .
- That &apos;s okay . skip it .
- So long .
- So long .
Bye .
Hey , we better get going , too , if we &apos;re gonna catch that bus .
Hey , look , dope , we already caught the bus .
- Yeah , that &apos;s right . we did , didn &apos;t we ?
- Yeah .
I must be getting dumb .
here &apos;s to you , Johnny .
Yeah , you lucky stiff , at least you got a wife to come home to .
boy , if I had a wife and kid to come home to ...
what &apos;s the matter ?
I must be getting old . that stuff kicks me right in the teeth .
when do we get to meet her , Johnny ?
any time . the door will always be open .
we won &apos;t need no dress suit to get in there , will we ?
that Cavendish Court hotel and bungalow sounds like a lot of dough .
- I ...
- I , uh ...
I got a lead on an apartment . if it comes through , we &apos;ll give you a ring .
good .
well , here &apos;s to what was .
- Take care of our boy , George .
- You bet I will .
- See you soon .
- Okay .
- Johnny ?
- Yeah ?
don &apos;t you think you ought to call her before you go home ?
maybe .
- He don &apos;t sound very happy , somehow .
- Mrs Morrison , please .
- What name shall I say ?
- Mrs Morrison &apos;s my wife .
- Oh , yes , sir .
Oh , would you mind if I surprised her ?
no , of course not . take Mr Morrison to bungalow 93 .
- This way , please .
- Thank you .
surprise is right .
- What did you say , honey ?
- Nothing to you .
some fun , huh ?
I &apos;ll take it from here .
thank you , sir .
Hi , beautiful ! looking for me ?
- I &apos;m afraid not . I &apos;m looking for my wife .
- The place is full of &apos; em .
you are beautiful . what &apos;s your name , huh ?
Morrison . does my wife live here ?
what &apos;s so funny ?
Hey , hey !
look who &apos;s here .
Helen &apos;s got a husband !
relax .
Hey , Helen , why didn &apos;t you tell us you had something like this ?
Johnny !
- Why didn &apos;t you let me know ?
- I wanted to surprise you .
well , take off your coat , Johnny . you &apos;re home , you know .
- It &apos;s been a long time , Helen .
- Much too long .
- You &apos;re not in uniform .
- No , they decided I had enough for a while .
- So they put me on the inactive list .
Buzz and George are out , too .
Buzz was wounded , and George &apos;s eyes went back on him .
- Buzz and George ?
- My crew .
I used to write you about them . don &apos;t you remember ?
Oh , sure . it &apos;s great to have you back , Johnny .
- Come and meet my friends .
- Oh , must I now ?
well , certainly . Dick , hold the piano a while . hold it .
please , everybody , come and meet my husband .
this is lieutenant commander John Morrison of the United States Navy .
he &apos;s just back from the South Pacific . Johnny , this is Charlie and Beverly .
- How do you do ?
- Rick and Carmen ...
Eddie !
Eddie !
- We were based at Quadulan .
- What were you flying , sir ?
- Liberators .
- Excuse me , Dick .
- Johnny , this is Eddie Harwood .
- I &apos;m glad to know you .
I &apos;ve heard a lot about you . I guess you &apos;ve had a rough time of it .
I &apos;m afraid my experiences are pretty dull .
I can &apos;t believe that . Hey , wouldn &apos;t you like a drink ?
not right now , thanks . I &apos;d like to get cleaned up a little .
Oh , take your things in there , Johnny .
excuse me .
- I think I better breeze .
- Why ?
pretty obvious why .
Oh , suppose there is . so what ? pardon me ...
well , if it ain &apos;t my beautiful man !
you and I are gonna have a little drink together right now .
Hey , where you going ?
- You &apos;ve got the wrong lipstick on , mister .
- Stop it !
you &apos;re entirely right .
sorry .
forget it .
ladies and gentlemen , I think you &apos;d better leave .
my husband would like to be alone with me . he probably wants to beat me up .
- Perhaps you want me to apologise .
- Apologise , darling ?
but you don &apos;t have to . you &apos;re a hero . a hero can get away with anything .
it seems I &apos;ve lost my manners .
or would anyone here know the difference ?
I don &apos;t care what she says . I think you &apos;re wonderful .
what are you doing ?
looking at this photograph of Dickey . I &apos;ve never seen it before .
- Why didn &apos;t you send me one ?
- I thought I had .
let &apos;s talk this out , Helen .
would you mind not drinking any more , just ...
Oh , for heaven &apos;s sakes , don &apos;t start preaching .
I take all the drinks I like , any time , any place .
I go where I want to with anybody I want .
I just happen to be that kind of a girl .
I &apos;d have thought Dickey &apos;s death would have made a little more difference .
we lived in a five-room house , and I did the laundry .
and I never went anywhere &apos; cause I had a kid to look after .
I don &apos;t have a kid to look after anymore .
and the people I go with now don &apos;t use a kiss as an excuse to sock each other .
keep on drinking that and you won &apos;t need an excuse .
really ?
you &apos;re not paying for my drinks .
well , why don &apos;t you answer it ?
you want to run everything else around here .
Hello ?
this is Johnny . Oh , hello , Buzz . you got the place , huh ?
Yeah . Yeah . where George lived before .
Yeah , there was 19 guys ahead of us , but they like George , here .
Oh , that &apos;s great , Buzz . Hey , what &apos;s your telephone number ?
Hillside 8-6-6-1 .
okay . Bye .
- The boys found an apartment .
- Yes ?
- I didn &apos;t know these things were ever blue .
- They &apos;re Eddie Harwood &apos;s calling cards .
he owns a night club on the strip called the Blue Dahlia .
Helen . let &apos;s try just once more .
I &apos;d love to . I &apos;m a girl that tries and tries .
well , suppose we begin by your not drinking anymore , huh ?
suppose we begin by you minding your own business ?
- I said you &apos;ve had enough !
- Take your paws off me !
maybe you &apos;ve learned to like hurting people .
I could tell you something about Dickey that would hurt you plenty !
what about Dickey ?
what about Dickey ?
- Noisy in here , aren &apos;t you ?
- So what ?
what do you call that , a prayer meeting ?
okay , Mr Morrison , just doing my job .
- Better close up . it &apos;s gonna rain .
- Okay .
maybe you &apos;d better pull the blinds down , too , if you &apos;re gonna push your wife around .
a call from the house detective . pretty , isn &apos;t it ?
now what about Dickey ?
- Forget it , Johnny . it was nothing ...
- What about Dickey ?
it was nothing , I tell you .
- Talk , tell me , will you ?
- Johnny , please .
it could happen to anybody . I &apos;d been to a party .
I had to take Dickey with me . I had a few drinks .
Oh , stop the tears !
all right , hero .
I was drunk . I was in a car smash .
Dickey was killed .
I wrote you he died of diphtheria because I was afraid to tell you the truth .
how do you like it ?
Johnny !
that &apos;s what I ought to do .
but you &apos;re not worth it .
line , please .
York 2-3-3-8 .
Mr Harwood , please . Mrs Morrison calling .
will you ask him to call me , please ?
Yeah ?
Johnny ?
Oh , oh , yeah , Mrs Morrison . George and me , we &apos;re Johnny &apos;s pals .
I know . that &apos;s why I &apos;m calling .
we had a quarrel . he walked out on me .
walked out on you ?
well , don &apos;t you worry about a thing .
George and me , we &apos;ll bring him back if we have to frogmarch him .
Yeah , sure , he &apos;ll come over here . Yeah , I &apos;ll call you as soon as he shows up .
that &apos;s all right . Bye .
George . Hey ...
that &apos;s right , he went out .
quiet in there .
quiet ! I got a sick baby !
- George .
- We eat eggs .
- Johnny &apos;s wife just called up .
- Yeah ?
- That &apos;s swell .
- No , it ain &apos;t swell .
he just walked out on her .
- Did you hear from him ?
- No , not yet .
he will come over here , though , won &apos;t he , George ?
not if I know him , he won &apos;t .
but I just told his wife we &apos;d bring him back . what are we gonna do ?
look , Buzz , there isn &apos;t anything we can do .
this is one problem Johnny &apos;s got to handle by himself .
- Yeah , but if he &apos;s not going to ...
- Forget it .
whatever &apos;s the right thing to do , Johnny &apos;ll do it .
we got to do something . we got to find Johnny .
Yeah , we &apos;ll talk about it afterwards . let &apos;s eat first . we got real eggs .
come on , crack &apos; em up , will you , while I get the rest of these things ready .
Buzz .
- Yes , sir ?
- Is Mrs Morrison in ?
- Who shall I say is calling ?
- Just say Buzz .
- Buzz . that &apos;s my name .
- Oh . 93 .
I &apos;m sorry , Mrs Morrison isn &apos;t in .
- Oh .
- Would you care to leave a message ?
- Well , you mind if I wait around ?
- Not at all . it &apos;s over there .
- Huh ?
- The bar .
Oh , thank you .
- Bourbon .
- In a minute .
didn &apos;t we meet at the Blue Dahlia the other night ?
I may have been there . we certainly didn &apos;t meet .
I &apos;m sure we have mutual friends ...
- Hey , you , that &apos;s my seat .
- Go pick yourself an orchid .
- Masterful type .
- All I want is a drink , and quick .
- Hey , how about that ?
- Take one of mine .
- Thanks .
- Mmm .
- Umm . Scotch .
- So they tell me .
I &apos;ll buy you a drink some rainy night .
it &apos;s raining now .
all right , I &apos;ll buy you a drink .
and no passes .
- Uh-huh .
- What &apos;s the matter , don &apos;t you believe me ?
Uh-huh .
- Okay , so I won &apos;t buy you a drink .
- Uh-huh .
- That &apos;s the end of that conversation .
- Wait a minute . you can buy me a drink .
only not in this joint . I &apos;ve had enough of it . come on .
- It &apos;s really coming down now .
- We haven &apos;t far to go .
look , you don &apos;t want to go out in that . why don &apos;t we go back to the bar ?
anyway , I came here to see somebody , and I ought to stick around till she gets here .
well , you can phone from my place and leave word where you are .
- You live here ?
- Sure . come on .
what &apos;s the matter ? scared ?
- You free ?
- Sorry , no pickups tonight .
- Good evening , Mr Harwood .
- Good evening , Melanie .
- It &apos;s kind of wet out , isn &apos;t it ?
- It certainly is .
Hello , Eddie . you &apos;re early .
- Evening , Leo . how &apos;s everything ?
- Took in seven grand last week .
that &apos;s fine .
- Have a drink ?
- No , thanks .
you &apos;re alone tonight , huh ?
good .
I was afraid that Morrison dame was getting to be a habit .
look , Leo , you run the Blue Dahlia , I &apos;ll take care of my private life .
we &apos;re hooked up together , Eddie . you get in a jam , I get in a jam .
you can forget Helen Morrison .
her husband &apos;s back from the South Pacific . let him take care of her .
Uh-huh .
if you think my wife left me because of another woman , it was something else entirely , Leo .
like how you make some of your dough ?
like your putting in with people like me ?
it &apos;s quite possible .
she was in the bar a little while ago . she just left .
gave me a message for you . she &apos;s going out of town for a few days .
save some money on flowers .
she could have told me that herself .
maybe she figured it would sound worse coming from me .
- Any cheques for me to sign ?
- Yeah , there &apos;s a few .
you , uh ...
you ever know a guy named Quinlan ?
- Never heard of him .
- Did a stretch somewhere back east .
not interested , huh ?
okay .
- Don &apos;t get cute with me , Leo .
- Nothing cute about it .
I heard this Quinlan spoke to you in the parking lot the other night .
when you were with Mrs Morrison . called you by some other name .
- Did he ?
- Not if you say he didn &apos;t .
but it doesn &apos;t matter now , anyway .
Quinlan was bumped off a few nights ago over on East 5th .
what makes you think I &apos;d be interested ?
just don &apos;t get too complicated , Eddie .
when a man gets too complicated , he &apos;s unhappy .
and when he &apos;s unhappy , his luck runs out .
Yeah ?
just a minute . she &apos;s calling you . the Morrison dame .
Hello , baby . I was just gonna call you .
well , it &apos;s about time . I &apos;ve been calling you all evening .
hold on a minute .
Hello ?
no , of course he &apos;s not here . no , he hasn &apos;t just stepped out .
he &apos;s gone . G-O-N-E . gone .
he &apos;ll be back all right , baby . it &apos;s all my fault .
I think he &apos;s a nice guy .
he was so far away , and I &apos;d never seen him .
I guess I didn &apos;t realise how it looked .
now wait a minute . I &apos;m not hinting . I &apos;m saying it straight out .
I think we better call it a day .
supposing I don &apos;t want to call it a day ?
two walkouts in one evening would be just a little too much for me , Eddie .
and if I don &apos;t want to call it a day , I &apos;m quite sure you won &apos;t for a very good reason .
I &apos;d better come over and talk to you , huh ?
say half an hour ? right .
I told you she was poison . they &apos;re all poison sooner or later .
almost all , anyway .
get in .
well , you could get wetter if you lay down in the gutter .
I wasn &apos;t trying to get wet .
you ought to have more sense than to take chances with strangers like this .
it &apos;s funny , but practically all the people I know were strangers when I met them .
I &apos;m going to Malibu . is that any use to you ?
- What &apos;s in Malibu ?
- Houses . people .
- I have some friends there .
- Any hotels ?
Motel , maybe .
pick up many people like this at night ?
not many . only one or two at a time .
you &apos;re right .
- Right ?
- That wasn &apos;t funny .
I &apos;m sorry , but nothing &apos;s very funny to me tonight .
it all blows up in your face sometimes , doesn &apos;t it ?
what does ?
whatever you &apos;re doing . wherever you &apos;re going .
- I thought you were going to Malibu ?
- I flipped a coin .
heads , I go to Malibu . Tails , I go to Laguna .
what happens if the coin rolls under the davenport ?
we go to Long Beach .
Oh , you can smile . I was beginning to wonder .
- Sure you won &apos;t have one ?
- No , thanks .
- My bag in your way ?
- No .
I was just wondering what the JM stood for .
- You don &apos;t have to wonder . I &apos;ll tell you .
- Well , that &apos;s no fun .
let me see . how about Jack Mason ?
that &apos;s fine for somebody named Jack Mason .
well , then , how about Jeremiah McGonigle ?
nobody was ever named Jeremiah McGonigle .
- Why ?
- I think I like Jeremiah McGonigle .
dull . no sense of humour .
well , that &apos;s two strikes on me .
- How about Jimmy Moore ?
- Jimmy Moore ?
- Is that really your name ?
- Don &apos;t you like it ?
I once knew a boy by the name of Jimmy . he had rabbit teeth .
I guess I &apos;ll learn to forget him , though . I was only eight years old then .
are you sure that coin you flipped came up heads ?
Yes . why ?
- That was Malibu we just passed .
- Was it ?
where have you been ?
- Out .
- Out where ?
- Guess I got lost .
- You guess ? don &apos;t you know ?
Yeah , I got lost .
- Where &apos;s Johnny ?
- Johnny hasn &apos;t been here .
Johnny ?
Buzz , are you all right ?
certainly I &apos;m all right . why wouldn &apos;t I be all right ?
what &apos;s the idea of running out without telling me ?
you &apos;ve been gone a couple of hours .
well , for Pete &apos;s sake , you might at least say something .
I &apos;m sleepy , George .
I &apos;d better telephone my friends or they &apos;ll think something &apos;s happened .
I won &apos;t be long .
Jimmy !
what &apos;s the idea ?
- It &apos;s the end of the line .
it has to be . it &apos;s a long way back to Malibu .
- What about you ?
- I &apos;ll make out .
and if I knew how , this is where I &apos;d say thanks for everything .
I didn &apos;t do it for thanks .
I know that .
well , don &apos;t you even say good night ?
it &apos;s good-bye . and it &apos;s tough to say good-bye .
why is it ?
you &apos;ve never seen me before tonight .
every guy &apos;s seen you before , somewhere . the trick is to find you .
and now , folks , bright and early on this beautiful sunny day , flowers are fresh from the rain , and there isn &apos;t a cloud in the sky .
bringing you once again your favourite breakfast programme ,
Melodies of the Morning .
well , well , well , unk-dray again .
couldn &apos;t make it to bed , huh ?
honey , I don &apos;t know where you put it .
come on , now , let &apos;s ...
Oh , brother .
Yeah ?
what &apos;s that ?
I &apos;ll be right over . and call Mr Hughes .
over there .
out . keep your mouth shut .
ever know me not to ?
- Looks like there was a brawl here .
- Yeah .
- Been dead for hours .
- Suicide ?
- Could be .
- Better be .
Uh-uh . too much gun .
now , don &apos;t start playing detective , Dad .
we &apos;ll have enough of that from the professionals .
- What &apos;s the number down there ?
- Don &apos;t you think we ought to
- look around a bit before we call the police ?
- Don &apos;t be a fool .
the sooner we get started , the sooner we &apos;ll get her out of here .
- What &apos;s the number ?
- Michigan 5-2-1-1 .
- Good morning .
- Good morning .
we will now continue with our morning music .
Helena !
I &apos;ll take a number three with orange juice .
remember me ?
- What happened to Malibu ?
- I guess it &apos;s where we left it .
- I stayed here at the inn .
- Why ?
- Do I have to have a reason ?
- It &apos;s nice after the rain , isn &apos;t it ?
- Uh-huh .
I didn &apos;t expect to see you again .
Jimmy , why don &apos;t you go back and fix it up before it &apos;s too late ?
maybe you &apos;d like it better if I &apos;d mind my own business .
you think you could ?
- I could try .
- It &apos;s my wife .
- Had an idea it might be .
- And there &apos;s nothing to fix up .
and if there was , I wouldn &apos;t want to fix it up anyway .
what about you ?
you weren &apos;t going to Malibu last night . you were trying to run out on yourself .
like me .
maybe you &apos;re right .
well , where do we go from here ?
we don &apos;t go anywhere . we said good-bye last night .
you catch the bus for up north , and I go back to Malibu .
that &apos;s right .
could we take a walk along the beach first ?
and look for moonstones ?
the tide &apos;s out .
we can even go wading , if you like .
if I run upstairs and change my shoes , will you be here when I get back ?
- Uh-huh .
- Not like last night ?
no .
the discovery occurred early this morning when neighbours ...
- Cheque , please .
- Yes , sir .
the cause of her death has so far not been definitely established .
- Los Angeles , all aboard .
- Sought for questioning is her husband ,
Lieutenant Commander John Morrison , recently returned from the South Pacific .
Lieutenant Commander Morrison is described as about 28 years old , weight 160 pounds , light brown hair , light brown or blue eyes .
when last seen he was wearing civilian clothes with a navy raincoat , and was carrying a civilian suitcase .
her lifeless body was found sprawled on a davenport in her exclusive Wilshire Boulevard hotel bungalow .
passengers for bus 382 leaving for Los Angeles . all aboard .
the discovery occurred early this morning when neighbours complained about the loud playing of the radio .
the cause of her death has so far not been definitely established .
- That &apos;s mine .
- Oh , no it ain &apos;t . wait a minute , now .
- Okay , okay . let &apos;s measure .
- All right .
- Anything for us ?
- Nope .
get your junk off this bench .
you fellows wait here .
- How do you like being pinched , George ?
- We &apos;re not pinched . relax .
what &apos;s the difference ?
they brought us here and we &apos;re here .
- What &apos;s your name , copper ?
- Save it .
maybe they don &apos;t have names . maybe they just have numbers .
calm down , can &apos;t you ?
how long do we have to wait here , copper ?
until the captain gets ready for you . and don &apos;t call me copper !
get that , George ?
he says don &apos;t call him copper .
pipe down .
is it all right if we smoke too , copper ?
- You want to make trouble ?
- Yeah , you want some ?
- Here .
- Hmm .
George ?
thanks , copper .
where &apos;s Captain Hendrickson &apos;s office , please ?
- Right there .
- Get this guy .
- Who is he ?
- Eddie Harwood . owns the Blue Dahlia .
- Hold it , Mr Harwood .
- Nothing doing , fellows . skip it .
Captain Hendrickson , please . I &apos;m Eddie Harwood .
- Just have a seat .
- Hello , Mr Harwood .
Hello , Dad .
- Okay .
- And Harwood &apos;s here , too .
good .
push the buzzer , will you , Cap ?
Captain Hendrickson &apos;s office , homicide bureau .
detective Lieutenant Lloyd speaking . call back , please .
shoot .
Captain Hendrickson &apos;s office , homicide bureau .
detective Lieutenant Lloyd speaking . call back , please .
okay , stand by .
who do you want first , Cap ?
Oh , let &apos;s take Harwood , pity to keep him waiting .
right .
come in , Mr Harwood .
I won &apos;t take up much of your time , Mr Harwood .
but I always like to meet the people involved in an investigation .
- Involved how ?
- Sit down .
you knew Mrs Morrison well , didn &apos;t you ?
fairly well .
how long have you known her ?
- You &apos;ve got all that .
- So I have .
slightly less than a year . met her through mutual friends .
correct .
she owned a business in Beverly Hills . you have any interest in that ?
I loaned her some money when she first bought it . the money &apos;s been repaid .
I see . purely a business transaction .
I &apos;d regard a secured loan at 6 % as a business transaction .
I suppose you think I &apos;m wasting your time ?
you &apos;re married , aren &apos;t you , Mr Harwood ?
my wife and I are separated . you want to know why ?
not unless it has a bearing on your relations with Mrs Morrison .
it hasn &apos;t .
- Where is Mrs Harwood at the moment ?
- No idea .
any idea where she was last night ?
no .
look here , Hendrickson , if you think my wife had anything to do with Helen Morrison &apos;s murder ...
so you &apos;re taking it for granted that Mrs Morrison was murdered , are you ?
- Well , wasn &apos;t she ?
- We haven &apos;t called it murder so far .
Yes , but the newspapers ...
well , then I just assumed it .
sure , but you &apos;re quite right . she was murdered .
we have the autopsy report now and nitrate tests of her hands .
well , thanks for coming in , Mr Harwood . I guess that &apos;s all for now .
am I under suspicion ?
I don &apos;t know . how do you feel about it ?
Hello , George ?
isn &apos;t George there ?
George Copeland .
no , George isn &apos;t here right now . who &apos;s this calling ?
who &apos;s calling , I said !
there &apos;s just one thing I &apos;d like you gentlemen to bear in mind .
even if you are close friends of Morrison &apos;s , you can &apos;t help him to hide out , so don &apos;t try .
I &apos;m an attorney , Captain . I understand perfectly .
I &apos;m glad to hear it .
if he gets in touch with you , make him come in .
- It &apos;s the only sensible thing for him to do .
- Baloney !
if you think we &apos;re gonna help you tie a murder to a guy who &apos;s flown us through 112 missions , you &apos;re off your nut !
we haven &apos;t accused Morrison of murder so far .
no , what &apos;s holding you up ?
have these men driven back to their apartment . bring in that Newell .
any chance for a room here ?
I &apos;m sorry , sir , we haven &apos;t had a vacancy in eight weeks .
do you know where I can find one ?
that &apos;s a pretty difficult thing to say these days .
- I &apos;m afraid I can &apos;t help you .
- All right , thanks .
you ! just a minute !
got a match ?
okay . use one of my own .
- Suitcase gets kind of heavy , don &apos;t it ?
- Yeah , what &apos;s it to you ?
every hotel in town &apos;s loaded . thought I might be a little help .
little place down on Santa Monica boulevard .
- What &apos;s the racket ?
- If you think it &apos;s a racket , call a cop .
- How far away is this place ?
- About six blocks .
transportation and everything . okay ?
okay .
you saw Harwood go up to this dame &apos;s apartment and knock on the door .
no answer . he went away . went away where ?
well , you see Captain , there &apos;s a side gate to the hotel grounds ...
we &apos;ve seen the joint .
well , that &apos;s where he went out . what time was this ?
- I &apos;ve told you gentlemen ...
- Tell us again .
it was about 7 : 00 . it was raining .
- You like standing in the rain ?
- I got to make my rounds .
see if everything &apos;s okay . nobody cutting up too much .
you got a passkey to the bungalows ?
- Surely you don &apos;t think I had ...
- Why not ?
plenty of genial old parties like you commit murders .
that isn &apos;t a very nice thing to say , Captain . Mrs Morrison &apos;s lights were on .
the radio was going . why would I want to get in ?
you tell us . she didn &apos;t answer when Harwood knocked .
- Didn &apos;t that interest you ?
- Would that be any of my business ?
you boys got a nice technique . had me worried for a minute .
no hard feelings , of course .
that &apos;s all , Newell , for now .
- This is a terrible thing for the hotel .
- Kind of tough on the Morrison dame , too .
go on , beat it !
you call this dump a hotel ?
that &apos;s what the sign said .
clean sheets every day , they tell me .
- How often do they change the fleas ?
- Hmm , very funny .
customer , Corelli .
that &apos;ll be 10 bucks .
in advance , Mr Moore .
- That &apos;ll be 10 for us , too .
- What ?
our commission . get it ?
- Give me back that money .
- You ain &apos;t going to get difficult , are you , pal ?
okay , boys , you win .
- Hot , ain &apos;t it ?
- Yeah .
Hi , Corelli .
anybody up here belong to that Plymouth down front ?
why ?
some crazy woman driver just tore a fender off it .
- I didn &apos;t hear nothing .
- No ?
what &apos;s a fender ?
forget it .
- Your car ?
- Could be .
come on down , then . we got to make a report .
let &apos;s skip it , huh ?
you heard what I said , didn &apos;t you ?
come on down . that &apos;s a hot car !
come on , get back here . come on get up , you .
come on , quick . turn around .
that &apos;s it . you want to play rough , huh ?
you boys make it easy for us .
all right , get going .
who are you ?
- Jimmy Moore , San Francisco .
- That right , Corelli ?
- Yeah , he just registered .
- Okay .
get moving .
thanks , pal .
- You still want that room ?
- If you &apos;re sure nobody &apos;s dead in it .
right back this way .
you live in San Francisco , Mr Moore ?
- Yeah , when I &apos;m there .
- Nice town .
I like it here better .
anything you need , just ask for it .
- Where &apos;s your phone ?
- Back down the hall .
Grenada Towers .
Mr Harwood , please .
good evening , Mr Harwood .
who let you in ?
Housemen don &apos;t have much trouble getting into places .
I come up the fire stairs .
thought it was a good idea not to be seen .
- Drink ?
- I don &apos;t mind if I do .
easy on the water .
I told the homicide boys a good straight story .
they &apos;re satisfied . for today , anyway .
but you know how these dicks are .
tomorrow they might get to figuring I was holding something back .
nice .
and were you holding something back ?
well , I hung around a while .
after you knocked on Mrs Morrison &apos;s door , I mean .
- Pretty wet , wasn &apos;t it ?
- Weather don &apos;t bother me .
used to be a copper myself . fifteen years of it .
sit down .
- How much do they pay you over there ?
- Twenty-eight a week and found .
- Not very much , is it ?
- No , it &apos;s not , for a fact . well , thanks .
so you thought you &apos;d like to make a little more . that &apos;s why you &apos;re here , huh ?
Oh , you got me all wrong , Mr Harwood . I just thought ...
Yeah , I know , I know .
- How old are you , Dad ?
- Going on 57 .
well , you &apos;ve got a lot of life left in you , unless you get careless .
I don &apos;t aim to get careless .
the cops don &apos;t pay you any money , and I do .
here .
gee , this sure is white of you , Mr Harwood .
Yes , isn &apos;t it ? finished your drink ?
no , I ...
well , I guess I better be going now , Mr Harwood .
wait a minute .
- You forgot your cigar .
- Oh , I ...
I think it &apos;s out .
cigars go out awful easy , don &apos;t they , Dad ?
good night .
Hello , Eddie .
Hello , baby . long time no see .
not so long , is it ?
you even send these blue flowers to yourself , don &apos;t you ?
- I thought you went out of town .
- I came back .
you still have this around . sentimentalist , aren &apos;t you ?
I only wish I had you with it .
sure , I know I &apos;ve got lots of faults , but being in love with you isn &apos;t one of them , is it ?
look , baby ...
it &apos;s too late , Eddie .
why ? why is it too late ?
just is .
Helen Morrison didn &apos;t mean anything to me alive .
no ?
and she doesn &apos;t mean anything to me dead .
she means something to the police , though .
the police have the whole story . my part of it , in any case .
- How do they like it ?
- As well as they ever like anything .
well , I guess everything &apos;s lovely , then .
who did kill her , Eddie ?
don &apos;t you read the papers ?
I don &apos;t have to believe everything I see in them .
well , if Morrison didn &apos;t kill her , he certainly set himself up pretty .
- The gun even had his initials on it .
- Careless of him .
I met him . he &apos;s the kind of guy who wouldn &apos;t care much what he did .
- When he walked in on that party ...
- He didn &apos;t like it .
how would you know ?
I know the kind of party it would be .
well , so long as I know you &apos;re all right , Eddie ?
so I do mean that much to you ?
I guess so .
take me to the mezzanine , please .
Yes , sir .
- Is Mr Harwood in ?
- I &apos;ll see .
- What name , please ?
- Moore .
Mr Harwood ?
give me the desk , please .
Mr Harwood &apos;s line is busy at the moment .
- What &apos;s his apartment number ?
- I &apos;m sorry . you &apos;ll have to be announced .
I &apos;ll try again in a moment .
desk .
who ?
just a minute .
for you , sir .
me ?
Hello .
please don &apos;t ask any questions . get out of the hotel right away .
Yeah , but why does it take so long ?
because when a man &apos;s in the service , they file his photo in Washington .
they have to get it from there .
what I &apos;m wondering is , who glommed the photo the maid said was in the bedroom ?
- If my name was Morrison , it would be me .
- Yeah .
the description we got could fit 1,000 guys .
Mr Harwood , please . Captain Hendrickson calling .
Yes , sir .
Mr Harwood .
anybody following us ?
I don &apos;t think so .
that &apos;s too bad .
do you want to get caught ?
when did you find out that somebody was trying to catch me ?
this morning when I saw you get rid of your coat .
are you angry at me for trying to help you , Jimmy ?
maybe you &apos;d better call me by my right name .
none of this would make any sense if you didn &apos;t know it .
all right , Johnny .
Johnny &apos;s quite a nice name , too .
but Jimmy didn &apos;t have the police after him .
it takes a lot of lights to make a city , doesn &apos;t it ?
I know you didn &apos;t kill your wife , Johnny .
- You do ? how ?
- Just from knowing you .
- You don &apos;t know me that well .
- Well enough .
you think you have to find out who did kill her , though , don &apos;t you ?
something like that .
I suppose you wonder why I don &apos;t let the police do that job .
have I acted as if I thought that ?
they &apos;re looking for me .
and if they catch me , they &apos;re not gonna worry about trying to pin it on somebody else .
- I &apos;ve thought of that , too .
- That isn &apos;t all .
even if we weren &apos;t happy , Helen was my wife .
and the man who killed her isn &apos;t gonna get away with it . he just thinks he is .
- You &apos;re talking about Eddie Harwood ?
- I didn &apos;t mention any names .
who else could it be ?
I wouldn &apos;t know . would you ?
- It seems you know more about it than I do .
things like picking me out of the air at a hotel desk .
you get around , don &apos;t you ?
and your timing &apos;s good .
it was good last night when you picked me up in the rain .
or was it ?
I don &apos;t know .
I don &apos;t know anything .
I don &apos;t even know your name .
Johnny , you &apos;ll have to trust me . I have something to settle , too .
- You &apos;ll have to trust me a lot .
I haven &apos;t got time to play games .
suppose you keep your secrets , and I &apos;ll keep mine , huh ?
okay , Johnny , if that &apos;s the way you feel about it .
coming ?
turn that radio down . turn it down , I tell you !
Hey , calm down , can &apos;t you ? other people have to live .
this headache I got don &apos;t calm down .
- Why don &apos;t Johnny call up or something ?
- Maybe he forgot the number .
maybe he doesn &apos;t want to take the chance . maybe he &apos;s not even in L.A .
that &apos;s three maybes . you &apos;re not stuck , are you ?
you know , I used to think of Johnny on the dodge like a cheap criminal .
he ought to go straight to Hendrickson and tell him his story .
sure , tell it to the cops . maybe you like cops .
well , I don &apos;t . I hate their guts .
and you better hope you never tell it to the cops , either .
what you need &apos;s a drink .
let me see . I seem to have misplaced your name at the moment .
where were you keeping it ?
but you &apos;re a friend of John Morrison &apos;s , aren &apos;t you ?
never heard of him .
come on in .
who are you ?
I work over at the Cavendish Court . Newell &apos;s the name . they call me Dad .
- You work at what ?
- Well ...
you &apos;re the house peeper , ain &apos;t you ?
Yeah , some folks call me that .
I don &apos;t suppose you gentlemen know where Mr Morrison is , do you ?
would we be likely to tell you ?
no , I suppose not .
would information about his movements be worth anything to you ?
depends on what the information is .
well , information ain &apos;t always so easy to get .
- Quit stalling . where did you see Johnny ?
- I haven &apos;t said I did see him so far .
- This guy &apos;s looking for a piece of change .
- You just think of that ?
well , as a matter of fact , it was a long walk over here .
why don &apos;t you call a couple of those cops you &apos;re so fond of ?
he &apos;s been cheating on their terms .
Oh , now wait a minute , gentlemen . you &apos;ve got me all wrong .
would that be possible ?
I happened to be going by Mr Harwood &apos;s hotel this evening ...
- Oh , you put the bite on Harwood , too , huh ?
- I resent that .
I saw Morrison go into the hotel and cross over to the desk .
- Then what ?
- I didn &apos;t have time to wait for any more .
he was standing at the desk when I left . I had to get to work .
- The guy really likes his work .
- And how .
- Where does Harwood live ?
- Grenada Towers on Wilshire .
- You know everything , don &apos;t you ?
- Oh , I get around .
- That all you &apos;ve got to tell us ?
- So far it is .
well , thanks .
nights , Mr Harwood usually goes to his club , the Blue Dahlia , if that &apos;s of any interest to you .
haven &apos;t I seen you before ?
- Before what ?
- Seems to me last night in the rain .
or , of course , I could be mistaken .
good night .
Mr Harwood , please . Mrs Harwood calling .
Eddie ?
Yes , it &apos;s me .
I &apos;ve changed my mind about something . do you want to take me out tonight ?
find what you wanted ?
you look good in a uniform . nice kid , too . yours ?
why didn &apos;t you tell me you was hot ?
I &apos;ve taken care of lots of hot boys .
all it takes is a little of that .
what makes you think I &apos;m hot ?
you ain &apos;t talking to one of them cheap heist guys , like them mugs that brought you here .
I &apos;ve been in this business a long time .
Jimmy Moore , huh ?
seems like I read somewhere , could have been the paper , about a guy named Johnny Morrison , the cops wanted to talk to on account his wife got croaked .
no comment , huh ?
suit yourself .
maybe I better keep this while you think things out .
Yes ?
Corelli ?
who &apos;s he ?
never mind . put him on .
you Leo ?
I run a joint over in Santa Monica .
a guy come in here tonight and registered as Jimmy Moore .
get the initials ?
JM .
he &apos;s a navy flier . that mean anything to you ?
is he there now ?
Oh , moved out on you ?
you don &apos;t seem to have much to sell , do you , Corelli ?
huh ?
sure , sure .
Yeah , I &apos;ll take care of you . so long , Corelli .
you &apos;re certainly a hard man to catch up with .
am I ?
nice to know you , Mr Moore .
- That is your name , isn &apos;t it ?
- You know my name and why I &apos;m here .
I don &apos;t , but you can tell me while I finish dressing .
if I were in your shoes , I &apos;d be 500 miles away . half the cops in L.A. are looking for you .
only half ?
all I have to do is pick up that telephone , you go out of here in handcuffs .
why don &apos;t you ?
I don &apos;t happen to be that kind of rat .
what kind of a rat are you ?
I &apos;m not a police informer , anyway .
neither am I .
so far .
whatever that means .
you rate yourself a pretty tough boy , don &apos;t you ?
tough enough to find out who killed my wife .
well , everybody seems to think you killed her .
not quite everybody .
I think you killed her .
don &apos;t be a dope .
just because I took Helen out a couple of times , and you put on that injured husband act .
what &apos;s a dope in your book ?
a guy without sense enough to get out while he can .
and hole up in some quiet place where people don &apos;t know you .
- Nobody knows me here .
- They soon will .
easy for you to call .
me ?
I &apos;d have to call long distance .
- I still don &apos;t get it .
- No ?
how long has it been since you were in New Jersey ?
I don &apos;t get that , either .
just why New Jersey ?
are you gonna answer the door , or let them break it down ?
- Hello , baby . get you a drink ?
- Oh , not now , thanks . I &apos;ll wait .
I &apos;ll just be a minute .
what made you change your mind ?
- You still have trouble with your bow tie .
- Oh , come ...
I &apos;m sorry . this is Mr Moore . Mr Moore , my wife .
how do you do , Mr Moore ?
I &apos;ll get my coat .
Oh , uh , fix yourself a drink .
well , why don &apos;t you say it ?
I might just as well have told you .
you would have read it in the papers tomorrow , anyway .
I didn &apos;t save myself much , did I ?
you don &apos;t owe me an explanation .
- I didn &apos;t want it this way .
- I &apos;ll bet you didn &apos;t .
Johnny , don &apos;t you realise you &apos;re in danger here ?
that isn &apos;t what worries me . I came here to do something .
but you fixed that , too .
- Johnny !
- So long , baby .
- Come on , George , will you hurry up ?
- Are you boys going somewhere ?
well , for crying out loud . come in here . Hey , George !
Johnny !
- Gee , am I glad to see you .
- What a heel you turned out to be .
where you been keeping yourself ?
well , I tried to call you , but some strange voice answered the phone .
that was the cops . they took us down for questioning . are you all right ?
depends on what you mean by all right . Hey , you got a drink ?
- You bet . you want it in a glass or a funnel .
- As usual .
bourbon straight with a bourbon chaser . coming up .
Oh ...
this is for me .
- You guys did all right for yourselves .
- Here you are . pour that into you .
what are you gonna do , Johnny ?
any ideas ?
it &apos;s pretty obvious . I haven &apos;t much choice .
you &apos;re not going to give yourself up to the cops ?
- Why not ?
- Johnny &apos;s right .
the longer he hides out , the tougher it &apos;ll be . and he can &apos;t hide out forever .
- Not if somebody rats on him , he can &apos;t .
- Meaning me , I suppose ?
Johnny , did that house peeper see you downstairs ?
house peeper ?
the one at the Cavendish Court , he was here just a while ago .
- He saw you go into Harwood &apos;s hotel .
- I wonder what he was doing there .
maybe there was a buck in it .
George , what do you think my chances are if I give myself up ?
with a record like yours and after what happened , no jury in the world would convict you .
we &apos;re not gonna take that chance , Johnny .
you and me are gonna scram out of here . the cops won &apos;t be looking for two guys .
Hey , wait a minute .
you boys think I killed her .
well , it doesn &apos;t make any difference what we think . legally , you ...
legally ?
you can skip the rest of it .
- Don &apos;t be a fool ... - Come on .
get out of the way .
Johnny , it don &apos;t matter to me what you &apos;ve done ...
let go of me .
Johnny , wait a minute .
well , I hope you &apos;re satisfied .
Morrison .
I guess you &apos;ve been expecting this , haven &apos;t you , Mr Morrison ?
how much dough did you give that house peeper ?
- Why ?
- All you bought yourself was a pinch .
take a look . they got him .
now , maybe we can do something .
Hey , this isn &apos;t the way to headquarters .
let me see that badge again .
this is a courtesy badge .
you got courtesy , didn &apos;t you ?
- Can you handle him alone ?
- Yeah .
hope I didn &apos;t hit him too hard . we might need him for bait .
hold it .
give it to him .
wise guy , huh ?
Mr Harwood , there are two men asking to see you .
- Any idea what they want ?
- I &apos;m sorry , they wouldn &apos;t tell me .
suppose they &apos;ll tell me ?
these night club monkeys do all right for themselves , don &apos;t they , George ?
looks like there &apos;s a living in it .
- You wish to see me ?
- We &apos;re friends of Johnny Morrison &apos;s .
- Well ?
- You &apos;ve heard of him , haven &apos;t you ?
come into my office .
- Have a seat .
- We &apos;ll stand up .
what &apos;s on your mind ?
about half an hour ago , Johnny was picked up outside our apartment by a couple of plainclothesmen .
well , that &apos;s the best thing that could &apos;ve happened to him , isn &apos;t it ?
that &apos;s what we thought half an hour ago .
only they didn &apos;t happen to be plainclothesmen .
we checked at headquarters .
and are you surprised ?
maybe you ought to tell me what you &apos;re talking about .
here &apos;s a guy you really got to draw a picture for , George .
take it easy .
take it easy . that &apos;s all you do . take it easy .
what did it get Johnny ?
maybe you could answer that , funny face .
before you answer that , get this through your head .
if anything happens to Johnny , you &apos;re looking at a couple of guys who &apos;ll spend a lot of time taking care of whoever did it .
- I &apos;ll remember that , if it seems important .
- We &apos;ll take care of that , too .
Hello ?
- Captain Hendrickson ?
put him on .
- These guys are full of nifties , George .
Yeah . just a minute .
Yes , Captain ?
we &apos;ve dug up a little more information .
something we &apos;re rather anxious to talk to you about , if you can spare the time .
I &apos;ll be right down , Captain . I &apos;m leaving now .
- Okay ?
- We &apos;ll wait till you get back .
make yourselves at home .
- Look at that thing .
- Yeah , that &apos;s really something , ain &apos;t it ?
- You think you busted it ?
- Could be .
- The table hit it plenty hard enough .
- Here , you can put it in here .
- I put some salt in . it might help .
- Ouch , that &apos;s hot !
that does feel good .
better tie him up , just in case .
- Give me another drink , will you ?
- Yeah .
how much dough was in the billfold ?
- What billfold ?
- Pretty good fountain pen , too , huh ?
- Huh ?
- What else did you get ?
- Nothing .
- Come on , hand it over .
okay .
there &apos;s ethics in this business the same as any other .
excuse me . I thought my husband was in here .
Hmm , give a look . Harwood &apos;s babe . I bet she cost plenty , huh , George ?
how much would it cost to get you to button your lip just once ?
I &apos;m sorry . Mr Harwood went out .
you &apos;re George and Buzz , aren &apos;t you ?
- Female detective .
- Johnny told me about you .
- Why would he tell you anything ?
- It just so happens I &apos;m a friend of his , too .
since when ?
we only hit town yesterday .
how long does it take to become a friend of Johnny Morrison &apos;s ?
Oh , excuse me . Captain Hendrickson &apos;s on the phone asking for Mr Harwood .
what shall I tell him ?
tell him to soak his head . get out of here and close that door .
if I got to listen to any more of that monkey music , I &apos;ll ...
Mr Harwood &apos;s on his way to the Captain &apos;s office .
- Just tell him he &apos;s left , Paul .
- Yes , madam .
it &apos;s a shell fragment right above the ear .
it kept playing over and over and over again .
like it was the only record they had . it was in one of those ritzy bungalows .
Buzz , what are you talking about ?
I don &apos;t know .
what are you doing that for ?
- Doing what ?
- Picking at that flower .
I don &apos;t like it .
say , that &apos;s funny .
that &apos;s the same monkey music they kept playing in the apartment next door .
all day long , beating in my head .
you &apos;ve got to pull yourself together , fellow .
it wasn &apos;t next door , either . it was someplace else .
the music was right in the same room with us , and she kept picking at that flower .
just like you were doing . only she wouldn &apos;t stop .
she kept right on doing it .
Ow !
Hello , this is Mr Harwood . is Paul there ?
what ?
give me that again , slow .
okay , tell him to relax .
I &apos;ll be right back .
still playing the hotshot , huh ?
don &apos;t look so disappointed . the boys did their best .
Mr Bauer .
would you mind telling me how you found out ?
recognise that photograph on the floor ?
well , read what &apos;s on the back of it .
that would be Helen .
she wasn &apos;t a girl to throw away this kind of information .
why didn &apos;t you make sure of that before you killed her ?
in a hotel bungalow ? with a .45 ?
I could &apos;ve arranged things better than that .
like you arranged this ?
this could &apos;ve stood a little more polish , too .
just a cigarette .
maybe you &apos;re right at that .
I &apos;m not much of a hotshot after all .
such a nice clean start I had , too .
helping another wild kid shoot a bank messenger back in Passaic .
and for free . didn &apos;t have a dime on him .
and I spent the next 15 years trying to kid myself it never happened .
I get to own a war plant , a night club .
I even marry a girl .
a girl who oughtn &apos;t to have given me the time of the day .
this is how I end up .
what makes it even worse is the cops aren &apos;t interested in either of us anymore .
they &apos;ve already got their killer .
when ?
they caught up with him at the Blue Dahlia a little while ago .
one of your buddies . he just confessed .
what are you trying to give me ?
there &apos;s the phone .
all right , repeat that .
&quot; Newell :
okay , so she did give me a little dough
&quot; once in a while to keep my mouth shut .
what &apos;s so wrong with that ? &quot;
- That &apos;s the last I got .
- Newell , come here .
are you positive this is the man you saw go into the bungalow with Mrs Morrison ?
I told you I did , didn &apos;t I ? ain &apos;t that enough ?
- It &apos;s our business to know what &apos;s enough .
- Take it easy .
now , let &apos;s get back to this shot you heard .
seeing you finally made your mind up to tell us about it .
Oh , now , wait a minute , Captain Hendrickson .
I ain &apos;t trying to hold anything back .
it might have been backfire . it ain &apos;t always so easy to tell .
- What time was it ?
- Near as I can figure , about 7 : 50 .
and what time did you say this man got home ?
I didn &apos;t say . I didn &apos;t even say he went out .
quit trying to cover up for me , George . give them what they want .
what for ?
to back up the evidence of a cheap blackmailer ?
- Hey , just a minute .
- Shut up and sit down .
over there !
come on , son .
you just about told us you killed her . why not give us the rest of it ?
why do you have to keep pounding at him ?
what more do you want him to say ?
it &apos;s got to make sense to us , too , Mrs Harwood .
you didn &apos;t go there to kill her . you &apos;d never even seen her before .
what did she do that got you going ?
the things she said . what she was .
what she did to Johnny . she didn &apos;t even care .
all she did was pick at that flower .
and the gun lying right there in the chair , asking you to use it .
my head hurts .
- I don &apos;t remember so good .
- Sure you remember .
it &apos;s Johnny &apos;s wife we &apos;re talking about . you remember Johnny &apos;s wife , all right .
Johnny .
Johnny . George . George , where &apos;s Johnny ?
why ain &apos;t Johnny here ?
he &apos;d know I wouldn &apos;t mean to do a thing like that .
no ? why wouldn &apos;t you ?
all you had to do was grab hold of the gun , jab it against her heart and squeeze the trigger .
that &apos;s the way it was , wasn &apos;t it ?
come on , give out !
don &apos;t try to dummy up on us .
that &apos;s the way it was , wasn &apos;t it ?
- Sounds like you said it all .
- Johnny !
Hello , Mr Morrison . about time we got together .
nobody &apos;s gonna get hurt with this , except maybe me . Buzz .
okay , Buzz , light it .
Johnny , you &apos;re crazy .
- Let him alone , give him back that gun .
- He can &apos;t do it anymore .
he can do it with his eyes shut . on your feet , Buzz .
on your feet , I said .
now give him back that gun .
all right , fella , light it up .
okay , skipper .
I did it !
- I did it , didn &apos;t I , Johnny ?
- Sure you did .
jab it against her heart , huh ?
still buying that ?
I have to . that &apos;s how she was killed .
- What says he killed her ?
- It was his own idea .
- Who sold him the idea ?
- I did .
- It would be me , wouldn &apos;t it ?
- Would you mind telling me how ?
he got terribly upset when I began to pull the petals from this flower .
this is beginning to make sense . he must have seen Helen do that , too .
it was my gun . Helen and I were quarrelling .
we were loud .
you knew that . you heard us .
or didn &apos;t you tell them about coming through that door ?
sure I did . kind of had to , didn &apos;t I , Mr Morrison ?
well , you got a fall guy standing right in front of you . what more do you want ?
I just happen to be dumb enough to want to get the right fall guy .
when your wife was killed , you were 50 miles north of here .
lets you out , doesn &apos;t it ?
lets Mrs Harwood out , too . makes things a little tough for us , doesn &apos;t it ?
Yeah , you &apos;re right out on a limb . so all you &apos;ve got left is to pick on him .
- We &apos;ve still got Harwood , if we can find him .
- Well , you can count Harwood out .
that &apos;s interesting .
if you know where Leo &apos;s ranch is , maybe you better go take a look .
think you can arrange that ?
any further details ?
look , Captain , I &apos;m not trying to run your business .
you &apos;re doing fine . I &apos;m not proud .
you were swell in there a minute ago , Buzz .
still got that old circus shot , ain &apos;t I , Johnny , huh ?
sure you have , but you got to have a lot more .
come on , tell me the part that counts .
- Counts ? the part ...
- Yeah , come on , come on .
that &apos;s what they keep saying . I hit that match just like I used to , didn &apos;t I , Johnny , huh ?
he can &apos;t remember , Johnny . he just doesn &apos;t know .
well ...
what &apos;s the matter with me , Johnny ?
there &apos;s nothing wrong with you , Buzz . you just got to think .
you got to remember , that &apos;s all . all right now , for me . for me .
what happened in the bungalow ?
come on , come on . that &apos;s right .
Yeah , it was a bungalow , Johnny . Yeah , and she ...
come on .
she kept picking at that flower , Johnny . just ...
just like that one over there .
- Yeah .
- She ...
and it was raining , and I ...
- Come on , what happened , Buzz ?
- Come on .
my head ...
the music was beating , Johnny . beating .
beating , beating , beating , beating , beating !
music in my head , Johnny .
is there a radio here ?
Johnny , you don &apos;t think I did it , do you , Johnny ?
is there a radio here ?
- Just the speaker from the dance floor .
- Turn it on .
that monkey music again . that monkey music .
okay , she did buy me a drink .
what &apos;s wrong with that ?
I didn &apos;t even know who she was until she started talking about Johnny .
will you cut that music out ?
go on with the rest of it , Buzz . why did you kill her ?
who says I killed her ? you can &apos;t hand me that stuff .
not even you . I wouldn &apos;t dirty my hands on her .
all right , turn it off .
I didn &apos;t mean that , Johnny .
I just had to get out of there . I couldn &apos;t take it anymore .
she called me back , but I just kept right on going .
and I don &apos;t know where . I guess I must have gone home .
that &apos;s where I went , wasn &apos;t it , George ?
he was wet enough to have walked all the way .
he got home three minutes past eight . are you satisfied ?
you could have told us that a long time ago .
I guess you know why I didn &apos;t . I wasn &apos;t sure enough when that shot was fired .
are you sure now ?
you &apos;ve got a witness , haven &apos;t you ?
a witness you yourself called a cheap blackmailer .
now just a minute . I could be called that once too often .
you be sure to tell us when to duck .
what makes you so top-heavy all of a sudden ?
for all anybody here knows , you could have killed Mrs Morrison yourself .
except that you fixed the time .
well , maybe I kind of made a mistake there . five or 10 minutes either way .
be hard to tell . I was kind of busy keeping the rain off my neck .
I ain &apos;t the wristwatch type , you know .
that umbrella of yours must &apos;ve got pretty wet last night .
that &apos;s what I bought it for .
you ought to have left it on the porch , instead of letting it drip all over Mrs Morrison &apos;s carpet .
- I did leave it on the porch . that is , I ...
- All right .
might as well wrap it up for tonight . we don &apos;t seem to be getting anyplace .
we &apos;ll want signed statements from all of you , but tomorrow will be time enough .
Yeah , I got to get back to the job myself .
well , good night , all . no hard feelings , I hope .
Oh , Captain , I wish you &apos;d put in a good word for me with the hotel manager .
he &apos;s kind of sore at me .
surely not for blackmailing the guests .
all right .
you don &apos;t really think you &apos;re going out that door , do you ?
what &apos;re you getting at ?
how much did you up the ante on her when her husband came home ?
what did she threaten to do ?
get you fired ?
or was she going to have Harwood &apos;s friends give you the treatment ?
maybe she was going to blow a hole in you herself .
only she wouldn &apos;t know how to handle that kind of a gun .
all you had to do was grab it out of her hand .
I guess even a very cheap blackmailer could do that .
cheap , huh ?
sure , a cigar and a drink and a couple of dirty bucks .
that &apos;s all it cost to buy me . that &apos;s what she thought .
found out a little different , didn &apos;t she ?
maybe I could get tired of being pushed around by cops and hotel managers and ritzy dames in bungalows .
maybe I could cost a little something , just for once .
and if I do end up on a slab ...
boy , am I sunk .
- And that was one of the easy ones .
- We must be getting old .
I felt kind of sorry for the old gent at that .
- Thanks , Bill .
- You &apos;re welcome , Mrs Harwood . good night .
we seem to be saying good-bye again .
it won &apos;t be so difficult this time , I guess .
last night when I made myself walk out on you , remember ?
I said every guy had seen you before . somewhere .
- I remember .
- But the trick was to find you .
I remember that , too . do you think I &apos;d ever forget it ?
let &apos;s go find someplace where we can get a drink , huh ?
- We got to wait for Johnny .
- We got to wait for Johnny ?
what do you think I am ?
a camel ? come on .
- Good morning , Lieutenant .
- Good morning , Templar .
they are all here . how would you want them ?
give me the woman that reported it first .
- Her husband is with her .
- Alright both of them .
you and your husband .
the name of the victim ?
Dr. Frank Peralta .
Frank Peralta .
all right , what happen ?
when I arrived this morning at 7.30
there he was , just lying there .
you live at the same address ?
that &apos;s right , the same floor .
- You saw him last night ?
- Around 10 o &apos;clock .
he was coming home . I was going out .
- He was alone ?
- No , he had a young lady with him .
- You know the young lady ?
- Never saw her . very pretty .
what was she wearing ?
a blue suit , and flowers in her hair .
- Gloves ?
- I do not think so .
- I guess they were going home ?
- That &apos;s what I assumed .
- And that was at 10 o &apos;clock ?
- Around 10 .
you think you know her if you saw her again ?
I think so . we met face to face .
I see .
what do you know about her ?
I live in the apartment under doctor Peralta .
about 10 : 35 last night I heard this thud .
- How do you know the time ?
- I had just turned on the 10 : 30 news .
I heard footsteps on the stairs outside .
I opened my door a bit . I was curiosity .
I &apos;m glad you were . what did you see ?
a young woman very pretty passed me and went out .
from doctor Peraltas apartment ?
I suppose so .
but you didn &apos;t see her come out of his door ?
I &apos;m not sure . I don &apos;t think so .
do you think you would recognize her ?
Yes , I &apos;m sure .
I got a good look at her . she passed under the light .
I see .
you &apos;re his secretary ?
I was ...
want do you know of his plan for last night ?
he had an engagement for diner with a girl called Teresa Collins .
you don &apos;t like her ?
I know very little about her .
but I couldn &apos;t believe that Dr. Peralta was in love with her .
you mean he thought he was ?
sometimes he did , sometimes he didn &apos;t .
but she treated him badly , she kept him in such a state .
he was going to propose to her last night .
Teresa Collins ?
you know where she lives ?
I can tell you where she works .
she runs a magazine stand in the Medical Building .
where Dr. Peralta office are - were .
Mrs. Didriksen , you first . see if you recognize anyone .
keep your mind on what you &apos;re doing .
you go out with me and I buy you a steak .
good enough for me .
- I ain &apos;t kidding .
- Neither am I .
when I get out of this monkey suit I ain &apos;t a bad looking guy .
you go , Benson .
the girl all right . behind the counter .
- Are you sure ?
- Pretty sure .
won &apos;t you swear to it ?
I think so .
still , there is something ...
Yes , I swear to it .
I hope you &apos;ll remember that .
- Don &apos;t you remember me ?
- Sure if you want me to .
I remember you all right .
- Where did she go ?
- How do I know . so ?
that &apos;s the girl all right .
- You would swear to it ?
- Yeah . on a stack of Bibles .
thanks . we &apos;ll get in touch later .
it looks pretty good .
Miss Collins ?
I &apos;m from the Police .
- I beg your pardon .
- Good morning , Doctor .
can you show me something in the line of lemon drops .
- How about lemon drops ?
- Very good idea !
I do not know how to thank you .
would you mind to tell me how you spent last night ?
- Why ?
- You mind ?
- No , but ...
- From 8 o &apos;clock on .
- What it &apos;s all about ?
- Begin it at 9 .
will you tell me then ?
all right . I went for a walk Jefferson Park .
- Alone ?
- Yes .
how long ?
I came home around 11 : 30 .
for nearly three hours you walked alone in the park ?
not exactly . for two hours I was listening to a band concert
a then I strolled by the lake and sat listening to the water .
then I got chilly , and went home .
- Didn &apos;t you met anyone you knew ?
- I didn &apos;t say that .
anyone that knows you , I should say .
my butcher and his wife were at the concert .
- What is the name there ?
- Peterson , 14th street .
- You &apos;d speak with him ?
- Sure , we old friends !
I can check , remember .
all right , check .
anyone else ?
the park policeman down by the lake . we talked for a while .
do you know his name and number ?
but we know each other . we &apos;ve talked there before .
- Is he a sweetheart ?
- Not till I get his name anyway .
the truth is ...
and a boy Nat de Grott walked me home with me .
where do I find him ?
he works at the supermarket of 15th Street .
and he actually walked home with you ?
go ask him , if you don &apos;t believe me .
- I intent to .
- What is this all about ?
Dr. Peralta was murdered last night .
murdered ?
stabbed in the heart .
Terry !
break it up .
what do you want ?
Hello , Franklin ?
she &apos;s all right now .
a little shaky . but okay the doctor says .
okay , let her go .
are you kidding ?
of course I &apos;m not kidding . it &apos;s a free country .
you mean the two witnesses that saw her smack at the place ?
against three that saw her smack away from it .
7 km away !
I saw them . three solid taxpaying , God fearing citizens , that knows her and talked to her all over Jefferson Park last night .
from 9 o &apos;clock to 11 : 35 p.m .
- What do you know about that ?
- I don &apos;t get it .
it makes no more sense to me than Chinese music .
second floor , Lieutenant .
can I come ?
certainly .
- How do you feel now ?
- All right , thank you .
it sticks ...
the alibi .
of course , it &apos;s the truth .
that butcher now , he couldn &apos;t be in love with you .
I don &apos;t think so either .
- Guys generally falls in love with you ?
- Some .
Peralta ?
he was a dear friend ... very dear .
why did you quarrel with him ?
the elevator boy heard you .
it wasn &apos;t a quarrel Rusty never liked him . jealous ?
you think Rusty might have killed him ?
- Why ?
- He was in love with you to , right ?
for a policeman , you certainly spent a lot of time thinking about love .
I &apos;m the romantic type .
you &apos;re left-handed ?
is this visit social or professional ?
you gave the doctor the lemon drops with your right hand .
I was born left handed .
must thing I do right handed . I didn &apos;t liked being left handed .
the killer was right-handed .
- What am I supposed to say to that ?
- I &apos;m just waiting and see .
- If you don &apos;t mind ...
- We &apos;ll break the alibi .
it might take time , but ...
I like you to leave .
I &apos;d like go to bed .
you and ...
so that &apos;s it !
my sister ...
Ruth .
why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
excuse me .
I was going to when the time came .
- Everybody knows it .
- Not at the Medical Building .
no .
that was so we could take days of if we wanted to .
you make a habit of that monkey business ?
all twins do now and again .
so you &apos;re Terry ... and you , Ruth .
- It relieves me ! - That &apos;s nice .
I thought I was losing me marbles .
people often confuse us .
so I see . which one was at the park last night ?
- One of us .
- That I know .
which one is what I asked .
you ... or you ?
I know you &apos;re stalling because I will get it out you one way or another .
how ?
you don &apos;t want to make it any tougher than it is .
so let &apos;s have it :
which did which last night ?
one was in Jefferson Park . the other went to bed early .
but how can that one prove that ?
and that &apos;s all we got to say .
were you in Jefferson Park ?
are you going to answer me or not .
I &apos;m not !
you &apos;ll only making trouble for yourselves . it &apos;ll be harder in the end .
because you can &apos;t get away with it .
will you cut this nonsense out and be sensible ?
a man was murdered .
I give you one more chance . let &apos;s see if we can get somewhere .
which one stayed here last night ?
one of us went to Jefferson Park . the other ...
but what one do which ?
which one did which ?
I &apos;ll just have to run you both in .
are you aloud to play the field like that ?
what ?
can you throw a number of people in the court and tell the judge to take his pick .
no lawyer would take you seriously .
what lawyer ?
the one that will come to the police station if we are not here to answer the phone tonight .
- You &apos;re smart , aren &apos;t you .
- Not dump .
do you know about obstructing justice ?
don &apos;t you like to reconsider ?
me ... ?
or her ... ?
will you tell me one thing ?
one of us ...
will you cut that out !
- Is there no way to tell you apart ?
- We are identical .
it &apos;s all right dear , he is not going to do anything .
- You think so ?
- No I don &apos;t .
I know what our rights are , and so will a judge .
and one of them is the Constitution right not to say anything that might incriminate us .
constitutional rights , she says !
and will you please leave ? or do you want me to call our lawyer ?
I am a policeman , not a lawyer .
you won this round .
so don &apos;t try to duck out . we &apos;ll unravel this thing yet
no scheme never obstructed justice . and it is not going to start with this one .
then bring a warrant next time with the name already written in .
did you read up on this before you did it ?
never mind . I don &apos;t want to hear it .
I forgot to tell you .
it &apos;s to twins . did you get that ?
- I got that .
- Looking very much alike , the fellow told me .
- People can &apos;t even tell them apart , he said .
- Can &apos;t they really ?
that &apos;s the way twins are .
thank you , I can see you got you eyes open .
I try to keep on my toes as much as possible , Lieutenant .
rest assured that we appreciate it . good night .
good night , Lieutenant .
it &apos;s no use . there isn &apos;t even a piece of print on the handle .
- Gloves ?
- Could be .
there should be a law against selling gloves to murders .
- You know what they do in the good days ?
- Ladies bruise too easy .
get me Judge Hill .
you know , I was thinking .
maybe one of these babies got a birthmark somewhere .
it might be a good idea that I made a kind of thoroughly examination of both of them ...
just an idea ...
well , no more fun .
here is the list of witnesses . have them here at 9am tomorrow .
- Got it ?
- Got it .
judge Hill ...
Stevenson , DB
I want a couple of warrants for Ruth and Teresa Collins .
that &apos;s right .
charge :
suspicion of murder .
Yes , both .
what ?
I &apos;m gonna hang numbers on there backs like football players .
all right , bring her in .
where do you live ?
492 , Kendale Avenue .
have you been arrested before ?
turn around .
that &apos;s it . no doubt .
bring it .
I &apos;d know her in a million I ...
- Teresa Collins ? - Right .
you two girls are held in suspicion of murder .
what do you got to say for yourselves ?
neither one of us care to say anything until we &apos;ve talk to a lawyer .
well , how do you like that !
know her in a million , eh ?
what do you think ?
no idea , Rusty . it &apos;s hard to believe she could have done it .
I know she didn &apos;t . those guys are crazy .
take a lemon drop , it calms the nerves .
sent them in .
will you go in , please .
they are not gonna make me say one word against her .
I know her too well ...
we &apos;re sorry .
Dr. Elliott , Mr. Judge .
- Thanks very much for coming .
- Not at all .
I don &apos;t think this is going to take us very long , Mr. Rusty .
you told that you saw Dr. Peralta and the girl arguing on the morning of the day Peralta were killed .
- That &apos;s right ?
- Yes , Lieutenant .
can you tell me which one ?
- No , Lieutenant .
- You are sure ?
I did not know that there were two of them .
quite a coincident , doctor .
quite .
&quot; Scott Elliott , psychologist , Ph.d. , author of :
&quot; twins , a Clinical Study , Mental traits of identical twins ;
&quot; twins and siblings , &quot;
&quot; all published by the faculty . &quot;
your own field .
I have spent quite some time in the studying the subject .
did you know they were twins ?
no .
one at the time twins looks likes singletons .
is there any foundation of the old popular belief that the twins are usually penalized by nature , either physically or mentally
it &apos;s a superstition .
that clears that up .
you had a conversation with Peralta that morning .
would you mind repeating it ?
he asked me if I had ever come across a split personality .
go on .
I told him I had .
then he asked if there where any danger in such a case .
he used the word &apos; danger &apos; ?
Yes ...
or if I thought all that kind of thing was exaggerated .
- To which you replied ?
- I told him I couldn &apos;t say .
I couldn &apos;t answer with generality , when he obviously had a specific in mind .
and then he said something :
&quot; I had a battle with her this morning and I &apos;m seeing her tonight &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s rather important . &quot; and we separated .
seeing whom tonight ?
- Miss Collins , I suppose .
- Which one ?
I have no idea .
can you tell me which girl was behind the counter that morning ?
that &apos;s all . thank you for helping us out here this morning .
take the girls outside .
you see ?
- You are going to let them get away with it ?
- What can I do ?
you haven &apos;t a witness that can tell one girl from the other .
I wouldn &apos;t have a chance in court .
any lawyer could make a monkey out of me with set up like that .
we couldn &apos;t even get it pass the grant jury .
- But one of them murdered him .
- I &apos;m sure of that ?
I &apos;m just as concerned as you , but in this case we are helpless .
with no more evidence , a trial would a waste of time .
let &apos;s have them back .
come in .
one of you is a murderer who killed someone in cold blood .
the other is an accomplice .
the law uphold your refusal to give any testimony .
it also forbid the indiscriminate prosecution of more than one person in order to make sure for one guilty one .
this protection now enables you to become parties to an outrageous and miscarriage of justice
I cannot express my contempt .
now get out !
we are free ?
you &apos;re free .
Goodbye , Lieutenant .
Au revoir , Miss Collins .
remember me ?
of course Lieutenant . come on in .
sorry !
I don &apos;t mind ordinary music , it &apos;s the wonderful stuff that bores me .
that &apos;s snobbish .
this is an ordinarily place , where is the gimmicks ?
don &apos;t you witchdoctors treat people with tinker toys ?
they are in my laboratory at the university .
what about the office in the Medical Building ?
just a convenient place to get case history . I don &apos;t practice really .
lemon drop ?
have you given any thought to this twin case ?
I supposed you &apos;ve given that one up .
not me personally .
this is on my own time .
you don &apos;t look ambitious .
it &apos;s not ambitious I don &apos;t like a perfect crime .
I cannot accept that which mocks justice .
Yes , I thought about it .
I like them ... or one of them anyway .
you don &apos;t know which one ?
no I &apos;m afraid not . I never had a talk with them together .
- You think you &apos;d know if you did ?
- I imagine so .
you couldn &apos;t tell that day in the D.A. &apos; s office ?
- This whole thing burns me to a crisp .
- How do you know someone else didn &apos;t do it
I don &apos;t . and in the meantime I play along with the twins .
do you realize that one of the girls could knock the guy off with 50 witnesses and we still couldn &apos;t hang it on her ?
I guess not .
I could be in that room and see her stab the guy and I couldn &apos;t make it stick unless I graped her and hold on to her .
I can &apos;t bear it . I can &apos;t bear it .
first , tell me this ...
you &apos;re a twin expert . do you know anything about those to dames that could give me a chance to begin work ?
- Sure .
- What ?
the crime .
you don &apos;t suppose anyone could commit a murder , do you ?
you must be patient with me . what do you mean ?
the character , personality , nature can &apos;t duplicate personality , not even in twins .
once I interviewed a pair of twins so a like that even dogs got confused .
once living a thousand mile apart they both got toothache in the same tooth .
do you know why they lived so far apart ?
because one was lecturing at a big university , the other was in prison .
different characters .
I see . it &apos;s the same here .
one could and one couldn &apos;t commit murder .
that &apos;s all there is to it .
Yeah . that &apos;s all there is to it !
constitutional rights !
another thing :
do you often interview twins ?
often . but not for the police .
- What about the one you like ?
- What about her ?
suppose she is innocent ...
there is no reason to think she is any danger .
living with a killer ?
it &apos;s not really my business that kind of thing .
if one of them killed , don &apos;t you think there &apos;s a chance she &apos;ll kill again ?
her sister if she ever became nervous about her ?
- No doubt about it .
- I &apos;ll never ask you the name .
I swear it .
one day you call me and say you &apos;ve got the answer , and I &apos;d be satisfied .
then I &apos;ll know that there are no such thing as a perfect crime .
the system works . you can &apos;t beat it .
- Social regularity ?
- That &apos;s your name for it .
it &apos;s out of question .
I am not a detective and I doubt I can help you .
besides I never said I was in love with the girl .
I like her ... ?
how do I know it wasn &apos;t her ?
you can &apos;t just look at a person and know that .
she could have been killing people for years .
all I said is that she was very pleasant ...
it &apos;s not easy to believe that ...
Mr. Lemon Drops !
Terry , of course !
how are you ?
still champing candy !
I told you before I don &apos;t chump .
- No wonder I never got it !
- Didn &apos;t you ?
an expert like you .
no . obviously you are both wonderful .
I almost forget that there was such a thing as kidding .
- Things hasn &apos;t been so good ?
- Not so good .
you saw paper . those picture . we are celebrities &apos; now .
- No work ?
- One look at our face and ...
- They don &apos;t forget . not in this town .
- It &apos;s not very nice .
you can &apos;t blame them . you heard what the judge said .
I wish you wouldn &apos;t say things like that .
but he knows . he must have read the papers .
I know but ...
then maybe my idea , that &apos;s the real reason why I &apos;m here , maybe of some good to you as well as me .
how do you mean ?
I &apos;d like to add you two in my collection of twins .
I &apos;m an old twin student , remember .
and I like to add you girls to it .
I &apos;d pay you . of course not much .
it should only be an hour each day .
we did that once when we were kids in Chicago .
then you know what it is . physical , verbal , psychologically standard stuff .
are you quit sure you &apos;re not doing this for the police ?
I was gathering data on twins before I ever met a policeman .
I was doing it long before you meet you girls .
it &apos;s been my main occupation for years , and I &apos;ll probably still be doing it after you both are married and settle down with twins of your own ...
which you &apos;re very likely to have .
what is your purpose in this ?
the purpose of all research , to learn as much as possibly about the subject .
in my case . to add to my knowledge about identical twins .
- And you &apos;d pay us ?
- $ 25 per week for each .
that &apos;s the customary allowance .
for that I &apos;d expect you to come to the laboratory at least 3 times per week , separately for 2 hours .
what do you think ?
I don &apos;t think we &apos;re interested . I don &apos;t like the idea of being a guinea pig .
I don &apos;t want to press you if you &apos;re afraid in any way ...
we have nothing to be afraid of nothing but snooperous .
in that case , there is nothing more to be said .
I &apos;m sorry for giving that impression .
I &apos;m sorry too .
I think we should do it .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;s a snooper , and we could certainly use the money .
you don &apos;t mind being ask a lot of personal questions ?
why should I ? or why should you ?
it &apos;s for a good purpose . there is no reason to fear it because we do need the money .
and because ...
we &apos;ve always liked Dr. Elliott . both of us .
talk it over between yourselves and call me .
I hope you can see things Terry &apos;s way , but if you can &apos;t , I &apos;ll understand .
I hope to be seeing you both soon .
Goodbye . we will call you .
what &apos;s the matter with you ?
do you think that was very wise ?
what are you afraid of ?
- I &apos;m not afraid . it &apos;s ...
- Don &apos;t lie about it . you are afraid .
you &apos;re more afraid every day . why ?
Terry , you know very well what it is .
you think I killed him . why don &apos;t you amid it ?
I don &apos;t !
then why are you so frightened ?
if they knew which one was in the apartment that night ...
he proposed and I said yes . why should I kill him ?
I know you didn &apos;t do it .
I &apos;m willing to do anything to keep them knowing that you were home that night .
that &apos;s the only reason I &apos;m frightened . please believe me .
then is there anything for yourself that you &apos;re afraid for Elliot to learn ?
of course not .
then stop worrying , there &apos;s no need for it .
besides , he is very attractive , very good looking .
I like him .
- You don &apos;t think we can fool you now ?
- Not anymore , Terry .
I even have you spotted in the magazine stand .
how do you mean ?
I know some of the times when it was you and some of the times when it was Ruth .
not all , of course , but some .
what was the difference ?
I do not know ... meaning , I &apos;m not sure yet .
which one do you like the best ?
- You .
- Really ?
sit over here , will you .
- Why ?
- Why what ?
why do you say you like me best ?
because that &apos;s always the response during office hour .
what is this one ?
these are pictures of ink spots .
the kind you probably made yourself when you were a child .
it is just a stain and the paper folded over .
what is it for ?
it &apos;s another way of studying personality .
I &apos;m going to hand them to you one by one and you tell me what you see .
what it looks like to you .
- Quickly ?
- If you see it quickly , sure .
as soon as you make something out of it , you tell me . ready ?
face that way , please .
well , what does it look like to you ?
it might be a mask .
the black slit for eyes , heavy eyebrows and lips giving it a fixed expression .
anything else ?
- May I turn it ?
- Anyway you wish .
this looks like a white lamb with a black nose .
he got a mark on its forehead .
it looks like a moth spreading its wing over a butterfly .
beneath his feet , there are two men face down , arms outstretched .
it all seems symbolic of something .
the lamb looks so innocent but it has two men under its paws .
symbolic of what ?
the lamb &apos;s death ?
I wonder if you are as so cool as you pretend .
- No .
- I think so either .
outside the office I &apos;m a real tear with jet propulsion .
what do you see ?
what does it looks like to you Terry ?
these are two men , back to back . but they seem ignorant about each other .
now it &apos;s changing into a full face of a man , with mustache and slanted eyes .
here is a dancer , a woman dancing with a puppet .
the puppet reaching to a rival who pretends to ignore it .
but all the time it try to reach to do her some harm .
can I have a cigarette ?
why did you leave Nebraska , Ruth ?
we lived in a farm for about a year , and the farmer &apos;s wife wanted to adopt me because she could not bear children .
they could only afford one of us .
why you instead of Terry ?
it just happened . I suppose no particular reason .
but Terry was very upset when she heard about it - naturally .
so we decided to pull out .
what do you see ?
two people in costume dancing around a pole .
they are bending over .
- It &apos;s that what you wanted ?
- Yes . anything else ?
you can turn it if you wish .
these are two skaters like in the ice show .
and they are leaning backward and the arm extension .
Terry how did she find out ?
from the farmer , I suppose . he never liked her for some reason .
was he cranky ?
no , I got along fine with him , but Terry ...
what do you see ?
two old ladies sitting back to back in an open streetcar like those in San Francisco .
they seem frightened .
they are clinging to their seats and their feet are under the seat .
and look at those chins !
that &apos;s a drum majorette , with a high bear shako .
she &apos;s very straight and graceful .
and she got her knee high in the air .
thank you very much .
well , it &apos;s about time !
sorry I &apos;m late .
- Did you go through town ?
- No . Scott and I just talked .
after that ink spot stuff . who do you suppose ever thought that one up ?
talking about what ?
just gapping .
Chicago , movies , when we were kids .
not about us ?
no , mostly about himself . he was funny about his school .
he must have been .
he was , really .
once he drops that office act , he is awful funny .
the way he was before , remember .
is that his line , down the memory lane ?
I don &apos;t think it was a line , he just wanted to talk .
nothing romantic ?
I &apos;m afraid not .
dear me , you sound disappointed .
you &apos;re not falling for him ?
my goodness , Terry , sometimes it seems as if that &apos;s all you think about !
falling for someone !
of course not !
just don &apos;t want to see you do anything foolish .
Yes , Momma .
I &apos;m not convinced yet that he &apos;s is strictly on the level with us .
I don &apos;t know , of course .
I can &apos;t believe it .
perhaps not , but if I were you , I &apos;d be a little careful not too friendly .
if only we weren &apos;t so ...
I know . it &apos;s not very pleasant .
but as long as we are , we just have to be on our guard with everybody .
particularly him .
well , it &apos;s something I hadn &apos;t figured on . never even dreamed of .
as promised , I will not ask any questions .
all I can do is to stand here , and wait for whatever you want to tell me .
you know the ink spot test ?
I made several other tests to check and cross-check .
in the ink spot test about 80 % of the people will in general see the same figure , the same illusions .
what the other 20 % see reflecting the true secret pattern of their own mind and personality .
in this case , there don &apos;t seem to be any doubt about one thing .
one of our young women is insane .
very clever , very intelligent , but insane .
this is called a free association test .
and it &apos;s so simple that even I understand .
if you are looking for smarter one I can save you a lot of time : it was Terry .
is that official ?
it &apos;s the funny thing . I was born 7 minutes and 55 seconds before her , but that is not the way it feels .
she has been the older sister .
always helping me , and protecting me .
and like a mother too , because we &apos;ve been orphans since we were 10 .
this is not a contest .
I &apos;m interested in absolute , not comparative results .
Yes , sir .
you know ... ?
I &apos;m a very pleased man today .
and I haven &apos;t been for almost a week because you haven &apos;t seemed happy .
I &apos;m sorry .
I was afraid I &apos;ve done something that offended you .
I did not mean to .
I was something else , I was a little worried - about something else .
- But it &apos;s all right now ?
- Yes , okay .
Good. the way it ought to be .
but back to cold science .
I &apos;m gonna give you some words and you answer with the first word that comes into your mind .
not a sentence , just one word .
and answer as quickly as you can . that &apos;s the important part .
are you ready ?
table .
chair .
ready ?
dark .
night .
- Moon .
- Beams .
- Knife .
- Scissors .
- White .
- Black .
- Mirror .
- Death .
King .
Queen .
blossom .
flower .
- River .
- Lake .
how could you have said it ?
how do I know . it just popped out .
I don &apos;t understand all this fuss . what possible harm can it do ?
none !
none whatever !
I don &apos;t give two cents for that fellow and his kindergarten games .
it can do that test 24 / 7 , And beat him at it every time .
he can &apos;t frightened me with that stuff .
it &apos;s you I &apos;m worried about .
why ?
because it shows your mind is still on that thing and you can &apos;t deny it .
when he said &quot; mirror &quot; you said &quot; dead &quot; that proved it .
it may not mean anything to him , but it does to me , and it &apos;s a dead giveaway , that you think I had something to do with it .
Terry , please !
I &apos;ve told you ...
why do you keep saying a thing like that ?
forget it !
but you have not right even to think .
why do you take these sleeping pills ?
- Because I can &apos;t sleep without them .
- Why can &apos;t you ?
because my nerves are still bad . I haven &apos;t got over everything yet .
neither of us has .
is that all ?
- What other reason could there be ?
- Not your conscience ?
my conscience about what ?
perhaps you &apos;re sorry you didn &apos;t tell the police everything you know .
maybe that &apos;s what troubling you .
maybe you think you should do it even now ?
this is ridiculous !
such a thought never entered my head .
because , if you are , the phone is there ...
Terry , stop it !
you &apos;re talking nonsense !
- Am I ?
- Of course you are !
I hope so .
because if you ever suspected me ,
I do not know what I would do ...
I really don &apos;t ...
table .
chair .
- Moon .
- Stars .
King .
Queen .
- Death .
- Mirror .
girl .
woman .
- Black .
- White .
- Rose .
- Thorn .
I have an idea , you are not impressed with this stuff .
no ? then why do you think I &apos;m here ?
just to humoring the old professor .
- Is that all ?
- Nothing else to do .
had it ever occurred to you that I might like seeing you .
no it hadn &apos;t ...
don &apos;t you like to see me ?
if you knew how anxious I was for you to get here you wouldn &apos;t have to ask that .
- Honest ?
- Very honest .
then maybe we could see each other outside the office .
we will , I &apos;m sure .
- Would you like to ?
- Very much .
- All right , when ?
- Soon .
but not before we finish with these test I &apos;m afraid .
what does that got to do with it ?
it &apos;s hard enough for me to keep my mind on science as it is don &apos;t make it anymore difficult for me .
the first night afterward ?
- It &apos;s a date .
- Remember .
I will remember , Terry .
I was really crazy about that boy , but Terry simply couldn &apos;t stand him .
she insisted that he wasn &apos;t on the level , and she was right .
how did you find out ?
he dated her one night and she told me .
Terry turned in .
how many men have you been crazy about ?
that was just a kid stuff . we were about 16 .
all this biography I &apos;m given you is this for science too ?
no , this is personal .
the more I know about you , the more I wanna know .
I want to know everything about you , for myself .
and apparently you will . good night .
do you think , when this is over , I can ask you out to dinner , dancing or just to talk , in a purely personal way ?
you think you &apos;ll still want to ?
I &apos;m looking forward to it . do you mind ?
no . I like it .
you are a wonder !
it &apos;s all right . I &apos;m not asleep .
don &apos;t turn on the light .
I &apos;ll undress in the bathroom .
you &apos;re taking a sleeping pill tonight ?
no , I slept all right last night .
- I think you better take two .
- Two ?
why on earth for ?
if you take two , maybe you won &apos;t be so troubled in your sleep .
- You mean I talked ?
- Talked , cried .
you scare me half to death sometimes .
good heavens !
- Dreaming , I suppose .
- No .
you don &apos;t remember what you dream ?
I don &apos;t remember even dreaming .
you don &apos;t remember my waking you last night
- when you were sobbing .
or what you said to me ?
what did I say ?
so big deep sobs , you were terrified as if you were seeing something so dreadful you couldn &apos;t bear to face it .
you don &apos;t remember what it was ?
I do not remember anything .
but I thought you awakened .
pretty haring for a few minutes .
but I can &apos;t imagine what it was to frighten me so .
- Has it happened before ?
- A few times .
one night you were rather gay for a change .
you seemed to have dreamed something about Scott .
- You think a lot of him often ?
- I do like him but ...
does he like you ?
some , I imagine .
ever said anything ?
nothing serious , just casual things ...
ever kissed you ?
he maybe just trying to pump you .
I don &apos;t think so .
don &apos;t you want to know what seems to be frightening you ?
I don &apos;t know .
you talked about before in your sleep .
you were worried about one of us being ... crazy .
the old saying , that one of the twins is likely to be abnormal .
but that &apos;s not true , that &apos;s a superstition .
you heard Scott telling the D.A. that .
I know .
that &apos;s an old wives tale we &apos;ve heard it for years but it &apos;s not true .
didn &apos;t you hear Scott say it wasn &apos;t ?
Yes , I heard him .
this is so awful .
it frightens me .
the whole idea of talking and dreaming and sobering and ... and don &apos;t remembering nothing about it .
it can &apos;t be very pleasant , but it &apos;s not really so important , just bad dreams .
I know but ... Such a thought ...
what &apos;s this one ?
blood pressure and pulse .
- A lie detector ?
- That &apos;s an easy name . do you mind ?
why should I ?
what do you want me to talk about ?
I &apos;ll let you know when we are ready .
- How much longer ?
- Winding up this week .
Friday afternoon and that &apos;s that .
- The whole thing ?
- Yes , the work is complete .
- Then Saturday is the night .
- The night ?
- If you tell me you &apos;ve forgotten ...
- Oh , sure .
- Remember ?
- That &apos;s right .
well ?
I &apos;m afraid I did forget . I &apos;m terribly sorry .
you mean you can &apos;t make it ?
any other night , but ...
what a man !
and me thinking that he was simply living for that night .
it &apos;s inexcusable . but we finish sooner than expected .
who &apos;s my rival ?
you have no rival .
is that always the answer during office hour too ?
your memory is too good .
come on , shall we go with this now and straighten the thing out later ?
there &apos;s nothing to straighten out . my heart is broken , that &apos;s all .
let &apos;s have the machine .
all I want you to do is to answer a few simple questions .
not on any forbidden subject . you needn &apos;t worrying .
it &apos;s all over the whole thing . ask me anything you &apos;d wish .
does that goes for Ruth too ?
that you better ask her .
of course .
I hope so , anyway .
you &apos;ve both been through a terrible ordeal if you manage to come out of it okay ... that &apos;s wonderful .
what are you gonna ask me ?
you were telling me the other day about when your were living in Ohio , before moving to Chicago .
anything interesting about that time ?
off hand ...
I believe that Ruth was telling me about a boy she went with that you didn &apos;t care much for .
Freddie Eckland .
Yes , I think ...
in Dayton .
what did she say ?
she told that you said he wasn &apos;t on the level and proved it .
was she complaining ?
good heaven , no !
she was grateful .
she was rambling about how you were always looking out for her like a older sister .
did she tell you that I met him first ?
no , I don &apos;t think she did .
the truth is that I met him first and introduced him to her .
he did care the slightest for her , and I knew it .
he started to go around with her .
without her even dreaming that it was me he was interesting .
what is it , dear ?
that light again !
wake up . you &apos;re dreaming again .
no , it wasn &apos;t a dream !
didn &apos;t you see it ?
there wasn &apos;t anything to see . you &apos;re dreaming .
it wasn &apos;t a dream !
it wasn &apos;t asleep !
the whole room lighted up , Terry !
now , you &apos;re all right .
there is nothing to be afraid of .
but I was sure I saw it .
it doesn &apos;t matter , it really doesn &apos;t .
but what is it , what do you think it is ?
something is happening to me and I don &apos;t know what it is !
I don &apos;t understand it !
you &apos;re just imagine things .
your nerves playing tricks on you , that &apos;s all .
I &apos;m so scared !
I &apos;m scared !
I don &apos;t know what to do !
it &apos;s nothing really .
just remember I &apos;m with you and always will be with you .
so that &apos;s all there is to it ?
Yes , that &apos;s all I &apos;m afraid .
I didn &apos;t promise you a great deal more .
all I can say is that Ruth did not do it .
she &apos;s simple isn &apos;t capable of that sort of thing .
that does narrows it down a bit .
Terry is paranoiac , and has no conscience , no sense of right and wrong than that of a two year old .
paranoiac is capable of anything .
that &apos;s something , but not much .
you can &apos;t run loonies until they have done something .
if the family don &apos;t see fit to admit them , you &apos;ve to wait until someone is set on fire .
unfortunately .
pretty tough on Ruth .
you &apos;re gonna tell her ?
I suppose so .
but it &apos;s not gonna be easy .
- She hasn &apos;t a ghost of suspicion .
- No ?
what about that double alibi ?
she could &apos;ve been tricked . Terry could &apos;ve trick her .
much applied , anyway .
sorry I couldn &apos;t have been more help to you .
- You gonna see Ruth again soon ?
- I expect to .
tell her no matter how hard it is .
because the other one will pop off again before it &apos;s over .
it &apos;s quite possible .
and watch out for yourself .
I don &apos;t think I figure seriously in that calculation .
she didn &apos;t mind these tests , it was just another challenge a chance to show the world her contempt .
that was the first tip I got from her .
you said that there was no pattern to a psychotic &apos;s calculations .
don &apos;t be too modest .
- All right , I &apos;ll tell her .
- When ?
tonight if I can .
it might help if Terry came out and spit on the sideway or something then we could pick her up .
if I was that doctor I would feel nervous .
why ?
because from what he said he looks like a new Peralta .
the target for tonight ?
that &apos;s the way it is .
the minute the doctor falls in love with his patient , from then on he is as effective as a papoose .
Hello , Ruth ?
Hello Scott !
how are you , dear ?
you are alone ?
Yes . why ?
I don &apos;t want Terry to know .
- Could I see you alone tonight ?
- Of course . when ?
whatever you say .
could I make it rather late ?
around 11 ?
she will be asleep by then .
it &apos;s all right for me .
suppose I come to your apartment at 11 ?
I &apos;ll leave the door open . it &apos;s upstairs .
I understand .
do you mind ?
no . of course not .
I couldn &apos;t be more pleased .
there &apos;s no one I would rather see walk in that door .
I saw your light and I thought if you weren &apos;t busy for a little while .
I was wondering what to do next .
not that &apos;s anything important ...
feeling depressed ?
something like that .
have you had your dinner ?
instead of dinner with me tomorrow night
how about having dinner with me tonight and tomorrow night and as many other nights as you can spare .
tonight , dear , we should have it with music !
are you sure you don &apos;t want to tell me ?
what causes hallucinations ?
hallucinations ?
things you imagine you see or hear . what causes them ?
bad nerves .
just nerves ?
or a sick mind .
- May I explain something ?
- No , please don &apos;t .
I think I &apos;d like to go home now .
would you get my bag and gloves ?
of course . I &apos;ll be right back .
police headquarters .
Lieutenant Stevenson , please .
Lieutenant ?
this is Scott Elliott .
what do you think of me being a human booby trap .
so you got the picture at last ?
it &apos;s possible .
would you still be there 10 : 30 ?
I wanna talk about something that has come up something that maybe more on your line than mine .
I &apos;ll be right here from 10 : 39 on .
- Here we go again ?
- Looks .
he is no fool for a university .
- Are you ready ?
- Thanks .
come on , you can do better than that .
I was worried . where did you go ?
walk .
- With Scott ?
- No .
haven &apos;t you seen him ?
he called around 7 .
- Who ?
- Scott .
I tell you I haven &apos;t seen him .
you just come in ?
no , I &apos;m just going out ...
to dance .
I don &apos;t know whether to leave you home alone or not .
do not be silly , I &apos;m all right .
have you been taking your capsule ?
- No .
- Why ?
they &apos;re no good .
maybe you don &apos;t take enough .
but be careful , don &apos;t take too many .
look , darling , try not to worry so much .
no matter what happens they can &apos;t do a thing without my consent , and I will never in the world do that , believe me .
I know .
so don &apos;t be too scared .
you and I are gonna be together as long as we live .
remember that , darling , always .
good night .
I won &apos;t stay out too late .
I &apos;m so glad you came .
I wondered about how you lived .
I apologize . but I have no wife to keep it messed up .
- Could I get you something to drink ?
- No , thanks .
I hope I didn &apos;t alarm you with all that mystery ?
I was just puzzled that you needed an excuse .
I would have come anyway .
but it wasn &apos;t an excuse .
I was seriously , it was something I thought we should discus privately .
- Does it have to be tonight ?
- I &apos;m afraid so , my dear .
it &apos;s about Terry .
you don &apos;t like Terry ?
- Of course I like her .
- But ... ?
but , I love you .
why ?
- Why do I love you ?
- Why me and not her ?
I &apos;m very curious .
why choose me instead of her ?
we &apos;re so much alike .
what did you see in me that you didn &apos;t see in her ?
how can I answer that ?
all I know , is that you &apos;re the one I fell in love .
am I better looking than she ?
- To me you are , of course !
- Don &apos;t laugh .
I &apos;m serious , I want to know what you think different is .
for instance , Kiss me .
do you really believe you could tell that one from one of Terry &apos;s ?
or my lips from hers ?
I think so .
- Have you ever kissed her ?
- No .
then how can you possible know ?
I &apos;m not sure , but I think I would know in my heart .
- Would you really ?
- I think so .
I don &apos;t believe it for a second .
I want to asked you anyway because it &apos;s Terry they usually go for .
she is the one that really sense them .
that &apos;s not true .
but of course it &apos;s true .
Terry is the smart one . I &apos;ve told you that before .
no , they don &apos;t go for it , that &apos;s the trouble with her .
- That &apos;s why I wanted to talk to you .
- I don &apos;t know what you mean .
it &apos;s not an easy thing to tell you , but I feel I should
Terry is not well ... she &apos;s sick ... inside .
she needs help from you and me if possible .
&quot; sick &quot; ?
how ?
she is twisted inside .
how it got started I don &apos;t know .
some incident when you were babies , I imagine .
there is a strong rivalry between sisters and ever since that incident , it &apos;s growing more and more bitter in her until now it &apos;s - abnormal .
she needs care right away .
Terry and I has never been rivals .
not the slightest !
all women are rivals but it never bothers them because they automatically discount the success of others and alibi their own failures in the ground of circumstances .
luck they say .
between sisters it &apos;s a little bit more serious .
the circumstances are in general the same so they have fewer excuses which to comfort them self with .
that &apos;s way sisters can hate each other so intense .
as for twins , especially identical twins you must have some idea yourself what agony of jealousy is possible .
go on .
people , men particularly , find it easy enough to like you you &apos;re a natural and normal .
thank God you have manage to escape that poison of jealousy .
but not she ...
on the surface there is little to choose between you .
that is of course a lie !
I &apos;m sorry but it isn &apos;t .
it &apos;s the whole history of her case by your word as well as hers . the boy Dayton
the lawyer in Chicago , the family that wanted to adopt you but not her .
it &apos;s the same story over again .
whoever they met first , you were the one they preferred .
I &apos;ve never listen to such utter nonsense !
I called you because I want you to talk to her about it .
I want you to persuade her to go to a doctor .
I want you to get her to do this at once .
and if I refuse to insult her with this ?
you mustn &apos;t . it &apos;s important that she gets this care immediate .
and if she refuses ?
if you refuse ...
Terry ,
I &apos;m afraid I &apos;ll have to tell who killed Frank Peralta , and why !
you can &apos;t !
you don &apos;t know !
I think I do .
not that it matter , because there is nothing you can do about it even you guess .
shall I remind you anyway ?
if you wish .
Peralta was killed because the same thing happened to you again it was Ruth he really loved without even knowing she even existed .
it was your he courted , you he asked to marrying him .
he didn &apos;t know there were twins , all he knew was that sometimes the girl at the counter lacked a warm that he missed .
that &apos;s why he asked me about split personality .
nor do I thing you knew about it until that night in his apartment where he spoke about the curious difference in you .
then you knew it had happen again .
it was Ruth he was in love with , not you .
so you made sure that if you couldn &apos;t have his love neither should Ruth .
who else have you told this to ?
who else have you told this ridiculously story to ?
nobody else so far and there &apos;ll be no need to tell it again if you do what I suggest .
go to your doctor and be guided by what he says .
I see no need for that .
as I told you , there &apos;s nothing you can do about it no matter how strongly you feel .
you don &apos;t think so ?
no . I &apos;m afraid you &apos;ve just been wasting your time .
- Haven &apos;t you forgot Ruth ?
- Not at all .
but you must have , because she won &apos;t take this &quot; ridiculously &quot; story so lightly .
I don &apos;t suppose so . she have been behaving so strange lately that I won &apos;t put anything past her .
but I doubt that anyone would take seriously the word of a girl who suffers from hallucinations .
or hasn &apos;t she told you ?
what do you mean by that ?
where &apos;s Ruth now ?
are you so sure of which one you &apos;ve kissed ?
of course .
look closely . are you certain ?
do you still got that Terry with you ?
could you bring her here or do you want me to sent the wagon ?
- Who is that ?
- The guy from the hospital .
I bee with you in a minute .
sorry , doc , but I have bad news .
I got nervous when I left you and I decided come here and take a look .
I hate to have to tell you this , but when I got in here ...
what ?
all right Stevenson , I &apos;ll be right over .
Ruth has committed suicide .
does that surprises you ?
I &apos;m terribly sorry , but ...
I &apos;m terribly sorry , Miss Collins .
sit here .
- May I go in ... ?
- If you want to .
the examiner is in there . you go with him Franklin .
can you tell me what happened ?
she took some of this sleeping pills .
it was empty in the bathroom .
she has been taking it for the last 2 or 3 months .
I hate to have to ask you questions , but did she have any reasons ?
Yes , I &apos;m afraid she did .
- What was it , Miss Collins ? - Her conscience .
take your time . I &apos;m not pressing you .
I &apos;m all right ...
it &apos;s just that I have been under such a strain and now this .
she is free now , poor darling , and I have a right to some peace too .
of course you have . tell me everything .
you &apos;d feel better .
she killed him .
she said she didn &apos;t , but I know she did .
I believed her at first .
kept on believing her . but now I know that she did it .
take this down .
that night , what happened ?
I got home from the park , she was in bed .
I thought asleep .
when it all came out , she made me promise not to say anything .
- You believed her then ?
- Yes , but ...
something was the matter with Terry .
- She was twisted .
- You mean Ruth ?
no , Terry . I &apos;m Ruth .
it was a kind of deep bitterness .
wait !
I thought you were Terry !
no , I &apos;m talking about Terry , I &apos;m Ruth .
- But didn &apos;t you ... ?
- Didn &apos;t I what ?
nothing . I am a little ...
go on .
then Scott found out about it and he told me tonight , he told me she was not right ... she was sick inside ... sick with jealousy ... and that is why she killed him .
he didn &apos;t know that we were two of us ...
just a minute !
- What are you trying to pull ?
- I &apos;m just telling what you told me .
just about what you told me .
but this isn &apos;t Ruth , this is Terry !
Scott , we &apos;ve been over that .
this is ridiculous !
I know this is Terry !
how do you know ?
I &apos;ve been studying them daily for almost two months .
I have no difficulty with telling them apart .
can you prove it ?
she says she &apos;s Ruth and she sounds like Ruth .
prove me wrong ...
- Shall I go on ?
- We &apos;re getting somewhere .
the tests only showed what I have known for a long time , that she hated me , because men finds it easy to like me .
it was always the same story over and over again .
Whichever they met first ...
I &apos;m sorry , dear !
- You &apos;re not surly ?
- Of course not .
I didn &apos;t explain because I didn &apos;t know myself until I got here .
it was only after a talk with Ruth . the idea came to me .
then it was too late to explain . I just had to take a chance .
you &apos;d age me 10 years but under the circumstances I forgive you .
you know why I got nervous ?
psychological reasons .
I got to think about what you &apos;d told me and I realized that Ruth was in danger .
it is simpler to get rid a rival than go knocking off her boyfriends all the rest of her life .
I take back what I said about the police .
$ 9.75 this week only .
was the mirror me ?
the reflection was .
that &apos;s what twins are . Reflections of each other . everything in reverse .
- Will you answer one question for me ?
- What ?
under the circumstance you &apos;ll say it is impossible , but why are you so much more beautiful than your sister ?
to me , a dollar was a dollar in any language .
on my first night in Argentina , I didn &apos;t know about the locals .
but I knew about American sailors . I knew I &apos;d better get out of there .
put your hands up . up !
get going .
- A cane like that is handy .
- It is a faithful friend .
mostly silent , but talks when I need it to .
that &apos;s your idea of a friend ?
you must lead a gay life .
- I lead the life I like to lead .
- You &apos;re a lucky man .
- What are you doing here ?
- Saving your life .
- He only wanted the money .
- But you &apos;d not have parted with it .
- I don &apos;t think I would .
- How did you get the money ?
- Gambling .
- I &apos;ll leave you here .
I &apos;ll do the same for you some time ... give you a cigarette .
why not try some real gambling ?
- Isn &apos;t it illegal in Buenos Aires ?
- Yes .
there &apos;s a casino on the other side of town . here &apos;s the key .
but don &apos;t go . they won &apos;t let you use your own dice .
- I didn &apos;t think it showed .
- I make my own luck , as you do .
in any event , they won &apos;t let you in without a tie .
the spot is not on your nose , yet .
- Who is he ?
- A loafer .
would you like a fine perfume , suitable for nobility ?
we have a talcum powder as soft as raw silk .
- Towel ?
- Thank you .
- Hey , who &apos;s she ?
- A harpy .
- How would you classify me ?
- Peasant .
place your bets .
place your bets , ladies and gentlemen .
- Number 2 . 1,000 pesos .
number two , black .
place your bets , ladies and gentlemen .
- Two chips .
- 1,000 pesos , sir .
cut ... The player &apos;s allowed to cut at any time .
of course .
1,000 pesos .
cut .
cut .
as usual , I made my own luck , and I knew when to stop letting it ride .
the director wants to see you .
is Brooklyn across the river here , too ?
let &apos;s go .
- Hey .
- Thanks , peasant .
- Where is he ?
- Don &apos;t worry . he &apos;ll be here .
- How about 1,000 pesos a piece ?
- You can &apos;t buy your way out of it .
wait a minute .
all right , Casey , Huerta .
- The man with the sharp friend .
- I said not to bring your own dice .
you really had me fooled last night .
I thought you were someone , not just the manager of a gambling joint .
- My name is Ballin Mundson .
- Johnny Farrel .
and I &apos;m not the manager , I own the &quot; joint &quot; .
- And I don &apos;t like to be cheated .
- There isn &apos;t a dice table ...
nobody wins that much at 21 honestly . you cut the cards well .
it took me years to learn .
you ought to be in jail , but I &apos;m obligated , since I saved your life .
- You should be more careful .
- Get out of here . don &apos;t come back .
you &apos;re being very stupid .
- Probably . - It &apos;s better I gamble on your side .
- I don &apos;t like my people cheating .
- I cheat with my own money , sure .
but with your money , I wouldn &apos;t have to cheat . think it over .
I think I will . how much time do you give me ?
no hurry , take a minute or two . excuse me while you decide .
not you .
you shouldn &apos;t hit a man who has his hands behind his back .
you can have two friends . I can be very faithful ... for a nice salary .
I must be sure there &apos;s no woman anywhere .
- Gambling and women don &apos;t mix .
- The very words I use myself .
- Shall we quit talking about it ?
- There was one ?
get this , I was born last night , when we met in the alley .
no past and all future . I like it that way .
he let me ease myself to the top . at first , I just watched the play .
by the way , about that time , the war ended .
great news . I thought we ought to celebrate , too .
Yes , of course .
well ...
I have to take a trip . I may be gone for a while . you &apos;re in charge .
- You &apos;ve been promoted .
- Do I get a raise ?
no . fair enough ? but you do get 5 % of the profits .
- I &apos;ll take 7 ½ .
- You &apos;re sharp .
almost as sharp as my other friend . but not quite so obedient .
- My other friend would kill for me .
- That &apos;s what friends are for .
to us , Johnny .
to the three of us .
it makes me laugh now , me being so sure it was the three of us .
I soon found out . I remember I was preparing for the Saturday crowd .
funny I &apos;d remember what day it was , isn &apos;t it ?
- Isn &apos;t it enough ?
- For a peasant ?
Mr. Farrel , Mr. Mundson is back . he &apos;d like you to come to his house .
after all , I run the place . he calls me Mr. Farrel .
isn &apos;t that better ?
you &apos;d think a bell would &apos;ve rung , some instinct of warning .
but I didn &apos;t . I just walked right into it .
Ballin ?
- Ballin ?
- He &apos;ll be down in a moment .
- Isn &apos;t it great having him back ?
- I hope it will be the same .
Johnny , is that you ?
- Hello , Ballin .
- Come up here .
what are you crying about ?
you look foolish .
- Where &apos;s the canary ?
- How did you know ?
come ...
this is where the canary is .
quite a surprise to hear a woman sing in my house , eh ?
it &apos;s quite ... a surprise .
- Gilda , are you decent ?
- Me ?
sure , I &apos;m decent .
Gilda , this is Johnny Farrel . Johnny , this is Gilda .
I &apos;ve heard a lot about you , Johnny Farrel .
really ?
I haven &apos;t heard a word about you . - Why , Ballin !
- I wanted to keep it as a surprise .
- You should have seen his face .
- Did you tell him why I &apos;m here ?
no , I wanted to save that as a surprise too .
Mrs. Ballin Mundson . is that all right ?
- Congratulations .
- You congratulate the husband .
- What do you say to the bride ?
- You wish her good luck .
- Good luck .
- Ballin says you believe in luck .
- We make our own luck .
- I &apos;ll have to try that , right now .
- Have him come to dinner tonight .
- It &apos;s an order .
we &apos;ll let you get dressed . it &apos;ll be the casino &apos;s first glimpse of you .
I &apos;ll look my very best . I want all the hired help to approve of me .
Goodbye , Mr. Farrel .
Johnny is such a hard name to remember , and so easy to forget .
Johnny ... there .
see you later , Mr. Farrel .
that &apos;s right , Mrs. Mundson .
- I &apos;ll see Johnny downstairs .
- I &apos;ll see him at the casino .
for some reason she doesn &apos;t like you .
- What makes you think that ?
- I know my wife .
- Why would she form such a feeling ?
- Maybe it &apos;s chemical .
she &apos;ll get over it .
- When did you meet her ?
- The day I left for the interior .
- When did you get married ?
- The day after .
- When I want something ...
- You buy it quick .
- Do you know anything about her ?
- It &apos;s an odd coincidence .
she said she was born the night we met .
all three of us with no pasts , just futures . isn &apos;t that interesting ?
- What &apos;s the matter with you ?
- &quot; Women and gambling don &apos;t mix . &quot;
my wife isn &apos;t just a &quot; woman &quot; .
- I could &apos;ve made a mistake .
- You did . don &apos;t make it again .
it starts already .
- What &apos;s this ?
- Tact .
- Ballin , will you help me ?
- See you at the casino .
it was all I could do to walk away .
I wanted to hit her , and him , too .
I wanted to go back and watch them secretly . I wanted to know .
I can never get a zipper to close . does that stand for something ?
- You were rude to him .
- To whom ?
- Johnny .
- Was I ?
you &apos;ll have to teach me good manners .
- I want you to like him .
- Are you sure about that ?
he &apos;s an attractive man , if you like the type .
- He &apos;s a boy .
- Boys can grow up quickly .
- Almost when you &apos;re not looking .
- But I &apos;ll be looking .
- Your shoes .
- It &apos;s about time .
- Shall I put them on your feet ?
- For how much ?
the charge is slight , as I always find this a revealing vantage point .
a worm &apos;s-eye view is so often the true one .
- You &apos;re quite a philosopher .
- One hears rumours .
to my department comes all the gossip .
one hears she is very beautiful .
and young , and American . you are also young and American .
- It will be interesting to watch .
- Maybe you should be fired .
Johnny , Mr. Mundson says to tell you that they &apos;re here .
- Have you seen her ?
- Cut that !
- What did I do ?
- You whistled . I heard you .
after all , she is Mrs. Mundson . so mind your manners .
Yes , it will be interesting to watch .
- Number two .
- No more bets .
number two , black .
number two , black . place your bets .
- Take over .
- Going into business for yourself ?
- Orders , Mr. Farrel .
- Not my orders ...
- Johnny , I &apos;ve been looking for you .
- Gambling is illegal in Argentina .
is that the reason for the pay-off ?
- Naturally . - Why doesn &apos;t it show on the books ?
- You may ask any question you wish .
- I just asked one .
let &apos;s have dinner . Gilda is much too beautiful to be left alone .
- You &apos;ve changed the subject .
- Yes .
I found him . very elusive chap .
- You &apos;re looking very beautiful .
- Can &apos;t you return the compliment ?
you &apos;re looking very beautiful .
if there &apos;s anything I love , it &apos;s a spontaneous compliment .
you &apos;re so nice that I &apos;ll show you my husband &apos;s coming-home present .
- Isn &apos;t it cute ?
- 50,000 pesos , and it &apos;s cute .
wait , let &apos;s drink to us . to the three of us .
- What &apos;s the matter , Johnny ?
- I get confused .
just a few weeks ago we drank to the three of us .
well , should I be jealous ?
- It was just a friend of mine .
- A him or a her ? that &apos;s an interesting question . Johnny ?
- A her .
- Why that conclusion ?
because it looks like one thing , then it suddenly becomes another .
you haven &apos;t much faith in the stability of women .
one wonders what woman brought Johnny to this pretty pass .
one does . let &apos;s hate her , shall we , Ballin ?
- Let &apos;s . shall we , Johnny ?
- Let &apos;s . that I &apos;ll drink to .
pardon me .
- Anything I can do ?
- No , I &apos;ll be right back .
isn &apos;t this something . it &apos;s a small world in Argentina . - Why did you marry him ?
- He &apos;s an attractive man .
- You don &apos;t love him .
- What was that word again ?
you married him for his money . that &apos;s a great way to make a living .
- The pot calling the kettle black ?
- I was down and out . he saved me .
what a coincidence ! that &apos;s the story of my life ...
Hello .
I am Captain Delgado . I would like permission to dance with your lady .
- The answer is no .
- The answer is yes . I &apos;d love it .
- But the young man ...
- He &apos;d love to , but can &apos;t afford it .
women can be extremely annoying . Maurice Obregon , at your service .
so that &apos;s your name . I &apos;ve been watching you for weeks .
you don &apos;t gamble or drink . why do hang around here ?
the atmosphere has always interested me . now it fascinates me .
- You can be a professional dancer .
I mean , I was .
- That &apos;s against our union rules .
- I always observe the rules .
- How is it that I haven &apos;t seen you ?
- I danced in America .
- This is not America ?
- I mean New York .
- Is your young man also ... ?
- He &apos;s not my young man .
the expression on his face says he wishes he were .
- Remember the rules .
- The rules are changeable .
everything all right ?
who are the two krauts ?
- Messenger boys .
- Whose ?
- I thought you may be in trouble .
- I am . my wife seems to be missing .
- She &apos;s dancing .
- You shouldn &apos;t have allowed it .
what could I do ?
she &apos;s not my ... She &apos;s your wife .
- Go get her .
- Wait a minute ...
a husband looks ridiculous dragging his wife from another man &apos;s arms .
I &apos;ll get her .
- Your husband is showing .
- Thank you . perhaps again .
- Until then , I shall be miserable .
- There &apos;s something about Latin men .
for one thing , they can dance . for another thing ...
what &apos;s your number ? never mind , I &apos;ll give you mine . Cuyo 3017 .
- What did you say to him ?
- If a man answers , hang up .
you can &apos;t talk to men here the way you would at home .
- They think you mean it .
- Mean what ?
doesn &apos;t it bother you that you &apos;re married ?
does it bother you ?
I may have misjudged your Johnny . he can be sweet . so protective .
he takes care of everything that belongs to me .
you &apos;re to take care of me because I belong to the boss .
- I do all kinds of odd jobs .
- I bet this is the oddest .
I believe we were about to drink a toast .
disaster to the wench who did wrong by our Johnny .
- You won &apos;t drink to that ?
- Why not ? disaster to the wench .
she managed to say it , but I knew it would haunt her .
anyone as superstitious as Gilda , out loud , asking for disaster .
- Hi .
- You &apos;re still dressed .
- Anything wrong ?
- I told you , zippers throw me .
- You &apos;ll have a maid in the morning .
- Will she be old and ugly ?
it &apos;s smart to surround yourself with ugly women and beautiful men .
- You knew him before . - Who ?
- Johnny .
- Johnny Farrel ?
- You knew him before .
- Don &apos;t ever lie to me .
- I &apos;m telling the truth .
I don &apos;t think I ever knew him .
I see . you &apos;re a child , Gilda . a beautiful , greedy child .
I like to feed you beautiful things . you have such a good appetite .
- But I shouldn &apos;t make any mistakes ?
- No , you shouldn &apos;t .
if you &apos;re worried about Johnny Farrel , don &apos;t be . I hate him .
and he hates you . that &apos;s apparent .
but hate can be an exciting emotion .
haven &apos;t you noticed that ? there is a heat in it one can feel .
didn &apos;t you feel it tonight ?
it warmed me . hate is the only thing that has ever warmed me .
place your bets , ladies and gentlemen .
no more bets .
- 13 black .
- That &apos;s me !
this has been going on for years , and I didn &apos;t know about it ?
- One is not always lucky .
- I am .
- Careful , there &apos;s an old saying ...
- &quot; Lucky at cards , unlucky at love . &quot;
it &apos;s a good thing I &apos;m not superstitious .
keep it for me .
place your bets , ladies and gentlemen .
- Number two .
- No more bets .
place your bets .
- Got a light ?
- Yes , Mrs. Mundson .
- It is so crowded , yet so lonely .
- How did you know ?
you smoke too much .
only frustrated people smoke too much , and only the lonely are frustrated .
- Well , aren &apos;t you cute !
- Cute ? me ?
awfully cute . I think I &apos;m going to like you .
I &apos;m sorry . I was just tossing away my frustration .
- And it landed right on me .
- And that means something ?
- It means we &apos;ll have a drink .
- No ... On the other hand , I &apos;d love to .
- Now we &apos;ll see .
- See what ?
whether you are a gentleman , or a peasant .
the beautiful one is at the bar . she will probably have trouble .
- Really ?
what kind of trouble ?
- A very good-looking man .
your source of income is in his office . he will likely have trouble .
- What kind of trouble ?
- Also a man . not so good-looking .
now we know . you are what I said .
your business losses were reimbursed at the casino table , generously .
yet you continue to sell tungsten wire to Bendolin .
but Mr. Bendolin can &apos;t manufacture electric light globes without it .
- He can &apos;t continue in business ...
- We don &apos;t wish him to continue .
but he &apos;s the only outlet for my product .
if I don &apos;t sell to him , I can &apos;t continue . do you understand ?
- Perfectly .
- It doesn &apos;t matter to you , does it ?
I sympathise with you , deeply . life is difficult for defenceless people .
Yes , as you say . thank you , Mr. Mundson .
we &apos;re in the gambling business . what game uses light globes ?
let &apos;s join Gilda for a drink .
better let me case the joint first , see if the coast is clear .
I didn &apos;t like the look on the defenceless one &apos;s face .
all right . Gilda was right , you are protective .
sure , that &apos;s me all over . give me five minutes .
- Didn &apos;t you notice I &apos;m dancing ?
- You were .
- What &apos;s the idea ?
- I &apos;ve never finished a dance here .
when Ballin comes down , I want you to be alone .
- Is it Ballin who would object ?
- Who is this guy ?
Johnny Farrel , he runs the joint . this is Gabe Evans . isn &apos;t he cute ?
- Just darling .
get him out of here . - But I like him .
- If he leaves , I go with him .
- That &apos;s all right with me .
- What &apos;s keeping you ?
- Let &apos;s go where we can have fun .
- Like I said ?
- Exactly . didn &apos;t you hear about me ?
if I &apos;d been a ranch , they would &apos;ve named me &quot; The Bar Nothing &quot; .
- The coast is clear ?
- Very clear .
I &apos;m a big boy . you can tell me things .
Gilda warned me that you &apos;d grow up . by the way , where is she ?
she was bored . she went to see an American picture .
- Alone ?
- She doesn &apos;t know anybody here .
you &apos;d know more about that than I would .
he &apos;s dead .
it &apos;s bad form to make a scene in public .
only fools ruin themselves gambling .
- Come on home .
- What happened to him ?
- Did he kill himself ?
- Yes .
if a man is weak enough to accept a bribe , he is already a dying man .
- It didn &apos;t bother you ?
- That he killed himself ?
no . - It bothered me you were afraid .
- I was amazed .
I realised something could happen to me , so I want to tell you something .
over here , Johnny .
remember this .
remember this , too .
- Could you do it now by yourself ?
- Yes .
8 left , 24 right , 2 left , 17 right .
you &apos;re the only one who knows .
if anything should happen to me , there are signatures and instructions on how to carry on .
thanks for not letting me down . you don &apos;t just own a gambling joint ?
- You know what a cartel is ?
- A monopoly of some kind , isn &apos;t it ?
- An international monopoly .
- In what ? tungsten .
that doesn &apos;t impress you . is it worth getting shot at for the pleasure of monopolising it ?
a man who controls a strategic material can control the world .
- The world &apos;s a pretty big place .
- Made up of stupid little people .
- If it can be done , I &apos;d bet on you .
- And you &apos;d win . let &apos;s have a drink .
with you and Gilda on my side ...
you are on my side ?
- I told you that .
- And Gilda ?
- What do you mean ?
- Women are funny creatures .
- I don &apos;t know much about them .
- Odd things are important to them .
- I bought her , as I bought you .
- She knows that , doesn &apos;t she ?
that &apos;s just it . money doesn &apos;t mean much to Gilda .
if she should become restless ...
I &apos;m mad about her , Johnny .
mad ...
- What do you think of that ?
- It &apos;s great . she &apos;s on your side .
I &apos;d lay 8-5 on that , and I &apos;d win .
I &apos;d better get back .
I have the funniest feeling we &apos;re not alone .
maybe we &apos;re haunted . maybe if we go inside , it will go away .
besides being pretty , you &apos;re positively intelligent .
no .
I have the funniest feeling somebody said something .
maybe the lady forgot to tell you her husband lives here .
for a long time , I &apos;ve taken husbands in small doses .
- I &apos;ve developed immunity to them .
- You &apos;re through for tonight . scram .
- So he runs this joint , too ?
- I said , scram .
- Hitting a man when he &apos;s drunk ...
- He shouldn &apos;t get drunk on my time .
I take care of everything that belongs to the boss .
- What &apos;s his is yours ?
- You went to a picture show . alone .
really ...
would you like to know whether I enjoyed it ?
- That &apos;s what I told Ballin .
- Making me deceive my husband ...
I got news for you . he didn &apos;t just buy something , he loves you .
is that so hard to understand ?
I &apos;ve got news for you .
I &apos;m going to do what I please , when I please .
I was true to one man once , and look what happened .
- This is about him , not us .
- Really ?
you don &apos;t say so .
whatever you do , I &apos;m going to make sure it looks all right to him .
go anywhere , with anyone , but I &apos;ll take you there and bring you home .
exactly the way I take and pick up his laundry .
shame on you .
any psychiatrist would say your thought associations are revealing .
- What are you saying ?
- They &apos;d say it means something .
- Did you hear what I said ?
- You &apos;ll take me and pick me up .
all to protect Ballin .
who do you think you &apos;re kidding ?
I hated her so , I couldn &apos;t get her out of my mind .
she was in the air I breathed .
I thought I was dreaming . I &apos;d heard her voice in my sleep anyway .
then I realised ...
good morning . how pretty you look in your night-gown .
- What are you doing here ?
- Singing to my friend .
- How long have you been here ?
- How long ?
five verses . I was just listening .
- Did you hear that the poor cow ...
- Get out of here .
- Get back to your washroom .
- Put a beggar on horseback , huh ?
well , here &apos;s the laundry , waiting to be picked up .
- Where have you been ?
- Swimming .
I bet you don &apos;t believe me .
Ballin won &apos;t either , unless you &apos;re there to back me up .
you went swimming with me . didn &apos;t we have a good time ?
swimming ...
where &apos;s your bathing suit ?
under this . want to see ?
- I &apos;ll get dressed .
- I hate to drag you out now .
but it &apos;s your idea .
why not make it easy on yourself and let him find out about me ?
are you afraid of what he might do to me ?
Johnny ...
- I am .
- What ?
- Afraid .
- You ?
- I wish I &apos;d never ...
- Never what ?
getting married on the rebound is stupid .
- Rebound from what ?
- You .
because you don &apos;t know a man you &apos;ve only known one day .
he doesn &apos;t know you , either . that way you start even .
all fair and even .
would it interest you to know how much I hate you , Johnny ?
I hate you so much that I &apos;d destroy myself to take you down with me .
now I &apos;ve warned you . now that &apos;s all fair and even .
all fair and even .
I know why you &apos;re here at five in the morning . I &apos;m the laundry .
I &apos;m simply obeying instructions .
now who &apos;s kidding who ?
now you &apos;ve delivered me , don &apos;t you want to get a receipt from the man ?
- Ballin ... you &apos;re up .
- Yes .
- Late to bed , early to rise ...
- Let Gilda talk , Johnny .
I thought I could sneak out and get back without waking you .
we went swimming . you were asleep .
suddenly I had to go swimming . it was so hot .
- You weren &apos;t worried , were you ?
- Yes .
- I &apos;m terribly sorry .
- Is that why you &apos;re so nervous ?
nervous ?
no ...
a terrible thing happened to me . no wonder I &apos;m nervous .
- I lost the clip you gave me .
- Is that all ?
- Isn &apos;t that enough ?
- A clip can be replaced .
thanks for being so nice about it . I &apos;m sorry .
a clip can be replaced . you see , I thought I had lost you .
me ?
not a chance .
- And that couldn &apos;t be replaced .
- Let &apos;s have a drink , before I cry .
Johnny doesn &apos;t think it would be a tragedy if you lost me .
there are more women in the world than anything else , except insects .
on that charming observation , I shall go and change for breakfast .
Johnny is a terrific swimmer . he out-distanced me beautifully .
but some day there will be a return match , and then , look out , Johnny .
Johnny , you &apos;ll have to teach me how .
- How to what ?
- Swim , what else ?
- Sure . any time .
- Apparently you &apos;re very good at it .
- Pretty good .
- Did you teach Gilda how to swim ?
I taught her everything she knows . does that satisfy you ?
let &apos;s take that trombone part over again and make it cleaner .
Julio , Julio !
you can &apos;t tell me where to put it !
these are things some merry-makers add to their costumes .
- Care to make a choice ?
- You have a great sense of humour .
- Which would you suggest ?
- Whatever you wear ...
you will start out as this , and end up as this .
- How did you figure that out ?
- It is the beautiful one &apos;s party .
she has changed the decorations , the orchestra . maybe she &apos;ll change ...
I warned you once . you didn &apos;t listen . now you &apos;re through .
- Through with what ? - The casino .
you &apos;re fired .
you are mistaken . I will be here after you are gone , Mr. Peasant .
you once asked what a philosopher like me was doing in the washroom .
now I &apos;ll tell you . to my department comes all the gossip ...
he &apos;s not here . no one is here .
maybe the &quot; private &quot; sign should have been printed in German , too .
or maybe you can &apos;t speak Spanish . but I assure you , it says &quot; private &quot; .
we intend to see Mr. Mundson . he &apos;s been avoiding us .
Mr. Mundson is allergic to messenger boys .
the American Indian walks into something that doesn &apos;t concern him .
- That &apos;s an old American custom .
- You &apos;re not invited to the party .
- Tell the old man to go away .
- No , you go away .
- We intend to see Mr. Mundson . - You said that before ...
get him on the telephone .
why didn &apos;t you say what you wanted ?
Mr. Mundson . this is Mr. Farrel .
some add these to their costumes .
I have two lovely heads of pigs ...
no sale , Uncle Pio . they &apos;ll just use their own faces .
Ballin ?
there are two nice kids here with German accents .
they want an appointment with you . one of them has a gun in my back .
tell them to come here , in an hour .
and Johnny , you come now . immediately .
- Listen , Maria . carnival .
- Yes , little one . carnival .
- What does it mean , exactly ?
- The last three days before Lent .
in Roman Catholic countries , it &apos;s feasting and merry-making .
then comes the fasting and the penance .
- Make hay while the sun shines .
- You have a strange language .
I mean , three days of sowing wild oats and then comes the harvest .
Maria , I have the funniest feeling .
don &apos;t tell anybody , but I &apos;m awfully superstitious .
don &apos;t tell anybody .
I have the funniest feeling that this is it .
- It ?
- I mean ...
that for me , too , it &apos;s carnival .
Gilda ?
- Yes , Ballin ?
- May I come in ?
I &apos;m going to be delayed .
what &apos;s the matter ?
you &apos;re very excited about something . perhaps it &apos;s in the air .
perhaps you shouldn &apos;t have opened the window . close it .
see how quiet it is now ?
see how easily one can shut away excitement ?
just by closing a window . remember that , Gilda .
I want to see your costume before you go . I see you &apos;ll carry a whip .
have you warned Johnny , so he can also arm himself ?
nobody could ever dance like you .
when a person dances with you , it &apos;s like they &apos;re a part of you .
you always did talk your head off all the time you were dancing .
you used to say , &quot; One thing at a time . &quot;
&quot; talk or dance , but don &apos;t do both things at the same time . &quot;
- You used to say ...
- I still say it .
I have to keep talking , as long as I have my arms around you .
- I might forget to dance .
- What are you trying to do ?
I &apos;m not even trying very hard , but I &apos;m doing it .
doing what ?
- Push my hat back , Johnny .
- It &apos;s all right .
push it back .
you &apos;re out of practise , aren &apos;t you ? dancing , I mean .
I could help you get in practise again . dancing , I mean .
good evening .
Obregon . I &apos;m in again , as you put it .
- We &apos;re all here .
- Yes , we are .
I suggest sending Mrs. Mundson home . there &apos;s going to be trouble .
I suggest you get her out before the unmasking at twelve .
you sound like a bad melodrama .
- What are you doing ?
- Here &apos;s the comic relief .
- Now the drama &apos;s complete .
- What do you want ?
I got a letter for you . she was sorry she didn &apos;t get to say goodbye .
- No bad news , I hope ?
- Johnny , she left with ...
- What &apos;s that to you ?
- You sure act sore about it .
- You &apos;d think she was your ...
- Check everyone that comes in .
she didn &apos;t come in , she went out .
lose something , Mr. Farrel ?
- I didn &apos;t even know you &apos;d arrived .
- But obviously I did .
- Where &apos;s Gilda ?
- I can &apos;t keep track , in this mob .
find her for me .
sure . I won &apos;t guarantee how long it &apos;ll take .
I &apos;ll wait . I &apos;m a great one for waiting .
take your mask off , it &apos;s time to unmask .
- Going home would be a good idea .
- Why , because a man drank too much ?
that messenger boy didn &apos;t drink too much , he was murdered .
good . it saves us the trouble .
- Did your keep your appointment ?
- No , I missed them .
- Did you find Gilda ?
- No .
- Find her , take her home .
- I &apos;ll stick with you .
no . in chemin de fer , you play for the full stake or you pass the shoe .
you can &apos;t rule the world by passing the shoe .
do as I say . take her home . I expect my little friends to be obedient .
- Speaking of little friends ...
- Don &apos;t . wait for me at home . I may need both of my little friends tonight .
okay , Ballin .
this is Mundson . call the airfield , tell them to proceed as instructed .
is that clear ?
proceed as instructed .
- Ballin was wrong , wasn &apos;t he ?
- About what ?
he said you could shut out excitement by just closing a door .
you can &apos;t , can you ?
I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
I was just mentioning how quiet it was in the house .
there isn &apos;t anybody here but us . everybody &apos;s celebrating Carnival .
what about it ?
I was just mentioning it .
Goodnight , Johnny .
I couldn &apos;t get out of my head what she said about us being alone .
Ballin was in the casino , fighting for his life . and this little ...
I knew all his dreams of greatness would be wrecked because of her .
he wasn &apos;t strong enough to throw her out . I had to do it for him .
Gilda !
get your clothes on , you &apos;re getting out of here .
are we , Johnny ? are we ?
not we . you !
- You do hate me , don &apos;t you ?
- You have no idea how much .
hate is a very exciting emotion .
haven &apos;t you noticed ?
very exciting ...
I hate you too , Johnny .
I hate you so much , I think I &apos;m going to die from it .
darling ...
I think I &apos;m going to die from it .
you left it open when you came in .
Ballin !
Africa &apos;s more than 2,000 miles away .
- I don &apos;t think he &apos;ll make it .
- I don &apos;t think he intends to try .
- You managed it .
- Naturally . the sea plane is ready ?
- You ran into trouble ?
- An unfortunate murder .
Obregon knows I did it .
I &apos;ll stay away as long as necessary , then I &apos;ll go back , and attend to something .
in his will , Ballin left everything to Gilda , with me as sole executor .
I had the papers that Ballin said would let a man rule the world .
it didn &apos;t seem like much .
the tungsten mine , a few patents , a dozen small corporations that formed one organisation with Mundson at the head .
but then I saw the power . how it could gobble up the opposition .
you &apos;ve come a long way to learn what will happen to your association .
I &apos;ve told you . now you can return knowing that nothing has changed .
I &apos;ll carry on where Mr. Mundson left off .
- Anything else , gentlemen ?
- No one man should be in charge ...
I &apos;m the sole executor . it &apos;s going to be business as usual .
- Mrs. Mundson is the sole legatee .
- And in no condition to see anyone .
her husband &apos;s death hit her hard . she asked me to represent her .
we need be in no hurry to leave . she may recover .
not a chance in the world . she &apos;s marrying me this afternoon .
it stopped raining . maybe that means something .
you haven &apos;t got over being superstitious . come on .
- Not back to the house ?
- Do you think I &apos;m that kind of guy ?
no one knows what kind of guy you are but me .
all my clothes are here .
even my perfume . you think of everything .
we &apos;re right back where we started . right back where ...
right back where we started .
Johnny , that isn &apos;t even decent .
what was that word again ?
decent ... I said , &quot; decent &quot; .
that &apos;s what I thought you said . it sounded funny coming out of you .
she didn &apos;t know then that the door was closing on her own cage .
she wasn &apos;t faithful before , but she would be , now that he was dead .
why are you coming to work tonight ?
I believe in my duty to my job ...
good , because you &apos;ve got a new one .
from now on , you stick with Mrs. Mundson ...
Mrs. Farrel .
you &apos;re always with her . she talks to no one , and no one talks to her .
- You get that ?
- Is she in danger ?
you will be , if you don &apos;t do exactly as I &apos;ve told you .
- You were quiet this afternoon .
- What I have to say , I say to you .
- Not the others .
- I &apos;m flattered .
would you like to know how Mundson came to be the head of the cartel ?
- You saw the patents were German .
- They were .
- They belong to my principals .
- Not anymore .
three years ago , when Argentina was poised to declare war against us , we allowed Mundson to buy our patents .
- Good idea . the casino as a front .
- We even advanced him the money .
you couldn &apos;t have picked a nicer man .
we had an agreement . he was to return our property after the war .
- I didn &apos;t find any agreement .
- It was a gentleman &apos;s agreement .
- And he wasn &apos;t a gentleman ?
- He was a madman .
he thought he could rule the world .
I know . we had quite a discussion about it .
she still didn &apos;t believe I wasn &apos;t coming back .
every night she got dressed up and waited .
but Gilda couldn &apos;t stand not knowing the why of things , so she swallowed her pride and came to see me .
Yes ?
Hello . remember me ?
I &apos;m Gilda , your wife . remember ?
you haven &apos;t been around lately . I thought maybe you had amnesia .
got a light ?
you don &apos;t look so hot .
you &apos;re losing weight .
this vacuum I &apos;m living in ... Mind giving me a reason ?
you &apos;ve had such a full life up till now , -
- I thought some quiet would give you time to think .
- Think about what ?
- Is it too corny to say , your sins ?
- Yes , it is .
- Well , I said it .
you &apos;re cock-eyed , Johnny .
I figured that was the deal . you &apos;re getting even with me for something .
we &apos;re great people for getting even . aren &apos;t we ?
I got even with you by marrying Ballin .
- That &apos;s great . the man &apos;s dead ...
- And I &apos;m glad ! he was insane .
- I was afraid all the time .
there &apos;s never been anybody but you and me .
all those things I did were just to make you jealous .
- There &apos;s never been anybody else .
- Not anybody ?
not anybody .
if you could forget your husband so easily , you could forget others .
- But there weren &apos;t any others .
- Admit them . tell me who they were .
who &apos;d think one woman could marry two insane men in one lifetime ?
she wasn &apos;t scared , yet , because she didn &apos;t realise yet .
right now she was just mad , and she was hitting back .
try and locate a Mr. Gabe Evans . try all the hotels in the city .
she couldn &apos;t find him , so she reached out for anyone .
they weren &apos;t hard to find .
the waiter told him he had a call .
one of my men grabbed him outside . he never came back .
she found somebody else , of course .
but wherever she went ...
she finally realised Buenos Aires was her prison , so she ran away .
she got a job singing in a club in Montevideo .
she started divorce proceedings , and met a man .
let forever be tonight , is that a date ?
I haven &apos;t even got my divorce yet .
- I haven &apos;t any right to ...
- I don &apos;t want you to divorce .
the divorce you get here will never stand up in Argentina .
- But I &apos;m never going back there .
- You may want to go home some time .
wherever you go , you &apos;ll be tied to him . you &apos;ll never be free .
then it didn &apos;t do any good to run away .
it never does .
go back to Buenos Aires and get an annulment .
he left you right after the ceremony . there &apos;s nothing to it !
I &apos;ll be right by your side . I &apos;m a very good lawyer , you know .
I have more money than I can spend , and I &apos;m in love with you .
- Isn &apos;t that a terrific combination ?
- Yes , it is .
the plane leaves at two o &apos;clock . at two the next day you &apos;ll be free !
I didn &apos;t think I &apos;d ever trust another man , but here I go again .
thanks , Tom .
- Tom , this is the Hotel Centenario .
- I was told it &apos;s a good hotel .
I think it &apos;s wonderful .
- I &apos;ll do it .
- Your bags will be right up .
the light switch is here , if my memory doesn &apos;t fail me .
okay , Langford .
I &apos;ll do it anyway . I &apos;ll get an annulment !
- There &apos;s no annulment in Argentina .
- I &apos;ll get it anyway !
I will ! I &apos;ll get an annulment ! I will !
Johnny , please let me go .
I can &apos;t stand it anymore .
I don &apos;t want anything from you , but please , just let me go .
- Getting you here was a nice touch .
- About that night ...
I don &apos;t want to hear about that night . can &apos;t you understand ?
- I was waiting for you , Mr. Farrel . - Find anything interesting ?
close the joint up if it bothers you so much .
why do you think we allow the casino to stay open ?
you leave a purse-snatcher alone if he &apos;ll lead you to a bigger crime .
we know you run the monopoly . we want the names of the participants .
- I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re on about .
- I &apos;ll wait .
you &apos;re breaking up in little pieces . am I wearing you down ?
- You ?
- Something is .
I hadn &apos;t noticed ...
more !
I &apos;m not very good at zippers . maybe if I had some help ...
- I &apos;ll help you .
- I &apos;m an expert !
- I hate to do this , but Johnny ...
- Leave me alone !
- What is this ?
- Now they know what I am .
it &apos;s no use just you knowing it . now they know you got taken !
that he married a ...
the German has been arrested . he will talk .
all we want from you are the patents and the signed agreements .
we must know who the signers are to prosecute them for breaking the anti-trust laws .
you didn &apos;t hear a word of it . all you can think of is Gilda .
- You love each other terribly .
- I hate her !
that &apos;s what I mean . it &apos;s the oddest love / hate pattern I &apos;ve ever seen .
as long as you &apos;re sick in the head about her , you can &apos;t think clearly .
all right , you &apos;re under arrest for operating a gambling casino .
I &apos;ll let you stay here under protective custody .
send for me when you can &apos;t stand it anymore . I want those signatures .
I can out-wait you . I have the law on my side .
it &apos;s a very comfortable feeling . you ought to try it some time .
8 left , 24 right , 2 left , 17 right .
- You got that ?
- I got it .
there &apos;s everything in there you want , and nothing that I want .
no . that &apos;s at the casino , waiting .
when you sent for me , I sent for Gilda . she &apos;s going home .
- Home ? clear home ?
- At least you could wish her luck .
- She makes her own luck .
- How dumb can a man be ?
get out of here before you realise what a heel you &apos;ve been .
I can &apos;t bear to see you break down . I &apos;m a sensitive man , for a cop .
Gilda didn &apos;t do any of those things you &apos;ve been losing sleep over .
it was just an act , every bit of it .
but I &apos;ll give you credit , you were a great audience .
would you like a drink of ambrosia , suitable only for a goddess ?
no , thank you .
Mr. Obregon said the place had been taken over by the government .
don &apos;t think about it .
a cigarette , perhaps ?
Blended of the finest tobaccos from the most romantic places of the world .
no , thank you .
- It all looks lonely , doesn &apos;t it ?
- All bad things end up lonely .
I know that , don &apos;t I ?
you can keep your silly epigrams to yourself .
Uncle Pio .
I hear you &apos;re going home . I came to say goodbye .
I want to go with you , Gilda . please take me .
- I know I did everything wrong .
- Isn &apos;t it wonderful ?
nobody has to apologise , because we were both such stinkers .
- Isn &apos;t it wonderful ?
- Wonderful ...
I didn &apos;t intend to come back so soon , but I want my wife .
you thought I died that night . I murdered a man , so I disappeared for a while .
I came to the house to get Gilda .
I found her occupied with you . I had no time for an emotional scene .
I had a launch waiting for me . you didn &apos;t see me parachute out .
you weren &apos;t seeing very clearly that night . emotion clouds the brain .
I intended to kill you with this , to have one friend kill the other .
but now it won &apos;t do , because I have to kill Gilda , too .
I told you I &apos;d be looking ...
better get out of here , Uncle Pio , quick !
I &apos;m a great cop , and a pushover for a love story .
I know the combination of the safe , but I don &apos;t know where it is .
it &apos;s on the wall , behind the desk .
thanks . say , haven &apos;t I seen that cane somewhere before ?
Yes . you shouldn &apos;t leave such things lying around where I can reach them .
he &apos;s lying , like the gentleman I always said he was . it was I ...
- Keep your mouth shut !
- You two can quit being noble .
a man can only die once , and Mundson killed himself three months ago .
besides , didn &apos;t you ever hear of a thing called justifiable homicide ?
Johnny , let &apos;s go home . let &apos;s go home .
I owe everything to George Bailey .
help him , dear Father .
Joseph , Jesus and Mary , help my friend Mr. Bailey .
help my son George tonight .
he never thinks about himself , God .
that &apos;s why he &apos;s in trouble .
George is a good guy .
give him a break , God .
I love him , dear Lord .
watch over him tonight .
please , God .
something &apos;s the matter with Daddy .
please bring Daddy back .
please bring Daddy home .

Hello , Joseph . trouble ?
looks like we &apos;ll have to send someone down .
a lot of people asking for help for a man named George Bailey .
George Bailey ?
Yes . tonight &apos;s his crucial night . you &apos;re right .
we &apos;ll have to send someone down immediately . whose turn is it ?
that &apos;s why I came to see you , sir .
it &apos;s that clockmaker &apos;s turn again .
Oh , Clarence . hasn &apos;t got his wings yet , has he ?
we &apos;ve passed him up right along .
because , you know , sir , he &apos;s got the iq of a rabbit .
Yes , but he &apos;s got the faith of a child . simple .
Joseph , send for Clarence .
you sent for me , sir ?
Yes , Clarence . a man down on Earth needs our help .
Splendid. ls he sick ?
no , worse . he &apos;s discouraged .
at exactly 1 0 : 45 p.m. Earth time , that man will be thinking seriously of throwing away God &apos;s greatest gift .
Oh , dear , dear , his life ?
then I &apos;ve only an hour to dress .
what are they wearing now ?
you will spend that hour getting acquainted with George Bailey .
sir , if I should accomplish this mission , I mean , might I perhaps win my wings ?
I &apos;ve been waiting for over 200 years now , sir , and people are beginning to talk .
what &apos;s that book you &apos;ve got there ?
the Adventures of Tom Sawyer .
Clarence , you do a good job with George Bailey and you &apos;ll get your wings .
Oh , thank you , sir . thank you .
poor George .
sit down .
sit down ?
what are we ... lf you &apos;re going to help a man , you want to know something about him , don &apos;t you ?
well , naturally , of course . I ...
now , keep your eyes open .
see the town ?
where ?
I don &apos;t see a thing .
Oh , I forgot . you haven &apos;t got your wings yet .
now , look , I &apos;II help you out . concentrate .
begin to see something ?
why , yes . this is amazing .
if you ever get your wings , you &apos;II see all by yourself .
Oh , wonderful .
okay , boys , let &apos;s go .
Hey , who &apos;s that ?
that &apos;s your problem . George Bailey .
a boy ?
that &apos;s him when he was 12 back in 1919 .
something happens here you &apos;II have to remember later on .
come on , Marty .
let &apos;s go , Marty !
Attaboy , Marty .
let &apos;s go , Sam . Hee-haw , Sammy !
here comes the scare-baby , my kid brother Harry Bailey .
I &apos;m not scared .

-Come on , Harry !
-Come on , Harry !

-Help !
-Hang on , Harry !
-Help .
-Make a chain , gang .
George saved his brother &apos;s life that day , but he caught a bad cold which infected his left ear .
cost him his hearing in that ear .
it was weeks before he was able to go back to his after-schooI job at old man Gower &apos;s drugstore .
Mr. Potter .
who &apos;s that , a king ?
that &apos;s Henry F. Potter , the richest and meanest man in the county .
go to work , slave .
don &apos;t worry , we &apos;ll take care of it .
wish I had a million dollars .
hot dog !
it &apos;s me , Mr. Gower . George Bailey .
you &apos;re late .
Yes , sir .
Hello , George .
Hello , Mary .
Hello , Violet .
two cents &apos; worth of shoelaces ?
she was here first .
I &apos;m still thinking .
shoelaces ?
please , Georgie .
I like him .
you like every boy .
what &apos;s wrong with that ?
here you are .
help me down ?
help you down ?
made up your mind yet ?
I &apos;ll take chocolate .
-With coconuts ?
-l don &apos;t like coconuts .
you don &apos;t like coconuts ?
say , brainless , don &apos;t you know where coconuts come from ?
Lookit here .
from Tahiti , the Fiji islands , the Coral Sea .
a new magazine . I never saw it before .
of course you never . only us explorers can get it .
I &apos;ve been nominated for membership in the National Geographic Society .
is this the ear you can &apos;t hear on ?
George Bailey , I &apos;ll love you till the day I die .
I &apos;m going out exploring someday . you watch .
and I &apos;m gonna have a couple of harems and maybe three or four wives .
wait and see .
-George . George !
-Yes , sir ?
you &apos;re not paid to be a canary .
no , sir .
Mr. Gower , do you want something ? anything ?
no .
-Anything I can do back here ?
-No .
I &apos;ll get them , sir .
quick , take those capsules over to Mrs. Blaine .
she &apos;s waiting for them .
Yes , sir .
they have the diphtheria there , haven &apos;t they , sir ?
Yeah .
is it a charge , sir ?
Yes , George .
Mr. Gower , I ...
-Oh , get going .
-Yes , sir .
Avast there , Captain Cook . where you heading ?
-l &apos;ve got to see Pop , Uncle Billy .
-Some other time , George .
-lt &apos;s important .
-There &apos;s a squall in there .
it &apos;s shaping up into a storm .
-Uncle Billy , telephone .
-Who is it ?
-Bank examiner .
-Bank examiner ?
I should have called him yesterday .
switch it inside .
I &apos;m not crying , Mr. Potter .
well , you &apos;re begging . that &apos;s a whole lot worse .
all I &apos;m asking for is 30 days more .
-Pop .
-Just a minute , Son .
just 30 short days . I &apos;ll dig up that $ 5,000 somehow .
-Shove me up , shove me up .
-Pop .
-Just a minute .
-Have you put any real pressure on these people of yours to pay those mortgages ?
times are bad , Mr. Potter . a lot of these people are out of work .
well , then , foreclose .
I can &apos;t do that . these families have children .
-Pop .
-They &apos;re not my children .
but they &apos;re somebody &apos;s children , Mr. Potter .
are you running a business or a charity ward ?
-Well , all right ...
-Not with my money .
Mr. Potter , what makes you such a hard-skulled character ?
you have no family , no children .
you can &apos;t begin to spend all the money you &apos;ve got .
I suppose I should give it to miserable failures like you and that idiot brother of yours to spend for me .
he &apos;s not a failure !
-you can &apos;t say that about my father .
-George , George . quiet , George .
you &apos;re not . you &apos;re the biggest man in town ...
-Run along , run along .
- ... bigger than him ,
-bigger than everybody .
-Gives you an idea of the Baileys .
don &apos;t let him say that about you , Pop .
all right , Son . all right . thanks .
I &apos;ll talk to you tonight .
what ?
why , that medicine should have been there an hour ago .
it will be over in five minutes , Mrs. Blaine .
where &apos;s Mrs. Blaine &apos;s box of capsules ?
I ...
you ...
didn &apos;t you hear what I said ?
Yes , sir . I ...
what kind of tricks are you playing anyway ?
why didn &apos;t you deliver them right away ?
don &apos;t you know that boy &apos;s very sick ?
you &apos;re hurting my sore ear .
you lazy loafer .
Mr. Gower , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re doing .
you put something wrong in those capsules .
I know you &apos;re unhappy .
you got the telegram , and you &apos;re upset .
you put something bad in those capsules .
it wasn &apos;t your fault , Mr. Gower .
just look and see what you did .
the bottle you took the powder from , it &apos;s poison .
I tell you , it &apos;s poison .
I know you feel bad .
-Oh ! -Don &apos;t hurt my sore ear again !
-Don &apos;t hurt my sore ear again .
-Oh , no , no . Oh , George , George .
Oh , Mr. Gower , I won &apos;t ever tell anyone .
I know how you &apos;re feeling .
I won &apos;t ever tell a soul . hope to die , I won &apos;t .
Oh , George . George .
an overnight bag . genuine English cowhide .
combination lock .
-Fitted up with brushes , combs ... -Nope , nope , nope , nope .
now , look , Joe .
I want a big one .
what did you stop it for ?
I want you to take a good look at that face .
who is it ?
George Bailey .
Oh , you mean the kid that had his ears slapped back by the druggist ?
that &apos;s the kid .
it &apos;s a good face . I Iike it .
I like George Bailey .
tell me , did he ever tell anyone about the pills ?
not a soul .
did he ever marry the girl ?
did he ever go exploring ?
well , wait and see .
big , see ? I don &apos;t want one for one night .
I want something for 1 , 001 nights with plenty of room here for labels from Italy and Baghdad , Samarkand .
great big thing , about ...
-l see . a flying carpet , huh ?
-Yeah .
I don &apos;t suppose you &apos;d like this old secondhand job , would you ?
now you &apos;re talking .
gee whiz , I could use that as a raft in case the boat sunk .
-How much this cost ?
-No charge .
that &apos;s my trick ear , Joe . it sounded like you said &quot; no charge . &quot;
that &apos;s right .
well , what &apos;s my name doing on it ?
a little present from old man Gower . came down and picked it out himself .
he did ?
what do you know about that ? my old boss. lsn &apos;t that nice ?
what boat are you sailing on ?
I &apos;m working across on a cattle boat .
-a cattle boat ?
-Okay , I like cows .
Hello , Mr. Gower . how are you ?
thanks ever so much for the baggage . it &apos;s just exactly what I wanted .
forget it .
-lt &apos;s wonderful of you to think of me .
-Hope you enjoy it .
I wish I had a million dollars .
hot dog !
Avast there , Captain Cook !
-you got your sea legs yet ?
-Parlez-vous francais , mister ?
Hey , send us some of those picture postcards , will you , George ?
Hey , George , don &apos;t take any plug nickels .
Hey , George , your suitcase is leaking .
Hey , Ernie !
-Hi , Ernie . Hi , Bert .
-Hiya , George .
-George .
-Hey , I &apos;m a rich tourist today .
how about driving me home in style ?
-Hop in , Your Highness . hop in . -Yes , sir .
and for the carriage trade , I put on my hat .
good afternoon , Mr. Bailey .
Hello , Violet .
Hey , you look good . that &apos;s some dress you got on there .
this old thing ?
why , I only wear it when I don &apos;t care how I look .
-How would you like to take ...
-Yes .
want to come along , Bert ? we &apos;ll show you the town .
no , thanks .
I think I &apos;ll go home and see what the wife &apos;s doing .
family man .
George , Harry , you &apos;re shaking the house down .
stop it .
let them alone . I wish I was up there with them .
but Harry will tear his dinner suit . George !
that &apos;s why all children should be girls .
well , if they were all girls there wouldn &apos;t be any ...
Oh , never mind .
George , Harry , come down to dinner this minute .
everything &apos;s getting cold , and you know how long we &apos;ve been waiting for you .
-Okay , Ma . -Okay , Ma .
-we got a present for you , Pop .
-There you are .
Oh , you two idiots .
George , sit down and have dinner . -Fine .
-l &apos;ve eaten .
well , aren &apos;t you gonna finish dressing for your graduating party ? look at you !
I don &apos;t care. lt &apos;s George &apos;s tux .
Annie , my sweet , have you got those pies ?
if you lay a hand on me , I &apos;ll hit you with this broom !
Annie , I &apos;m in love with you . there &apos;s a moon out tonight .
boy , oh boy , oh boy ! my last meal in the old Bailey boarding house .
Oh , my lands , my blood pressure .
Pop , can I have the car ?
I gotta take over a lot of plates and things . what plates ?
mom , I &apos;m chairman of the Eats Committee .
we only need a couple of dozen .
Oh , no , you don &apos;t , Harry . now , not my best Haviland , no .
Oh , let him have the plates , Mother .
hope you have a good trip , George . Uncle Billy and I are gonna miss you .
I &apos;m gonna miss you , too , Pop .
what &apos;s the matter ? you look tired .
I had another tussle with Potter today .
I thought when we put him on the board of directors , he &apos;d ease up on us a little bit .
what &apos;s eating that old money-grubbing buzzard anyway ?
he &apos;s a sick man , frustrated , sick in his mind .
sick in his soul , if he has one .
he hates everybody that has anything that he can &apos;t have .
he hates us mostly , I guess .
Gangway . Gangway .
-So long , Pop .
-So long .
-you got a match ? -Very funny , very funny .
put those things in the car , and I &apos;ll get your tie and studs ready for you .
-Okay , Mom .
-Now , don &apos;t drop one of those .
you coming later , George ?
what do you mean , and be bored to death ?
couldn &apos;t want a better death .
lots of pretty girls , and we &apos;re gonna use that new floor tonight , too . -l hope it works .
-No gin tonight , Son .
Oh , Pop , just a little ?
no , Son . not one drop .
boys and girls and music .
why do they need gin ?
did I act like that when I graduated from high school ?
pretty much .
you know , George , I wish we could send Harry to college with you .
your mother and I talked it over half the night .
we have that all figured out .
you see , Harry will take my job at the Building and Loan , work there for four years , then he &apos;ll go .
pretty young for that job .
well , no younger than I was .
well , you were born older , George .
how &apos;s that ?
I said you were born older .
I suppose you &apos;ve decided what you want to do when you get out of college .
well , you know what I &apos;ve always talked about , build things , design new buildings , plan modern cities .
all that stuff I &apos;ve been talking about .
still after that first million before you &apos;re 30 ?
I &apos;ll settle for half that in cash .
of course , it &apos;s just a hope .
but you wouldn &apos;t consider coming back to the Building and Loan , would you ?
well , I ... I ...
Annie , why don &apos;t you draw up a chair ?
then you &apos;d be more comfortable , and you could hear everything that &apos;s going on .
I would if I thought I &apos;d hear anything worth listening to .
you would , eh ?
I know it &apos;s soon to talk about it .
no , now , Pop , I couldn &apos;t .
I couldn &apos;t face being cooped up for the rest of my life in a shabby little office .
I &apos;m sorry , Pop . I didn &apos;t mean that , but I ... lt &apos;s this business of nickels and dimes and spending all your life trying to figure out how to save three cents on a length of pipe .
I &apos;d go crazy . I want to do something big and something important .
you know , George , I feel that , in a small way , we &apos;re doing something important , satisfying a fundamental urge .
it &apos;s deep in the race for a man to want his own roof and walls and fireplace .
and we &apos;re helping him get those things in our shabby little office .
I know , Pop . I know that .
I wish I felt that ... I &apos;ve been hoarding pennies like a miser here in order to ...
most of my friends have already finished college .
I just feel like if I didn &apos;t get away , I &apos;d bust .
Yes , yes , you &apos;re right , Son .
you see what I mean , don &apos;t you , Pop ?
this town is no place for any man unless he &apos;s willing to crawl to Potter .
now , you &apos;ve got talent , Son . I &apos;ve seen it .
you get yourself an education and get out of here .
Pop , you want a shock ?
I think you &apos;re a great guy .
-Why , did you hear that , Annie ?
-l heard it .
it &apos;s about time one of you lunkheads said it .
I &apos;m gonna miss old Annie .
Pop , I think I &apos;ll get dressed and go over to Harry &apos;s party .
have a good time , Son .
excuse me .
there you are .
George , hello .
you know my kid brother George .
-l &apos;m gonna put him through college .
-Hello , George .
Hee-haw !
Sam Wainwright .
how are you ? when did you get here ?
this afternoon . I thought I &apos;d give the kids a treat .
old college graduate now .
Yeah , old &quot; Joe College &quot; Wainwright they call me .
well , freshman , looks like you &apos;re gonna make it after all , huh ?
-Harry , you &apos;re the guy I want to see .
-Hello , Sam .
-Coach has heard all about you .
-He has ?
Yeah , he &apos;s followed every game , and his mouth &apos;s watering .
he wants me to find out if you &apos;re gonna come along with us .
well , I got to make some dough first .
well , you better make it fast . we need great ends like you .
not broken down old guys like this one .
Hee-haw !
George , welcome back .
Hello , Mr. Partridge , how are you ?
putting a pool under this floor was a great idea .
saved us another building .
now , Harry , Sam , have a lot of fun .
there &apos;s lots of stuff here to eat and drink . lots of pretty girls around .
a third dance ... A third ...
-Hello , Violet .
-Hello . what am I bid ?
George .
Marty ! well , it &apos;s old home week .
-Marty !
-Sam , Harry , how are you ?
-Do me a favor , will you , George ?
-What &apos;s that ?
-you remember my kid sister Mary . -Oh , yeah .
Yeah .
&quot; mama wants you , Marty . mama wants you . &quot; remember ?
dance with her , will you ?
Oh , me ?
well , I feel funny enough already with all these kids .
come on , be a sport .
just dance with her one time , and you &apos;ll give her the thrill of her life . Hey , Sis !
don &apos;t be long , Marty .
I &apos;m not being a wet nurse to a ...
the next thing I knew , some guy came up and tripped me .
that &apos;s the reason why I came in fourth .
if it hadn &apos;t been for that , that race &apos;d have been a cinch .
I tried to find out who it was later , but I couldn &apos;t find out .
nobody &apos;d ever tell you whoever it was , because they &apos;d be scared .
&apos;Cause they know what kind of a guy I am .
you remember George . this is Mary .
well , I &apos;ll be seeing you .
well , well , well .
now to get back to my story , see ?
Hey , this is my dance .
why don &apos;t you stop annoying people ?
well , I &apos;m sorry . Hey !
-Well , hello .
-Hello .
you look at me as if you didn &apos;t know me .
well , I don &apos;t .
you &apos;ve passed me on the street almost every day .
me ?
no . that was a little girl named Mary Hatch .
that wasn &apos;t you .
Oh , yes ! Oh , yes ! Oh , yes !
the prize , a genuine loving cup .
those not tapped by the judges will remain on the floor .
let &apos;s go !
I &apos;m not very good at this .
neither am I .
okay . what can we lose ?
Hey , you &apos;re wonderful .
what &apos;s the matter , Othello ? jealous ?
did you know there &apos;s a swimming pool under this floor ?
and did you know that button behind you causes this floor to open up ?
and did you further know that George Bailey is dancing right over that crack ?
and I &apos;ve got the key .
stand back , everybody !
stand back !
they &apos;re cheering us . we must be good .
get out of there !
what ... Oh , well .
Buffalo gals can &apos;t you come out tonight ?
can &apos;t you come out tonight ?
Buffalo gals , can &apos;t you come out tonight
and dance
by the light
of the moon ?
-Oh , hot dog . just like an organ . -Beautiful .
I told Harry I thought I &apos;d be bored to death .
you should have seen the commotion in that locker room .
I had to knock down three people to get this stuff we &apos;re wearing here .
let me hold that old wet dress of yours .
do I look as funny as you do ?
I guess I &apos;m not quite the football type .
you look wonderful !
you know , if it wasn &apos;t me talking , I &apos;d say you were the prettiest girl in town .
well , why don &apos;t you say it ?
I don &apos;t know . maybe I will say it . how old are you anyway ?
Eighteen .
Eighteen ?
why , it was only last year you were seventeen .
too young or too old ?
Oh , no , no . just right . your age fits you .
Yes , sir , you look a little older without your clothes on .
I mean , without a dress you look older .
I mean younger . you look ...
you just ... I &apos;m on the thing here .
sir , my train , please .
a pox upon me for a clumsy lout .
your caboose , milady .
you may kiss my hand .
Hey , Mary .
as I was lumbering &apos; down the street
down the street , down the street
okay , then . I &apos;ll throw a rock at the old Granville house .
Oh , no , don &apos;t . I love that old house .
no , you see , you make a wish and then try and break some glass .
and you got to be a pretty good shot nowadays , too .
Oh , no , George , don &apos;t . it &apos;s full of romance , that old place .
I &apos;d like to live in it .
in that place ?
I wouldn &apos;t live in it as a ghost . now , watch .
right in the second floor , there . see ?
what did you wish , George ?
not just one wish , a whole hatful .
Mary , I know what I &apos;m gonna do tomorrow and the next day and next year and the year after that .
I &apos;m shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet , and I &apos;m gonna see the world !
Italy , Greece , the Parthenon , the Coliseum .
then I &apos;m coming back here and go to college to see what they know .
and then I &apos;m gonna build things .
I &apos;m gonna build airfields .
I &apos;m gonna build skyscrapers 1 00 stories high .
I &apos;m gonna build bridges a mile long .
what , are you gonna throw a rock ?
Hey , that &apos;s pretty good .
what did you wish , Mary ?
Buffalo gals can &apos;t you come out tonight ?
can &apos;t you come out tonight ?
Buffalo gals , can &apos;t you come out tonight
and
dance by the light of the moon ?
what did you wish when you threw that rock ?
-Oh , no .
-Come on , tell me .
if I told you , it might not come true .
what is it you want , Mary ?
what do you want ?
you want the moon ?
just say the word , and I &apos;ll throw a lasso around it and pull it down .
Hey , that &apos;s a pretty good idea . I &apos;ll give you the moon , Mary .
I &apos;ll take it .
then what ?
well , then you could swallow it , and it would all dissolve , see ?
and the moonbeams would shoot out of your fingers and your toes and the ends of your hair .
-Am I talking too much ?
-Yes !
why don &apos;t you kiss her instead of talking her to death ?
how &apos;s that ?
why don &apos;t you kiss her instead of talking her to death ?
you want me to kiss her , huh ?
youth is wasted on the wrong people .
Hey . Hey , hold on , hey , mister . come on back out here !
I &apos;ll show you some kissing that &apos;ll put hair back on your head . what are you ...
Mary ?
okay , I give up . where are you ?
over here in the hydrangea bushes .
here you are . catch .
wait a minute . what am I doing ?
this is a very interesting situation .
please give me my robe .
a man doesn &apos;t get in a situation like this every day .
I &apos;d like to have my robe .
not in Bedford Falls , anyway .
-Ouch ! Oh ! -Gesundheit .
-George Bailey !
-This requires a little thought here .
give me my robe .
I &apos;ve read about things like this , but I &apos;ve never ...
shame on you !
I &apos;m gonna tell your mother on you .
my mother &apos;s way up on the corner there .
I &apos;ll call the police .
they &apos;re way downtown . they &apos;d be on my side , too .
then I &apos;m going to scream !
maybe I could sell tickets .
let &apos;s see . no , the point is in order to get this robe ...
I &apos;ve got it .
I &apos;ll make a deal with you , Mary .
George ! George !
George , come on home !
quick !
-Your father &apos;s had a stroke .
-What ?
-Mary , Mary , I &apos;m sorry . I &apos;ve got to go .
-Come on , George , let &apos;s hurry .
-Did you get a doctor ? -Yes .
Campbell &apos;s there now .
I think that &apos;s all we &apos;ll need you for , George .
-l know you &apos;re anxious to make a train .
-l have a taxi waiting downstairs .
I want the board to know that George gave up his trip to Europe to help straighten things out here these past few months .
good luck to you at school , George .
-Good luck , George .
-Goodbye , George .
and now we come to the real purpose of this meeting , to appoint a successor to our dear friend Peter Bailey .
Mr. Chairman , I &apos;d like to get to my real purpose .
-Wait just a minute now .
-Wait for what ?
I claim this institution is not necessary to this town .
therefore , Mr. Chairman , I make a motion to dissolve this institution and turn its assets and liabilities over to the receiver .
Potter , you dirty , contemptible ...
I &apos;ll wring his neck .
George , did you hear what that buzzard ...
Mr. Chairman .
it &apos;s too soon after Peter Bailey &apos;s death to talk about chloroforming the Building and Loan .
Peter Bailey died three months ago .
I second Mr. Potter &apos;s motion .
very well. ln that case , I &apos;ll ask the two executive officers to withdraw .
but before you go , I &apos;m sure the whole board wishes to express its deep sorrow
-at the passing of Peter Bailey .
-Thank you very much .
it was his faith and devotion that are responsible for this organization .
I &apos;ll go further than that .
I &apos;ll say that to the public Peter Bailey was the Building and Loan .
that &apos;s fine , Potter , coming from you , considering that you probably drove him to his grave .
Peter Bailey was not a businessman .
that &apos;s what killed him .
Oh , I don &apos;t mean any disrespect to him . God rest his soul .
he was a man of high ideals , so-called .
but ideals without common sense can ruin this town .
now , you take this loan here to Ernie Bishop , you know , that fellow that sits around all day on his brains in his taxi , you know .
I happen to know the bank turned down this loan .
but he comes here , and we &apos;re building him a house worth $ 5,000 .
-Why ?
-Well , I handled that , Mr. Potter .
you have all the papers there . his salary , insurance .
I can personally vouch for his character .
-a friend of yours ?
-Yes , sir .
you see , if you shoot pool with some employee here , you can come and borrow money .
what does that get us ?
a discontented , lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class .
and all because a few starry-eyed dreamers like Peter Bailey stir them up and fill their heads with a lot of impossible ideas .
now , I say ...
just a minute . just a minute . now , hold on , Mr. Potter .
you &apos;re right when you say my father was no businessman . I know that .
why he ever started this cheap penny-ante Building and Loan l &apos;ll never know .
but neither you nor anybody else can say anything against his character , because his whole life was ...
why , in the 25 years since he and Uncle Billy started this thing , he never once thought of himself .
he didn &apos;t save enough money to send Harry to school , let alone me .
but he did help a few people get out of your slums , Mr. Potter .
and what &apos;s wrong with that ?
why , here , you &apos;re all businessmen here .
don &apos;t it make them better citizens , and doesn &apos;t it make them better customers ?
you said that they ...
what &apos;d you say just a minute ago ?
they had to wait and save their money before they even thought of a decent home .
wait ?
wait for what ?
until their children grow up and leave them ?
until they &apos;re so old and broken-down that they ...
do you know how long it takes a working man to save $ 5,000 ?
just remember this , Mr. Potter , that this rabble you &apos;re talking about , they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community .
well , is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath ?
anyway , my father didn &apos;t think so .
people were human beings to him , but to you , a warped , frustrated old man , they &apos;re cattle .
well , in my book , he died a much richer man than you &apos;ll ever be .
I &apos;m not interested in your book .
I &apos;m talking about the Building and Loan .
I know very well what you &apos;re talking about .
you &apos;re talking about something you can &apos;t get your fingers on , and it &apos;s galling you .
that &apos;s what you &apos;re talking about , I know .
well , I &apos;ve said too much . I ...
you &apos;re the Board here . you do what you want with this thing .
there &apos;s just one thing more , though .
this town needs this measly one-horse institution if only to have someplace where people can come without crawling to Potter .
come on , Uncle Billy .
sentimental hogwash . I want my motion .
boy , oh boy , that was telling him , George , old boy .
you shut his big mouth . you should have heard him .
what happened ?
we heard a lot of yelling .
well , we &apos;re being voted out of business after 25 years .
-Easy come , easy go .
-Here it is . &quot; help wanted . female . &quot;
you still want me to hang around , George ?
-Yeah , I &apos;ll be right down .
-Yeah , hey , you &apos;ll miss your train .
you &apos;re a week late for school already . go on .
-What &apos;s going on in there ?
-Never mind . don &apos;t worry about that .
they &apos;re putting us out of business . so what ?
I can get anotherjob .
-l &apos;m only 55 . -56 .
go on , go on . Hey , look , you gave up your boat trip , now you don &apos;t want to miss college , too , do you ?
George !
George ! they voted Potter down .
they want to keep it going .
you did it , George . you did it .
they got one condition , only one condition .
-What &apos;s that ?
-And that &apos;s the best part of it .
they &apos;ve appointed George here as Executive Secretary to take his father &apos;s place .
-Oh , no !
but , Uncle Billy ...
-you can keep him on . that &apos;s all right .
as Secretary , you can hire anyone you like .
Dr. Campbell , now let &apos;s get this thing straight . I &apos;m leaving .
I &apos;m leaving right now . I &apos;m going to school .
this is my last chance . Uncle Billy here , he &apos;s your man .
but , George , they &apos;ll vote with Potter otherwise .
-l know , I know , he didn &apos;t go .
-That &apos;s right .
not only that , but he gave his school money to his brother , Harry , and sent him to college .
Harry became a football star .
made second team all-American .
Yeah , but what happened to George ?
George got four years older , waiting for Harry to come back and take over the building and Loans .
there are plenty ofjobs around for somebody that likes to travel .
look at this . here .
Venezuela oil fields . &quot; wanted , man with construction experience . &quot;
here &apos;s the Yukon , right here .
&quot; wanted , man with engineering experience . &quot;
there she blows .
you know what the three most exciting sounds in the world are ?
breakfast is served . lunch is served . dinner ...
no , no , no , no !
anchor chains , plane motors and train whistles .
-Peanut ?
-There &apos;s the professor now .
old Professor Phi Beta Kappa all-American Bailey .
why , old George &quot; Geographic Explorer &quot; Bailey .
what ? no husky dogs ? no sled ?
Uncle Billy , you haven &apos;t changed a bit .
nobody ever changes here , you know that .
Oh , am I glad to see you .
-Say , where &apos;s Mother ?
-She &apos;s home , cooking the fatted calf .
-Come on , let &apos;s go .
-Oh , wait !
wait , wait a minute .
George , Uncle Billy , I want you to meet Ruth .
-Hello .
-How do you do ?
-Ruth Dakin .
-Ruth Dakin Bailey , if you don &apos;t mind .
-Huh ? -Well , I wired you I had a surprise .
here she is .
meet the wife .
well , what do you know ?
a wife .
-Well , how do you do ? congratulations .
-How do you do ?
what am I doing ?
congratulations !
-Doggone it , Harry , you ...
-They &apos;re married !
why don &apos;t you tell somebody ?
come on , Mrs. Bailey , I can &apos;t wait to see everybody &apos;s reaction .
-you &apos;re really married ?
-Why , yes .
what &apos;s a pretty girl like you doing marrying this two-headed brother of mine ?
well , I &apos;ll tell you. lt &apos;s purely mercenary . my father offered him a job .
Oh , he got you and the job ?
well , Harry &apos;s cup runneth over .
George , about that job . Ruth spoke out of turn . I never said I &apos;d take it .
you &apos;ve been holding the bag here for four years , and , well , I won &apos;t let you down , George .
Oh , wait a minute . I forgot the bags . I &apos;ll be right back .
it was a surprise to me .
this is the new Mrs. Bailey , my nephew &apos;s wife .
-How are you ?
-Old , old friend of the Baileys .
Oh , really ?
what are their names ?
Oh , of course , I &apos;ve heard him speak of you .
and I want to tell you , we &apos;re gonna give the biggest party this town ever saw .
here , have some popcorn .
George , George , George . that &apos;s all Harry ever talks about .
Ruth , this ...
what about this job ?
well , my father owns a glass factory in Buffalo .
he wants to get Harry started in the research business .
-Well , is it a good job ?
-Oh , yes , very .
not much money , but good future , you know .
-Yeah . -Harry &apos;s a genius at research .
-My fatherjust fell in love with him .
-And you did , too .
Hey , Joe .
Oh boy , oh boy , oh boy , oh boy . I feel so good .
I could spit in Potter &apos;s eye . I think I will . I think I will .
what did you say ? huh ?
maybe I &apos;d better go home .
where &apos;s my hat ?
where &apos;s my ...
-Oh , thank you , George .
which is mine ?
-The middle one .
Oh , thank you , George .
Oh boy , oh boy .
now , look , if you &apos;ll point me in the right direction ... Would you do that , George ?
right down here .
old Building and Loan pal , huh ?
now you just turn this way and then right straight down there .
Oh , that way , huh ?
my wild Irish rose l &apos;m all right . I &apos;m all right .
Hello , Ma .
that &apos;s for nothing .
-How do you like her ?
-She &apos;s swell , isn &apos;t she ?
looks like she can keep Harry on his toes .
keep him out of Bedford Falls , anyway .
did you know that Mary Hatch is back from school ?
came back three days ago .
nice girl , Mary .
kind that &apos;ll help you find the answers , George .
stop that grunting .
can you give me one good reason why you shouldn &apos;t call on Mary ?
sure .
Sam Wainwright .
-Hee-haw ? -Yes , Sam &apos;s crazy about Mary .
-Well , she &apos;s not crazy about him .
-Well , how do you know ?
-What , did she discuss it with you ?
-No .
-Well , then how do you know ?
-Well , I &apos;ve got eyes , haven &apos;t I ?
why , she lights up like a firefly whenever you &apos;re around .
besides , Sam Wainwright &apos;s away in New York ,
-and you &apos;re here in Bedford Falls .
-And all &apos;s fair in love and war .
I don &apos;t know about war .
mother of mine , I can see right through you right to your back-collar button .
trying to get rid of me , huh ?
well , here &apos;s your hat . what &apos;s your hurry ?
all right , Mother , old Building and Loan pal , I think I &apos;ll go out and find a girl and do a little passionate necking .
Oh , George .
now , if you &apos;ll just point me in the right direction ...
this direction .
good night , Mrs. Bailey .
-Excuse me .
-Now , wait a minute .
I think I got a date .
but stick around , fellows , just in case , huh ?
we &apos;ll wait for you , baby .
-Hello , Georgie Porgie !
-Hello Vi .
-What gives ?
-Nothing .
where are you going ?
Oh , I &apos;ll probably end up down at the library .
Georgie , don &apos;t you ever get tired ofjust reading about things ?
Yes .
-What are you doing tonight ?
-Not a thing .
are you game , Vi ?
let &apos;s make a night of it .
I &apos;d love it , Georgie . what &apos;ll we do ?
let &apos;s go out in the fields and take off our shoes
-and walk through the grass . -Huh ?
it &apos;s beautiful up there in the moonlight , and there &apos;s a green pool up there , and we can swim in it .
then we can climb Mount Bedford and smell the pines and watch the sunrise against the peaks , and we &apos;ll stay up there the whole night , and everybody &apos;ll be talking .
there &apos;ll be a terrific scandal .
Georgie , have you gone crazy ?
why , walk in the grass in my bare feet ?
why it &apos;s 1 0 miles up to Mount Bedford .
-lf you think ...
-Okay , just forget about the whole thing .
-What are you doing , picketing ?
-Hello , Mary .
I just happened to be passing by here .
Yes , so I noticed .
-Have you made up your mind ?
-How &apos;s that ?
-Have you made up your mind ?
-About what ?

-to pay me a visit .
-My motherjust called you ?

-When did you get back ?
-Tuesday .
where did you get that dress ?
-Do you like it ?
-lt &apos;s all right .
I thought you would go back to New York , like Sam and Angie and the rest of them .
I worked there a couple of vacations , but I don &apos;t know .
I guess I was homesick .
homesick ?
for Bedford Falls ?
Yes , and my family and ...
everything .
would you like to sit down ?
all right , for a minute .
I still can &apos;t understand it , though .
you know , I didn &apos;t tell anybody I was coming here .
would you rather leave ?
no . I don &apos;t want to be rude .
well , then , sit down .
what &apos;s that ?
some joke , huh ?

Oh , yeah , yeah , that &apos;s all right .

Oh , just marriage in general you &apos;re not enthusiastic about , huh ?

Mary ! Mary !

it &apos;s George Bailey , Mother .
George Bailey ?
what &apos;s he want ?
I don &apos;t know .
what do you want ?

George , do you remember that night in Martini &apos;s bar when you told me you &apos;d read someplace about making plastics out of soybeans ?
-Chili beans .
-Shut up , will you ?
you remember , out of chili ... Out of soybeans .
Yeah , yeah , yeah . soybeans , yeah .
well , listen , Dad snapped up the idea , and he &apos;s gonna build a factory outside of Rochester .
how do you Iike that ?
Rochester ?
well , why Rochester ?
well , why not ?
can you think of anything better ?
well , I don &apos;t know . just why not right here ?
you remember that old tool and machinery works ?
you tell your father he can get that for a song .
and all the labor he wants , too .
half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down .
that so ?
well , I &apos;ll tell him .
Hey , that sounds great .
Oh , baby , I knew you &apos;d come through .
now here &apos;s the point , Mary .
Mary , you &apos;re in on this , too .
now listen . have you got any money ?
money ? Yeah ...
well , a little .
well , now , listen .
I want you to put every cent you &apos;ve got into our stock , do you hear ?
and , George , I may have a job for you , that is unless you &apos;re still married to that broken-down building and Loan .
well , this is the biggest thing since radio , and I &apos;m letting you in on the ground floor .
Oh , Mary . Mary ?
I &apos;m here .
would you tell that guy
I &apos;m giving him the chance of a lifetime , do you hear ?
the chance of a lifetime !
he says it &apos;s the chance of a lifetime .
now you listen to me .
I don &apos;t want any plastics , and I don &apos;t want any ground floors .
and I don &apos;t want to get married , ever , to anyone .
you understand that ?
I want to do what I want to do .
and you &apos;re ... And you &apos;re ...
-Oh , Mary , Mary .
-George , George , George .

Goodbye , George !
Goodbye !
first Harry , now George .
Annie , we &apos;re just two old maids now .
you speak for yourself , Miss B .
if either of you two see a stranger around here , it &apos;s me .
Hey , look . there &apos;s somebody driving this cab .
Bert the cop sent this over .
he said to float away to Happyland on the bubbles .
Oh , look at this . old Bert . champagne !
by the way , where are you two going on this here now honeymoon ?
where are we going ?
look at this .
there &apos;s the kitty , Ernie .
here , come on , count it , Mary .
I feel like a bootlegger &apos;s wife . look .
you know what we &apos;re gonna do ?
we &apos;re gonna shoot the works .
a whole week in New York . a whole week in Bermuda .
the highest hotels , the oldest champagne , the richest caviar , the hottest music and the prettiest wife .
that does it !
then what ?
-Then what , honey ? -After that , who cares ?
that does it , come here . come here .
don &apos;t look now , but there &apos;s something funny going on over there at the bank , George .
I &apos;ve never really seen one , but that &apos;s got all the earmarks of being a run .
Hey , Ernie , if you got any money in the bank , you better hurry .
George , let &apos;s not stop . let &apos;s go !
just a minute , dear .
-Please , let &apos;s not stop , George .
-l &apos;ll be back in a minute , Mary .
well , hello , everybody . Mrs. Thompson , how are you ?
Charlie ? what &apos;s the matter here , can &apos;t you get in ?
what is this , Uncle Billy ?
a holiday ?
George .
come on in , everybody . that &apos;s right . just come on in .
look out , you .
now , look , why don &apos;t you all sit down ?
there are a lot of seats over there .
just make yourselves at home .
George , can I see you a minute ?
-Why didn &apos;t you call me ?
-l just did , but they said you left .
this is a pickle , George . this is a pickle .
all right , now , what happened ?
how did it start ?
how does a thing like this ever start ?
-All I know is the bank called our loan .
-When ?
about an hour ago . I handed over all our cash .
-All of it ?
-Every cent of it ,
-and still it was less than we owe them .
-Holy mackerel !
and then I got scared , George , and closed the doors .
I ... I ...
the whole town &apos;s gone crazy .
Yeah , hello ?
George , it &apos;s Potter .
Hello ?
George , there is a rumor around town that you &apos;ve closed your doors .
is that true ?
Oh , well , I &apos;m very glad to hear that .
George , are you all right ?
do you need any police ?
police ? what for ?
well , mobs get pretty ugly sometimes , you know .
George , I &apos;m going all out to help in this crisis .
I &apos;ve just guaranteed the bank sufficient funds to meet their needs .
they &apos;ll close up for a week and then reopen .
he just took over the bank .
I may lose a fortune , but I &apos;m willing to guarantee your people , too .
just tell them to bring their shares over here , and I will pay 50 cents on the dollar .
you never miss a trick , do you , Potter ?
well , you &apos;re gonna miss this one .
if you close your doors before 6 : 00 p.m. , you will never reopen .
George , was it a nice wedding ?
gosh , I wanted to be there .
Yeah .
you can take this one off now .
now , just remember that this thing isn &apos;t as black as it appeared .
I have some news for you , folks .
I was just talking to old man Potter , and he &apos;s guaranteed cash payments at the bank .
the bank &apos;s gonna reopen next week .
but , George , I got my money here .
did he guarantee this place ?
well , no , Charlie . I didn &apos;t even ask him . we don &apos;t need Potter over here .
then , I &apos;ll take mine now .
no , but you &apos;re ...
you &apos;re thinking of this place all wrong , as if I had the money back in a safe .
the money &apos;s not here .
well , your money &apos;s in Joe &apos;s house . that &apos;s right next to yours .
and in the Kennedy house and Mrs. Macklin &apos;s house and 1 00 others .
why , you &apos;re lending them the money to build , and then , they &apos;re gonna pay it back to you as best they can .
now , what are you gonna do , foreclose on them ?
I got $ 242 in here , and $ 242 isn &apos;t going to break anybody .
okay , Tom . all right .
here you are . you sign this . you &apos;ll get your money in 60 days .
Sixty days ?
now , that &apos;s what you agreed to when you bought your shares .
-Tom !
Tom , did you get your money ?
-No .
well , I did .
old man Potter &apos;ll pay 50 cents on the dollar for every share you &apos;ve got .
-Fifty cents on the dollar !
-Yes , cash !
well , what do you say ?
now , Tom , you have to stick to your original agreement .
now , give us 60 days on this .
-Okay , Randall .
-Are you going to go to Potter &apos;s ?
better to get half than nothing .
Tom ! Tom !
Randall ! now , Randall , wait !
wait .
now , listen . now , listen to me . I beg of you not to do this thing .
if Potter gets a hold of this Building and Loan , there &apos;ll never be another decent house built in this town .
he &apos;s already got charge of the bank .
he &apos;s got the bus line . he got the department stores .
and now he &apos;s after us . why ? well , it &apos;s very simple .
because we &apos;re cutting in on his business , that &apos;s why .
and because he wants to keep you living in his slums and paying the kind of rent he decides .
Joe , you had one of those Potter houses , didn &apos;t you ?
well , have you forgotten ?
have you forgotten what he charged you for that broken-down shack ?
here , Ed , you know . you remember last year when things weren &apos;t going so well and you couldn &apos;t make your payments .
well , you didn &apos;t lose your house , did you ?
you think Potter would &apos;ve let you keep it ?
can &apos;t you understand what &apos;s happening here ?
don &apos;t you see what &apos;s happening ?
Potter isn &apos;t selling . Potter &apos;s buying , and why ?
because we &apos;re panicky and he &apos;s not .
he &apos;s picking up some bargain .
now we can get through this thing all right .
we &apos;ve got to stick together , though .
we &apos;ve got to have faith in each other .
but my husband hasn &apos;t worked in over a year , and I need money .
how am going to live until the bank opens ?
-l got doctor bills to pay .
-l need cash .
I can &apos;t feed my kids on faith .
how much do you need ?
Hey ! I got $ 2,000 .
here &apos;s $ 2,000 . this &apos;ll tide us over till the bank reopens .

Hey , this is the company &apos;s posters , and the company won &apos;t like this .

-Sure , I had it , but I got rid of it .

Hiya ...
good evening , sir .
welcome home , Mr. Bailey .
well , I &apos;ll be ...
Mary . Mary , where did you ...
Oh , Mary .
remember the night we broke some windows in this old house ?
this is what I wished for .
you &apos;re wonderful .
-Martini , you rented a new house ?
-Rent ?
-you hear what he say , Mr. Bailey ?
-What &apos;s that ?
I own the house .
me , Giuseppe Martini , I own my own house .
no more we live like a pigs in this Potter &apos;s Field .
-Mary , Mary !
-Mary , come on , bring the baby .
I feel like a queen .
-l &apos;ll take the kids in the car .
-Oh , thank you , Mr. Bailey . thank you .
all right , kids , here . here , get in here .
now , one at a time . get right up on the seat there .
-Sit down , there .
-Here , now , get the dog , now . that &apos;s it .
-Goat , too .
-Everybody !
all in !
Bye-bye !
Bye-bye !
all in ?
Mr. and Mrs. Martini , welcome home .
good old George , he &apos;s always making a speech .
-Sam Wainwright .
-Oh , who cares .
bread . that this house may never know hunger .
salt . that life may always have flavor .
and wine . that joy and prosperity may reign forever .
enter the Martini castle .
look , Mr. Potter , it &apos;s no skin off my nose .
I &apos;m just your little rent collector .
but you can &apos;t laugh off this Bailey Park anymore .
look at it .
Congressman Black is here to see you , sir .
Oh , tell the Congressman to wait . go on .
fifteen years ago , a half a dozen houses stuck here and there .
there &apos;s the old cemetery , squirrels , buttercups , daisies .
I used to hunt rabbits there myself .
look at it today .
dozens of the prettiest little homes you ever saw , 90 % owned by suckers who used to pay rent to you .
your Potter &apos;s Field , my dear Mr. Employer , is becoming just that .
and are the local yokels making with those David and Goliath wisecracks .
Oh , they are , are they ?
even though they know the Baileys never made a dime out of it .
you know very well why . the Baileys were all chumps .
every one of these homes is worth twice what it cost the Building and Loan to build .
-lf l were you , Mr. Potter ...
-you are not me .
as I say , it &apos;s no skin off my nose ,
but one of these days this bright young man is gonna be asking George Bailey for a job .
the Bailey family has been a boil on my neck long enough .
-Yes , sir ?
-Come in here .
we just stopped in town to take a look at the new factory , and then we &apos;re gonna drive on down to Florida .
why don &apos;t you have your friends join us ?
why , sure . Hey , why don &apos;t you kids drive down with us , huh ?
Oh , I &apos;m afraid I couldn &apos;t get away , Sam .
still got the nose to the old grindstone , eh ?
Jane , I offered to let George in on the ground floor in plastics , and he turned me down cold .
-Oh , now , don &apos;t rub it in .
-l &apos;m not rubbing it in .
well , I guess we better run along .
-Awfully happy to have met you , Mary .
-Nice meeting you , too .
-Goodbye . glad to see you .
-Goodbye , George .
so long , George .
see you in the funny papers .
-So long , Mary .
-Bye , Sam . have fun .
-Thanks for dropping around .
-Florida !
thank you , sir .
-That &apos;s quite a cigar , Mr. Potter .
-you like it ?
I &apos;ll send you a box .
well , I ... I suppose I &apos;ll find out sooner or later , but just what exactly did you want to see me about ?
George , now that &apos;s just what I like so much about you .
George , I am an old man , and most people hate me .
but I don &apos;t like them , either , so that makes it all even .
you knowjust as well as I do that I run practically everything in this town but the Bailey Building and Loan .
you know , also , that for a number of years I &apos;ve been trying to get control of it .
or kill it . but I haven &apos;t been able to do it .
you have been stopping me .
in fact , you have beaten me , George , and as anyone in this county can tell you , that takes some doing .
take during the Depression , for instance .
you and I were the only ones that kept our heads .
you saved the Building and Loan . I saved all the rest .
Yes . well , most people say you stole all the rest .
the envious ones say that , George , the suckers .
now , I have stated my side very frankly .
now let &apos;s look at your side .
young man , 27-28 , married , making , say , $ 40 a week .
- $ 45 .
out of which , after supporting your mother and paying your bills , you &apos;re able to keep , say , $ 1 0 , if you skimp .
a child or two comes along , and you won &apos;t even be able to save the $ 1 0 .
now , if this young man of 28 was a common , ordinary yokel , I &apos;d say he was doing fine .
but George Bailey is not a common , ordinary yokel .
he is an intelligent , smart , ambitious young man , who hates his job , who hates the Building and Loan almost as much as I do .
a young man who &apos;s been dying to get out on his own ever since he was born .
a young man ... The smartest one of the crowd , mind you .
a young man who has to sit by and watch his friends go places because he &apos;s trapped .
Yes , sir , trapped into frittering his life away , playing nursemaid to a lot of garlic eaters .
do I paint a correct picture , or do I exaggerate ?
-Now , what &apos;s your point , Mr. Potter ?
-My point ?
-My point is I want to hire you .
-Hire me ?
Yeah , I want you to manage my affairs , run my properties .
George , I &apos;ll start you out at $ 20,000 a year .
$ 20,000 a year ?
you wouldn &apos;t mind living in the nicest house in town , buying your wife a lot of fine clothes , a couple of business trips to New York a year , maybe once in a while Europe .
you wouldn &apos;t mind that , would you , George ?
would I ?
you &apos;re not talking to somebody else around here , are you ?
you know , this is me . you remember me ?
-George Bailey .
-George Bailey .
Yeah , George Bailey , whose ship has just come in .
provided he has enough brains to climb aboard .
holy mackerel .
well , how about the Building and Loan ?
Oh , confound it , man , are you afraid of success ?
I &apos;m offering you a three-years contract at $ 20,000 a year , starting today .
is it a deal , or isn &apos;t it ?
well , Mr. Potter , I ... I know I ought to jump at the chance but I ...
I just ... I wonder if it would be possible for you to give me 24 hours to think it over ?
sure , sure , sure .
you go on home and talk about it to your wife .
I &apos;d like to do that .
Yeah. ln the meantime , I &apos;ll draw up the papers .
-All right , sir .
-Okay , George ?
okay , Mr. Potter .
no . no . no , no , now wait a minute , here .
I don &apos;t need 24 hours . I don &apos;t have to talk to anybody .
I know right now , and the answer is no . no , doggone it !
you sit around here , and you spin your little webs , and you think the whole world revolves around you and your money .
well , it doesn &apos;t , Mr. Potter .
in the whole vast configuration of things , I &apos;d say you were nothing but a scurvy little spider .
you ...
and that goes for you , too !
and it goes for you , too !
you wouldn &apos;t mind living in the nicest house in town , buying your wife a Iot of fine clothes , going to New York on a business trip a couple of times a year , maybe Europe once in a while .
I know what I &apos;m gonna do tomorrow and the next day and next year and the year after that .
I &apos;m shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet , and I &apos;m gonna see the world .
and then I &apos;m gonna build things . I &apos;m gonna build air fields .
I &apos;m gonna build skyscrapers 100 stories high .
I &apos;m gonna build a bridge a mile long .
what is it you want , Mary ?
what , you want the moon ?
if you do , just say the word , I &apos;ll throw a lasso around it and pull her down for you .
Buffalo gal Won &apos;t you come out tonight ?
won &apos;t you come out tonight ? won &apos;t you come out tonight ?
Buffalo gal Won &apos;t you come out tonight

-What is it , a sore throat or what ?
-lt &apos;s just a cold .
-The doctor says it &apos;s nothing serious .
-The doctor ?
-Was the doctor here ?
-Yes , I called him right away .
he says it &apos;s nothing to worry about .
is she running a temperature ? what is it ?
just a teensy one , 99.6 . she &apos;ll be all right .
of course , it &apos;s this old house .
I don &apos;t know why we don &apos;t all have pneumonia .
drafty old barn . might as well be living in a refrigerator .
why did we have to live here in the first place and stay around this measly , crummy old town ?
-George , what &apos;s wrong ? -Wrong !
everything &apos;s wrong .
you call this a happy family ?
why do we have to have all these kids ?
-Dad , how do you spell &quot; frankincense &quot; ?
-l don &apos;t know . ask your mother .
-Where &apos;re you going ?
-l &apos;m going up to see Zuzu .

-Telephone ! -Telephone !
I &apos;ll get it .
Hello ?
Yes , this is Mrs. Bailey .
Oh , thank you , Mrs. Welch . I &apos;m sure she &apos;ll be all right .

let me speak to her .
Hello . Hello , Mrs. Welch ?
this is George Bailey . I &apos;m Zuzu &apos;s father .
say , what kind of a teacher are you , anyway ?
what do you mean sending her home like that , half naked ?
do you realize she &apos;ll probably end up with pneumonia on account of you ?
-ls this the sort of thing we pay taxes for to have teachers like you ?
stupid , silly , careless people who send our kids home without any clothes on ?
you know , maybe my kids aren &apos;t the best-dressed kids .
and maybe they don &apos;t have any decent clothes ...
that stupid ...
Hello , Mrs. Welch . I want to apologize ...
Hello ? Hello .
-She &apos;s hung up !
-l &apos;ll hang her up !
-Hey , you !
I &apos;II knock your block off !
-What is that ?
Hello !

Oh , Mr. Welch ?

-Shall I pray for him ?
-Yes , Janie , pray very hard .
-Me , too ?

Hello ?
Uncle Billy ?
I &apos;m in trouble , Mr. Potter .
I need help .
through some sort of an accident , my company &apos;s short in their accounts .
the bank examiner got there today .
I &apos;ve got to raise $ 8,000 immediately .
Oh , that &apos;s what the reporters wanted to talk to you about ?
-The reporters ?
-Yes .
they called me up from your Building and Loan .
Oh , there &apos;s a man over there from the D.A. &apos; s office , too .
he &apos;s looking for you .
please help me , Mr. Potter . help me , won &apos;t you , please ?
can &apos;t you see what it means to my family ?
I &apos;ll pay any sort of a bonus on the loan , any interest , if you still want the Building and Loan ...
George , could it possibly be there &apos;s a slight discrepancy in the books ? no , sir .
there &apos;s nothing wrong with the books .
I &apos;ve just misplaced $ 8,000 . I can &apos;t find it anywhere .
-you misplaced $ 8,000 ?
-Yes , sir .
-Have you notified the police ?
-No , sir . I didn &apos;t want the publicity .
-Harry &apos;s homecoming tomorrow ...
-They &apos;re going to believe that one .
what &apos;ve you been doing , George ?
playing the market with the company &apos;s money ?
no , sir . no , sir , I haven &apos;t .
is it a woman , then ?
you know , it &apos;s all over town that you &apos;ve been giving money to Violet Bick .
what ?
not that it makes any difference to me , but why did you come to me ?
why don &apos;t you go to Sam Wainwright and ask him for the money ?
I can &apos;t get a hold of him . he &apos;s in Europe .
well , what about all your other friends ?
they don &apos;t have that kind of money , Mr. Potter . you know that .
you &apos;re the only one in town that can help me .
I &apos;ve suddenly become quite important .
what kind of security would I have , George ?
-Have you got any stocks ?
-No , sir .
bonds ? real estate ?
collateral of any kind ?
I have some life insurance , a $ 1 5,000 policy .
-Yes . how much is your equity in it ?
-Five hundred dollars .
five hundred dollars ?
and you ask me to lend you $ 8,000 ?
look at you . you used to be so cocky .
you were going to go out and conquer the world .
you once called me a warped , frustrated old man .
what are you but a warped , frustrated young man ?
a miserable little clerk , crawling in here on your hands and knees and begging for help .
no securities , no stocks , no bonds .
nothing but a miserable little $ 500 equity in a life insurance policy .
you &apos;re worth more dead than alive .
why don &apos;t you go to the riffraff you love so much and ask them to let you have $ 8,000 ?
you know why ?
because they &apos;d run you out of town on a rail .
but I tell you what I &apos;m going to do for you , George .
since the state examiner is still here , as a stockholder of the Building and Loan , I &apos;m going to swear out a warrant for your arrest .
Misappropriation of funds , manipulation , malfeasance .
all right , George , go ahead .
you can &apos;t hide in a little town like this .
Yeah , Bill ?
this is Potter .
merry Christmas !
glad you come !
how about some of that good spaghetti ?
we got everything .
Oh , God .
dear Father in Heaven ,
I &apos;m not a praying man , but if you &apos;re up there and you can hear me ,
show me the way .
I &apos;m at the end of my rope . I ...
show me the way , O God .
are you all right , George ?
want somebody to take you home ?
why you drink so much , my friend ?
please go home , Mr. Bailey . this is Christmas Eve .
Bailey ?
which Bailey ?
this is Mr. George Bailey .
the next time you talk to my wife like that , you &apos;ll get worse !
she cried for an hour !
it isn &apos;t enough she slaves teaching your stupid kids how to read and write ,
-and you have to bawl her out .
-you get out of here , Mr. Welch !
now , wait , I want to pay for my drink .
never mind the money !
you get out of here quick !
-All right !
-you hit my best friend !

-you all right , George ?
-Who was that ?
he gone . no worry . he name is Welch .
-He no come into my place no more .
-Oh , Welch .
that &apos;s what I get for praying .
the last time he come in here . you hear that , Nick ?
Yes , you bet .
where &apos;s my insurance policy ?
Oh , here it is .
Oh , no , please , don &apos;t go this way , Mr. Bailey .
-l &apos;m all right .
-No , no , you no feel so good .
-Sit down and rest .
-l &apos;m all right .
please no go away , please !
what do you think you &apos;re doing ?
now look what you did .
my great-grandfather planted this tree !
Hey , you ! Hey , you !
come back here , you drunken fool !
get this car out of here !
Hey , what &apos;s the matter with you ?
look where you &apos;re going .
help !
help !
help !
help !
help ! help ! help !
help !
help !
help !
I didn &apos;t have time to get some stylish underwear .
wife gave me this on my last birthday .
I passed away in it .
Oh , Tom Sawyer &apos;s drying out , too .
you should read the new book Mark Twain &apos;s writing now .
how did you happen to fall in ?
I didn &apos;t fall in . I jumped in to save George .
you what ?
to save me ?
well , I did , didn &apos;t I ?
you didn &apos;t go through with it , did you ?
-Go through with what ?
-Suicide .
it &apos;s against the law to commit suicide around here .
Yeah , it &apos;s against the law where l come from , too .
-Where do you come from ?
-Heaven .
I had to act quickly . that &apos;s why I jumped in .
I knew if I were drowning , you &apos;d try to save me .
you see , you did , and that &apos;s how I saved you .
very funny .
your lip &apos;s bleeding , George .
Yeah , I got a bust in the jaw in answer to a prayer a little bit ago .
Oh , no , no , no , George , I &apos;m the answer to your prayer .
that &apos;s why I was sent down here .
-How &apos;d you know my name ?
-Oh , I know all about you .
I &apos;ve watched you grow up from a little boy .
what are you , a mind reader or something ?
no .
-Well , who are you then ?
-Clarence Oddbody , AS2 .
Oddbody ?
AS2 ?
what &apos;s that , AS2 ?
angel Second Class .
Cheerio , my good man .
Oh , brother .
I wonder what Martini put in those drinks .
Hey , what &apos;s with you ? what did you say just a minute ago ?
why &apos;d you want to save me ?
that &apos;s what I was sent down for . I &apos;m your guardian angel .
I wouldn &apos;t be a bit surprised .
ridiculous of you to think of killing yourself for money , $ 8,000 .
Yeah , now , just things like that ... How do you know that ?
I told you . I &apos;m your guardian angel . I know everything about you .
well , you look about like the kind of an angel I &apos;d get .
sort of a fallen angel , aren &apos;t you ?
what happened to your wings ?
I haven &apos;t won my wings yet . that &apos;s why I &apos;m an Angel Second Class .
I don &apos;t know whether I &apos;d like it very much being seen around with an angel without any wings .
Oh , I &apos;ve got to earn them , and you &apos;ll help me , won &apos;t you ?
sure , sure .
-How ?
-By letting me help you .
Yes . only one way you can help me .
you don &apos;t happen to have 8,000 bucks on you , do you ?
Oh , no . no . we don &apos;t use money in heaven .
Oh , yeah , that &apos;s right , I keep forgetting .
-Comes in pretty handy down here , bub . -Oh , tut , tut , tut .
I found it out a little late .
I &apos;m worth more dead than alive .
now , look , you mustn &apos;t talk like that . I won &apos;t get my wings with that attitude .
you just don &apos;t know all that you &apos;ve done . if it hadn &apos;t been for you ...
Yeah , if it hadn &apos;t been for me , everybody &apos;d be a lot better off .
my wife and my kids and my friends .
I mean , look , little fellow , go off and haunt somebody else , will you ?
no , now , you don &apos;t understand . I &apos;ve got my job ...
Oh , shut up , will you ?
Oh , this isn &apos;t gonna be so easy .
Yeah , so you still think killing yourself would make everyone feel happier , eh ?
well , I don &apos;t know . I guess you &apos;re right .
I suppose it would have been better if I &apos;d never been born at all .
-What &apos;d you say ?
-l said I wish I &apos;d never been born .
Oh , you mustn &apos;t say things like that .
you ... Wait a minute .
wait a minute . that &apos;s an idea .
what do you think ?
Yeah , that &apos;ll do it .
all right .
you &apos;ve got your wish . you &apos;ve never been born .
you don &apos;t have to make all that fuss about it !
what did you say ?
you &apos;ve never been born . you don &apos;t exist . you haven &apos;t a care in the world .
no worries , no obligations , no $ 8,000 to get , no Potter looking for you with the Sheriff .
-Say something else in that ear .
-Sure , you can hear out of it .
well , that &apos;s the doggonedest thing .
I haven &apos;t heard anything out of that ear since I was a kid .
must have been that jump in that cold water .
your lip stopped bleeding , too , George .
what do you know about that ?
what &apos;s happening ?
it stopped snowing out here , didn &apos;t it ?
what &apos;s happened here ?
what I need is a couple of good stiff drinks .
how about you , Angel ? you want a drink ?
come on , soon as these clothes of ours are dry ...
the clothes are dry .
what do you know about that ? stove &apos;s hotter than I thought .
now , come on , get your clothes on . we &apos;ll stroll up to my car and get ...
Oh , I &apos;m sorry . I &apos;ll stroll . you fly .
I can &apos;t fly . I haven &apos;t got my wings .
you haven &apos;t got your wings . Yeah , that &apos;s right .
what &apos;s the matter ?
well , this is where l left my car , and it isn &apos;t here .
-you have no car .
-Well , I had a car , and it was right here .
I guess somebody moved it .
-Good evening .
-Oh , say , hey , where &apos;s my car ?
-l beg your pardon ?
-My car , my car .
I &apos;m the fellow that owns the car that ran into your tree .
-What tree ?
-What do you mean , what tree ?
this tree . here , I ran into it .
cut a big gash in the side of it there .
you must mean two other trees . you had me worried .
one of the oldest trees in Pottersville .
Pottersville ?
why , you mean Bedford Falls .
I mean Pottersville . don &apos;t you think I know where l live ?
what &apos;s the matter with you ?
what &apos;s the matter with me ?
well , I guess I just ...
Oh , I don &apos;t know . either I &apos;m off my nut or he is or you are .
it isn &apos;t me .
well , maybe I left the car up at Martini &apos;s .
-Well , come on , Gabriel .
-Clarence .
Clarence . Clarence .
that &apos;s all right . go on in . Martini is a friend of mine .
there &apos;s a place to sit down . sit down .
-Oh , hello , Nick .
Hey , where &apos;s Martini ? -Want a martini ?
no , no , Martini . your boss . where is he ?
Hey , look , I &apos;m the boss . you want a drink or don &apos;t you ?
okay , all right . double bourbon , will you , and quick , huh ?
okay .
-What &apos;s yours ?
-l was just thinking .
it &apos;s been so long since I ...
look , mister , I &apos;m standing here waiting for you to make up your mind .
that &apos;s a good man .
I was just thinking of a flaming rum punch .
no , it &apos;s not cold enough for that , not nearly cold enough .
wait a minute . wait a minute . I got it .
Mulled wine , heavy on the cinnamon and light on the cloves .
off with you , me lad , and be lively !
Hey , look , mister , we serve hard drinks in here for men who want to get drunk fast .
and we don &apos;t need any characters around to give the joint atmosphere .
is that clear , or do I have to slip you my left for a convincer ?
what &apos;s he talking about ?
Nick , Nick , just give him the same as mine .
-He &apos;s okay .
-Okay .
what &apos;s the matter with him ?
I never saw Nick act like that before .
you &apos;ll see a lot of strange things from now on .
Oh , yeah .
Hey , little fellow , you worry me , you know .
-you got someplace to sleep ?
-No .
you don &apos;t , huh ?
-Well , you got any money ?
-No .
no wonder you jumped in the river .
I jumped in the river to save you so I could get my wings .
-Somebody &apos;s just made it .
-Made what ?
every time you hear a bell ring , it means that some angel &apos;s just got his wings .
look , I think maybe you better not mention getting your wings around here .
why ?
don &apos;t they believe in angels ?
Yeah , they believe in them .
Oh , why should they be surprised when they see one ?
-Two hundred and ninety-three , next May .
-How old are you anyway , Clarence ?
that does it . out , you two pixies !
go through the door or out the window .
-Look , Nick , what &apos;s wrong ?
-Now , that &apos;s another thing .
where do you come off calling me Nick ?
well , Nick , that &apos;s your name .
what &apos;s that got to do with it ?
I don &apos;t know you from Adam &apos;s off ox .
Hey . Hey , you rummy , there . come here , come here .
didn &apos;t I tell you never to come panhandling around here , huh ?
Mr. Gower .
what ... What did ...
Mr. Gower , look , this is George Bailey .
-Don &apos;t you know me ?
-No .
no .
throw him out . throw him out .
Mr. Gower !
Hey , what is ...
Hey , Nick . Nick . isn &apos;t that Mr. Gower , the druggist ?
you know , that &apos;s another reason for me not to like you .
that rum head spent 20 years in jail for poisoning a kid .
if you know him , you must be a jailbird yourself .
would you show these gentlemen to the door ?
sure . this way , gentlemen .
stay out .
get me ! I &apos;m giving out wings !
you see , George , you were not there to stop Gower from putting that poison into the capsules .
what do you mean , I wasn &apos;t there ?
I remember distinctly ...
Hey , what &apos;s going on around here ?
what ...
why , this ought to be Martini &apos;s place .
look , who are you ?
I told you , George . I &apos;m your guardian angel .
Yeah , yeah , I know . you told me that .
what else are you ?
what , are you a hypnotist ?
no . of course not .
well , then , why am I seeing all these strange things here ?
don &apos;t you understand , George ?
it &apos;s because you were not born .
-Well , if I wasn &apos;t born , who am I ?
-you &apos;re nobody . you have no identity .
what do you mean , no identity ?
my name &apos;s George Bailey .
there is no George Bailey .
you have no papers , no cards , no driver &apos;s license , no 4-F card , no insurance policy .
they &apos;re not there , either .
-What ?
-Zuzu &apos;s petals .
you &apos;ve been given a great gift , George , a chance to see what the world would be like without you .
now , wait a minute here .
wait a minute here .
this is some sort of a funny dream I &apos;m having .
so long , mister . I &apos;m going home .
-Home ?
what home ?
-Shut up !
cut it out !
you &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s what I think .
you &apos;re screwy .
you &apos;re driving me crazy , too . I &apos;m seeing things here .
I &apos;m going home and see my wife and family .
you understand that ?
and I &apos;m going home alone .
how am I doing , Joseph ?

no , I didn &apos;t have a drink .
Hey , hey , where did the Building and Loan move to ?

I don &apos;t know what it is . something &apos;s happened to everybody .
please let me come in , and keep me here until I get over it .

I don &apos;t take in strangers unless they &apos;re sent here by somebody I know .
well , I know everybody you know . your brother-in-law , Uncle Billy .
-you know him ?
-Well , sure I do .
-When did you see him last ?
-Today over at his house .
it &apos;s a lie .
he &apos;s been in the insane asylum ever since he lost his business .
and if you ask me , that &apos;s where you belong .
strange , isn &apos;t it ?
each man &apos;s life touches so many other lives .
and when he isn &apos;t around , he leaves an awful hole , doesn &apos;t he ?
I &apos;ve heard of things like this .
you got me in some kind of a spell or something .
well , I &apos;m gonna get out of it . I &apos;ll get out of it .
I know how , too . I ...
the last man I talked to , before all this stuff started happening to me , was Martini .
you know where he lives ?
well , sure , I know where he lives . he lives in Bailey Park .
-Are you sure this is Bailey Park ?
-No , I &apos;m not sure of anything anymore .
all I know is this should be Bailey Park .
-But where are the houses ?
-you weren &apos;t here to build them .
your brother Harry Bailey broke through the ice and was drowned at the age of nine .
that &apos;s a lie . Harry Bailey went to war .
he got the Congressional Medal of Honor .
he saved the lives of every man on that transport .
every man on that transport died .
Harry wasn &apos;t there to save them , because you weren &apos;t there to save Harry .
you see , George ?
you really had a wonderful life .
don &apos;t you see what a mistake it would be to throw it away ?
-Clarence .
-Yes , George ?
-Where &apos;s Mary ?
-Oh , well , I can &apos;t ... I don &apos;t know how you know these things , but tell me , where is she ?
if you know where she is , tell me where my wife is .
-l &apos;m not supposed to tell .
-Please , Clarence , tell me where she is .
-you &apos;re not gonna like it , George .
-Where is she ?
she &apos;s an old maid . she never married .
where is Mary ? where is she ?
where is she ?
she &apos;s just about to close up the library !
there must be some easier way for me to get my wings .
Mary !
Mary ! Mary !
Mary , it &apos;s George . don &apos;t you know me ?
what &apos;s happened to us ?
I don &apos;t know you . let me go !
Mary , please ! Oh , don &apos;t do this to me . please , Mary , help me .
where &apos;s our kids ?
I need you , Mary .
help me , Mary !
Mary !
let me go !
help !
it &apos;s a wild man !
the wild man is chasing me . somebody stop him !
Tom !
Ed !
Charlie !
that &apos;s my wife !
-Mary !
-No , you don &apos;t .
somebody call the police .
somebody hit him on the head with a bottle .
you need a straightjacket .
Clarence !
get out of here !
Clarence !
-Clarence !
-Right , that &apos;s you !
stand back !
Clarence !
Clarence ! Clarence !
help me , Clarence !
get me back !

I don &apos;t care what happens to me .
get me back to my wife and kids .
help me , Clarence , please .
please . I want to live again . I want to live again .
I want to live again . please , God , let me live again .
Hey , George !
George !
you all right .
Hey , what &apos;s the matter ?
now get out of here , Bert , or I &apos;ll hit you again !
get out of here !
what the sam hill are you yelling for , George ?
you ...
George ?
Bert , do you know me ?
know you ? you kidding ?
I &apos;ve been looking all over town trying to find you .
I saw your car piled into that tree down there , and I thought maybe you ...
Hey , your mouth &apos;s bleeding . are you sure you &apos;re all right ?
what did ...
my mouth &apos;s bleeding , Bert !
my mouth &apos;s ...
Zuzu &apos;s petals . Zuzu ...

-What is this ...

- He thinks it &apos;s all right . - Oh , he &apos;s a thinker .
what &apos;s the bright boy &apos;s name down the counter ?
I forget .
- Hey . - Yeah ?

- What ? - You heard me .
- What &apos;s the idea ? - There isn &apos;t any idea .

- Only the cook . - Tell him to come in .
- Say , where do you ... ?
- Tell the cook to come out here .

Hey , Al , bright boy wants to know what it &apos;s all about .

I wouldn &apos;t say .
Hey , Al , bright boy says he wouldn &apos;t say what he thinks it &apos;s all about .
Hey , you . come here .

you mean Pete Lund ?
if that &apos;s what he calls himself .
- Comes in every night at six , don &apos;t he ? - Yes , if he comes .
we know all about that .
what are you going to kill him for ?
what did Pete Lund ever do to you ?
he never had a chance to do anything to us .
- He never even seen us . - He &apos;s only going to see us once .
what are you going to kill him for ?
- We &apos;re killing him for a friend . - Shut up .
you talk too much .
I got to keep bright boy amused , don &apos;t I ?
what are you going to do with us afterwards ?
that &apos;ll depend .
that &apos;s one of those things you never know at the time .
- Hello , George . - Hello , Fred .

Lund won &apos;t be in tonight .
- What makes you think so ? - It &apos;s after six .
if he comes , it &apos;s always before six .

sorry , but we &apos;re not serving .
- Why not ? - The cook &apos;s away . he &apos;s sick .
then why don &apos;t you get another cook ?
are you running a lunch counter or aren &apos;t you ?
you , bright boy .
that on the level about the Swede not showin &apos; up tonight ?
- Yeah .
- You wouldn &apos;t fool us , would you ?
when he &apos;s not here by six , he &apos;s not coming .
no , he ain &apos;t fooling .
he &apos;d know better than to fool .
- Come on , Al . - What about those two back there ?
bright boy , here .
- They &apos;re all right . - Think so ?
sure .
you got a lot of luck , bright boy .
that &apos;s the truth .
you ought to play the races .
Oh , dear .
I &apos;m glad we &apos;re all alive .
this never happened in this town before .
- I don &apos;t like it . don &apos;t like any part of it . - It &apos;s all right , Sam .
they were going to kill Pete Lund .
they were going to shoot him when he came in to dinner .
- The Swede ? - Yes .
I don &apos;t get it .
why would anyone want to kill the Swede ?
they &apos;ve gone over to the station . they &apos;ll probably get his address from the daybook .
Nick .
- You work with him . you better tell him . - I &apos;m going for the cops .
you better go tell the Swede first .
Swede !
I was over at Henry &apos;s . a couple of guys came in and tied up me and the cook .
they shoved us in the kitchen .
they said they were going to shoot you when you came in to supper .
George thought I ought to come over and tell you .
- There &apos;s nothing I can do about it . - I can tell you what they look like .
I don &apos;t want to know what they &apos;re like .
thanks for coming .
- Don &apos;t you want me to go and see the police ? - No .
- That wouldn &apos;t do any good . - Isn &apos;t there something I could do ?
- There ain &apos;t anything to do . - Couldn &apos;t you get out of town ?
no .
I &apos;m through with all that running &apos; around .
why do they want to kill you ?
I did something wrong once .
thanks for coming .
Yeah . that &apos;s all right .
Brentwood Police Station .
the chief is busy now . he &apos;ll call you back .
the way I look at it , this killing doesn &apos;t rightly concern Brentwood at all .
what concerns us is protecting the lives and property of our citizens .
this man Lund lived here , that &apos;s all .
the killers came from out of town , and they were here looking for Lund .
they ain &apos;t gunning for anyone else in town .
they made their getaway , and what happens to &apos; em from here on in is up to the state police .
- It &apos;s out of our hands . - This is what I &apos;m looking for .
&quot; beneficiary :
Mary Ellen Daugherty .
palms Hotel , Atlantic City . &quot; relative ?
haven &apos;t checked yet .
souvenir , I guess .
Yeah . could be .
- What do you know about Lund ? - Not much .
came here about a year ago .
lived at a boardinghouse out on Spruce Street . Mrs. Hirsch &apos;s .
never made any friends , as far as I can make out . kept pretty much to himself .
ma Hirsch says she can &apos;t ever remember him getting any mail even .
well ?
- They weren &apos;t any of these guys . - That &apos;s for certain .
these two boys saw the killers . they came into Henry &apos;s Diner looking for Lund .
said right out they were gonna kill him when he came in .
just happened Nick Adams was in the place that night .
he and Lund worked together at the filling station .
I ought to be getting back on the job. if you &apos;re done with me for now , I &apos;d better go .
- You can go . - Say , Adams .
what kind of a fellow was the Swede ?
it &apos;s okay , Nick .
Mr. Reardon &apos;s from the insurance company .
Ah , he wasn &apos;t a bad sort of fellow .
- You got along with him all right ? - Sure .
easy enough to get along with .
Uh-huh . think I &apos;ll have a look at the body .
right .
Nick , you take Mr. Reardon down to Pluthner and introduce him .
Mr. Pluthner &apos;s in charge of our county morgue .
- Thanks .
I &apos;d like to chat with Nick anyway . - Anything else I can do , let me know .
I &apos;d like a copy of the report on Lund &apos;s fingerprints soon as you get it .
- I &apos;ll send it right on to you .
- Fine . mind if I keep this ?
- Keep it . sure . - Thanks again .
tell me , Nick , the last time you and the Swede were together ...
Hello , Nick . what &apos;s on your mind ?
Mr. Pluthner , this is Mr. Reardon .
the chief asked me to bring him down .
I &apos;m with the Atlantic Casualty Company .
Tri-States Oil carries a group policy with us on its employees .
- Lund worked for them . - Well , the policy is now payable .
got eight slugs in him . near tore him in half .
- &quot; Once I did something wrong . &quot; - Huh ?
those were his last words to Nick here .
I wonder what he meant . &quot; once I did something wrong . &quot;
I don &apos;t know , but it was something a long time ago .
- How do you know that ? - Just the way he said it .
like it was something happened a long time back .
- Did the Swede eat at the diner every night ? - Yeah .
I wonder why he didn &apos;t show the night the killers were there .
he &apos;d been staying home for a few days . he didn &apos;t feel so good .
- What was the matter with him ? - I don &apos;t know .
stomach or something .
it started Thursday , a week ago .
I was at the filling station .
about an hour before closing , a guy drives in in a big black car .
Caddy , I think it was .
- Fill &apos; er up . Ethyl . - Yes , sir .
Hey , you !
look at the oil , will ya ?
it &apos;s okay .
check the rear tires .
wipe the windshield .
this town got a name ?
- Yeah . - What is it ?
- Brentwood . - Brentwood ?
- 3.83 with the tax . - Here , kid .
thanks .
thank you .
Brentwood , huh ?
Nick , you close up . I &apos;m going home .
what &apos;s the matter , Swede ? are you sick ?
Yeah .
I feel kind of sick .
and he walked off rubbing his stomach , and he didn &apos;t come to work next day .
only time I knew him to miss a day .
you didn &apos;t notice the license plates on the car , did you ?
it was an out-of-state car , though .
Illinois , I think , or maybe Pennsylvania .
and the man in the car , what did he look like ?
well , he was kind of heavyset . had a moustache .
look , mister , if you don &apos;t mind , I &apos;m feelin &apos; kind of sick myself .
Yeah .
I want to call Newark , honey .
market 3-2-600 .
uh , Brentwood 2-7-7 .
this is Reardon .
let me have my office , please .
Hello , Stella ? I &apos;m still up in Brentwood .
Yeah .
I &apos;ve had some postmortem photographs made of this fellow Lund .
I &apos;m sending you in a print . he &apos;s got broken knuckles , a fighter &apos;s hands .
have one of the boys take the picture over to Kelly &apos;s gym .
see if anyone there can identify him . get me anything you can on the guy .
what ? Oh , that can wait till I come in tomorrow .
well , tell the boys I &apos;ve taken a run down to Atlantic City .
I want to interview Lund &apos;s beneficiary .
around here , Mr. Reardon , they all call Mary Ellen &quot; Queenie . &quot;
she should be here any minute .
she &apos;s usually home from church by now .
there she is .
Queenie , will you come here a minute ?
this is Mr. Reardon .
Hello , Queenie .
thank you , Mrs. Grimes .
- Sit down , Queenie . - Thank you , sir .
I have news for you .
it may be good , it may be bad , according to your feeling for the deceased .
- Oh , did somebody die , sir ?
- Pete Lund .
- Who , sir ? - Pete Lund .
Oh , I know no one of that name .
well , you must have known him , Queenie .
you &apos;re his beneficiary .
his what , sir ?
his life was insured for $ 2,500 . it &apos;s payable to you .
Oh .
Oh , there must be some mistake .
nobody would be leaving me that much money .
there aren &apos;t any other Mary Ellen Daughertys employed here , are there ?
no , sir .
Oh . him it is !
- Who ? - Oh , the man in 1212 .
but ... but his name was never Lund .
it was , um , uh , Nelson .
that &apos;s who that is .
that &apos;s Mr. Nelson .
and you only knew him as a guest in the hotel ?
Yes , sir .
Oh , but that was years ago .
the year of the hurricane . 1940 , that was .
I remember because it was when my sister &apos;s youngest was born .
was it a natural death he was dying , Mr. Reardon ?
no , Queenie .
he was murdered .
murder , you say ?
how long did Mr. Nelson , as you call him , stay here ?
well , I couldn &apos;t say exactly , sir , but no longer than a few days .
- And you never saw him before or after ? - Never , sir .
why do you suppose he made his insurance payable to you ?
for the life of me , sir ...
murder , it was ?
tsk , tsk , tsk . poor Mr. Nelson .
well , there &apos;s one thing to be thankful for .
he can sleep in consecrated ground .
- What do you mean by that ? - The sin was not on his own soul .
why did you think he &apos;d killed himself ?
well , sir , now maybe I shouldn &apos;t be tellin &apos; it .
no , go ahead , Queenie .
well , sir , I was makin &apos; my rounds .
I was on night duty then , turning &apos; down the beds , and I came into 1212 .
Oh ! it was a sight to behold !
she &apos;s gone .
- She &apos;s gone ! - Who &apos;s gone , mister ?
don &apos;t do it , mister ! mister , don &apos;t ! please , mister .
Oh , if you did , you &apos;d never see the face of God .
you &apos;d burn in hell to the end of time . Oh , you mustn &apos;t , mister .
Oh , blessed Mother of God , help me . Oh , please .
she &apos;s gone !
Charleston was right .
he was right .
Charleston was right .
Atlantic Casualty , claim department .
there &apos;s your party .
go ahead .
- Good morning , Stella . - Good morning , dream boy .
- Mr. Kenyon wants to see you . - What about the Swede ?
Pete Lund .
- Oh , my notes aren &apos;t transcribed yet . - Uh-huh .
- You sent for me ? - What are you working on ?
- The Lund case . - That one of those $ 2,500 death benefits ?
- That &apos;s right . - Forget it .
- There &apos;s a damaged freight claim ... - Ever hear of anyone called Charleston ?
Charleston .
there was a petty-larceny thief . why ?
does a green handkerchief decorated with golden harps mean anything to you ?
what are you talking about , a green handkerchief ?
did you ever try to remember something like somebody &apos;s name , have it on the tip of your tongue almost , then , just as ...
- ... you &apos;re about to say it , lose it ? - I guess so .
well , that &apos;s how it is with me and this green handkerchief .
- It &apos;s real silk . whose was it ? - The dead man &apos;s .
listen . I &apos;m trying to run an organisation .
the number of claims piled up here ...
I could use six other investigators and still be behind .
and you &apos;re off fooling around with a two-for-a-nickel shooting .
but this isn &apos;t a two-for-a-nickel shooting .
two professional killers show up in a small town ... and put the blast on a filling station attendant , a nobody .
there was no attempt at robbery . they were out for only one thing .
to kill him .
why ?
I don &apos;t know .
and what &apos;s more , I don &apos;t care .
here , get to work on these .
give me a couple of more days . maybe a bell will ring .
I &apos;d fire you if I didn &apos;t know you &apos;d go right over to more money at the Prudential .
go ahead .
one more day .
never mind typing it up . you can do that later .
read it to me , huh ?
Kelly &apos;s gym was a good hunch .
&quot; real name :
Ole Andreson . born :
Philadelphia , June 23 , 1908 .
&quot; mother died 1909 . father employed by Philadelphia Transit Company .
&quot; died : 1916 .
started fighting professionally in 1928 .
&quot; weight : 173 .
last fight : Philadelphia Sports Arena , October 1935 . &quot;
I knew those hands were no accident .
&quot; three years later , October 1938 , arrested in Philadelphia for robbery .
&quot; sentenced to three years of hard labour by Justice Reagen .
released for good behaviour in May of &apos; 40 . &quot; that &apos;s all I could get .
that &apos;s enough .
look , call up Reynolds on the ledger .
give him the story .
he &apos;s done good turns for us .
and try and see if you can locate an old-time thief named Charleston , will you ?
Oh , by the way , who made that pinch on Andreson ?
detective Lieutenant Lubinsky . Philadelphia , fifth precinct .
Uh-huh . see you later .
- Sam ! - Yes ?
- Someone to see you . - Out here .
- Lieutenant Lubinsky ? - That &apos;s right .
what can I do for you ?
sit down , Mr. Reardon .
it &apos;s all right . they &apos;re dry .
I don &apos;t know whether you remember , but you once arrested a man named Ole Andreson .
- I remember . - Well , he &apos;s been murdered .
- Insured with your company ? - Yes .
okay , what do you want to know ?
anything you can tell me .
I can tell you almost everything about Ole up until the last few years .
both of us did .
his old man and mine worked together .
his was a motorman , mine a conductor .
Ole and I ran around together when we were kids .
I joined the department .
he started fightin &apos; .
we always kept in touch .
and you put the pinch on him ?
when you &apos;re a copper , you &apos;re a copper .
seems like I was always in there when he was losing .
did you ever see him fight ?
I don &apos;t think so . not that I remember .
he was pretty good .
take an awful lot of punishment .
Yeah .
I saw his first fight and I saw his last , though I didn &apos;t get there till the start of the last round .
he was fightin &apos; Tiger Lewis .
Hiya , Lieutenant .
all right , seconds out . come on , fella , let &apos;s clear the ring .
outside .
now use your right , Swede . he &apos;s wide open , and it &apos;s the last round .
keep throwing &apos; your right .
Hello , Pete .
has he got a chance ?
he &apos;s gettin &apos; murdered . can &apos;t last .
your right , Swede . let go with your right .
break it up , boys . step back .
one , two , three ,
- four , five , six , - Take nine , Swede .
take nine .
seven , eight , nine ...
what &apos;s the matter with you , Swede ? use your right ! your right !
one , two , three , four , five , six , seven ...
the winner !
Hey , Swede .
Swede ? do you know who I am ?
- Uhh . - Who am I ?
- You &apos;re ... you &apos;re ...
- Say who I am .
who am I ? say my name .
take a look at that hand .
gee .
no wonder he didn &apos;t throw his right .
Hey , Doc .
in there , please .
take a look at this .
have him come into my office in the morning for an X-ray .
- No wonder . - What round &apos;s comin &apos; up ?
the fight &apos;s over , Swede .
Yeah .
you &apos;d better get him under the shower .
- He &apos;s fought his last fight . - Yeah . just my luck .
well , he wasn &apos;t no Mickey Walker or Rosenbloom , but he &apos;d done all right .
I figure I &apos;m out about ten G &apos;s .
that ain &apos;t hay for me these days .
how you doing , Ole ?
- What happened ? - You were on the deck when the bell rang .
Yeah ?
see that he gets hot and cold compresses ... on that hand tonight to take the swelling down .
swelling down , swelling up . it don &apos;t make no difference now .
Ah , cheer up , Packy .
there &apos;s more where he came from .
ten G &apos;s is ten G &apos;s .
how &apos;d ya like that Irish kid that was fourth on the card ? that Callahan .
he &apos;s a powerhouse , that boy . wagner &apos;s got him .
I bet you could buy Callahan off Wagner for two , three hundred .
anyway , it won &apos;t go down in the record books as a K.O. , will it ?
that &apos;s right , Ole .
there &apos;s no use hanging around here . I never did like wakes .
good night .
- Good night . - Yeah , good night , fellas .
I bet you that Callahan would get your ten G &apos;s back for you .
that guy was a cinch .
I could have taken him easy if my right had been workin &apos; .
well , next time .
there isn &apos;t gonna be a next time .
what do you mean , no next time ?
you might as well know it right now .
- You &apos;re through . - Huh ?
that hand will never be good again . not for fighting .
- Who said so ? - The doc , for one .
maybe he &apos;s wrong .
he &apos;s not wrong , Ole .
the bones are all broken .
well , they can mend , can &apos;t they ?
not so &apos;s you can hit a toy balloon without breakin &apos; &apos; em all over again .
no . you &apos;re done fighting &apos; , Ole .
and if you want my opinion , it &apos;s a lucky thing . you aren &apos;t punchy yet .
suppose it was your brains were scrambled instead of your hand .
I ain &apos;t quitting &apos; .
it &apos;s not quittin &apos; if your hand &apos;s gone .
- I stayed the limit , didn &apos;t I ? - That &apos;s right .
they can &apos;t take that away from you .
- Want to eat ? - Yeah .
last time there were 50 guys outside ... just waitin &apos; to shake this .
funny when you lose a fight , ain &apos;t it ?
- Hello , Lilly . - Oh .
Hi . Hello , Swede . you all right ?
Yeah .
I guess you don &apos;t feel like much celebration tonight .
maybe you &apos;d like to come over to my house . I &apos;ll cook up something to eat .
well , Lilly , I &apos;ll tell you .
right now , I &apos;m ... I &apos;m not hungry .
- You invited the wrong guy . - Ah , you .
you were born hungry .
did you see the fight ?
I was in my regular seat .
I didn &apos;t notice tonight .
Hey , what was the matter with your right ?
he hurt it .
too bad , Ole . you &apos;d have taken him sure .
Yeah .
- Well , Lilly , I ...
- I know , Ole .
guess I better be going on home .
- Yeah , I &apos;ll call you up tomorrow . - Okay .
- Good night , Sam . - I &apos;ll be seeing you , Lilly .
what am I going to do if I quit fighting &apos; ?
well , there &apos;s always the department .
no , I wouldn &apos;t want to be a copper .
it &apos;s not a bad life , Ole . Twenty years and you &apos;ve got a pension .
and it &apos;s $ 2,200 a year to start .
$ 2,200 a year .
you know something ?
some months I made that much in one month .
some months .
after that I didn &apos;t see much of Ole .
it wasn &apos;t my fault . just one of those things .
- Sam ! - Yes ?
open the door .
Whew ! it &apos;s getting muggy .
thought you might like some lemonade .
swell . this is Mr. Reardon .
- My wife . - How are you ?
- We were just talking about Ole . - Poor boy .
- You knew him , Mr. Reardon ? - No .
Mr. Reardon is investigating his death .
he was a good boy . no one had any call to kill him .
Lilly knew Ole too . the three of us were together a good part of the time .
- She was always in love with him . - Sam !
and I was always in love with her .
worked out fine for me anyway .
I haven &apos;t been too unhappy myself .
how recently had you seen the Swede , Mrs. Lubinsky ?
- Oh , not since Sam and I got married . - Just about nine years ago .
September the 26th .
Ole was best man .
it was about six months before that that Ole and I , well , uh , stopped seeing each other .
- Just about . - Why was that ?
don &apos;t mean to be out of line , but we have so little to work on .
anything may help .
Oh , I don &apos;t mind telling you , though it &apos;s not very flattering .
Ole and I had a date to go to the movies .
at least , I thought that &apos;s where we were going ... until we went into this hotel .
who &apos;s giving this party ?
- Jake gave us the invite .
- Jake who ?
Jake , the fella I introduced you to in the restaurant the other night .
- Oh . I don &apos;t like him . - Why ?
he &apos;s got mean eyes .
him and me may be going into business .
look , honey , you go on ahead . I got a headache .
since when ? Aw , come on . you &apos;ll have a good time .
Hello .
come in , folks .
come in .
- Swede , good to see you . - How &apos;s it , Jake ?
fine , fine .
and it &apos;s good to see the little lady too .
- What was your name again , honey ? - Miss Harmon .
Miss Harmon . swell .
- Blinky , you know the Swede . - Oh .
- Miss Harmon , Blinky Franklin .
- How do you do ?
at the piano , Lou Tingle , and our hostess , Miss Collins .
Kitty , Mr. Andreson and Miss Harmon .
Hello .
- What are you drinking , Miss Harmon ? - Ginger ale , please . plain .
- Swede ? - Rye and water .
- Ah , Blinky . - Yeah ?
rye and water and ginger ale plain .
make yourself at home , folks .
- Jake tells me you &apos;re a fighter . - Do you like the fights ?
I &apos;m afraid I &apos;ve never seen one .
- No kiddin &apos; ! - I hate brutality , Mr. Andreson .
the idea of two men beating each other to a pulp makes me ill .
I saw all Swede &apos;s fights .
how wonderful of you .
I could never bear to see a man I really care for being hurt .
Kitty .
Oh , excuse me .
- She &apos;s beautiful . - Yes .
plain ginger ale for you , lady .
I &apos;ve changed my mind . you can sweeten it now .
no trouble whatsoever .
it &apos;s a nice apartment .
must cost a fortune to keep it up .
I &apos;ll bet they need two servants at least to take care of it .
the more I know of love
the less I know it
here &apos;s your drink , lady .
- The more I give to love - I said , here &apos;s your drink , lady .
- The more I owe it - Oh , thank you very much .
- Sit down . - Me ?
- Nice apartment . - Big Jim likes to live well .
- Big Jim ? - Yeah . Colfax .
- He &apos;s not here tonight ? - Tonight ? no , ma &apos;am .
nor last night nor tomorrow night . not for a lot of nights .
big Jim has his time all booked up .
Jim &apos;s out of town , Miss Harmon .
a heartbreak or two
the more I know of love
and you
right then I knew the boat had sailed .
I just got my things and went on home .
I don &apos;t think Ole even missed me .
he &apos;d never been in love before .
- When he fell , it had to be for dynamite .
Colfax ? a thief with a touch of class .
was in jail at the time .
went straight after he came out .
that was seven , eight years ago .
- And the Swede went crooked ? - I know what you &apos;re thinking , Mr. Reardon .
I seem like a good deal of a heel , don &apos;t I ?
first , I marry Ole &apos;s girl . then I send him up for three years .
Oh , now don &apos;t talk nonsense , Sam . I wasn &apos;t Ole &apos;s girl , not when I married you .
and you didn &apos;t set out to arrest him .
that &apos;s right .
Lil and I had been married about a month then .
and one night , I went into Lou Tingle &apos;s cafe .
I &apos;d been given a tip on some hot jewellery .
- Hello , Sam . - Hiya , Charlie .
Miss Bryson , Lieutenant Lubinsky .
- How &apos;re tricks , Sam ? - It &apos;s been a long time .
- You &apos;re partly to blame for that . - Only 90 days &apos; worth .
no hard feelings .
who &apos;s the girl sittin &apos; next to Jake the Rake ?
name of Collins .
- She got any other names ? - None that I know of .
she couldn &apos;t be Kitty Collins , could she ?
waiter !
Yes , sir ?
- More coffee . - Yes , sir .
she &apos;s Big Jim Colfax &apos;s girl , isn &apos;t she ?
Ole Andreson &apos;s girl now , or so I hear .
good night , Ginny .
don &apos;t you know what happens to little boys who play with matches ?
just a minute .
- Pretty , isn &apos;t it ? - I never saw it before in my life .
I don &apos;t know anything about it .
- I swear , Lieutenant . - Get your street clothes on .
this belong to you ?
that ? me ? no .
- Maybe you know who the owner is ? - I haven &apos;t any idea .
not you , Jake ?
how about the rest of you ?
well , since it was Kitty here had it on , I guess she &apos;ll have to be the one I take in .
- Let &apos;s go , Kitty . - Hi , Swede .
Hello , Barbara .
Oh , thank you .
Hello , everybody .
Kitty , Jake . all set to go ?
I finally got some front row ...
Sam ! well , I &apos;ll be ! how are you , boy ?
okay , Ole . okay .
you seem to be doing all right .
that numbers racket really pays off .
boy , you know everything . this is one smart copper .
you know how long him and me knows each other ? since we were little kids .
how about a fast drink ?
what &apos;s the matter ?
Kitty , what is it ?
I &apos;m runnin &apos; her in , Swede .
- You mean a pinch ? - That &apos;s what I mean .
but you can &apos;t do this , Sam .
you &apos;re not going to try and stop me , are you , Ole ?
don &apos;t you worry , honey . nothing &apos;s gonna happen to you .
- Sam , let &apos;s you and me sit down and talk . - Some other time , Ole .
but be reasonable , Sam . you don &apos;t understand .
Kitty here and me are ...
I know . I know .
but I &apos;m only interested in this .
sorry your girl had to be wearin &apos; it , but that &apos;s how it goes .
- If your girl happens to be a shoplifter ... - It &apos;s not true , Swede .
I didn &apos;t take it . I had no idea it was stolen .
Swede , make him listen . I &apos;ll give it back . I &apos;ll do anything if he &apos;ll just let me go .
please , don &apos;t let him take me in , Swede , or they &apos;ll throw the book at me .
Sam .
I &apos;m asking you for old time &apos;s sake .
- There &apos;s nothing I can do , Ole . come on . - Wait a minute .
you don &apos;t want her , Sam .
I swiped that stuff myself .
I was lettin &apos; her wear it just for tonight .
I &apos;m the one you &apos;re after .
get me ?
try and get me .
of course , we did get him the next day .
he was trying to catch a bus to New York .
I pleaded with him to tell the truth , but he stuck to his story .
it got him three years .
I went down to the train when they took him away , and that was the last I ever saw of him .
you &apos;d have never known that right of his was broken , the way it felt .
- What became of Kitty ? - Oh , she went her own sweet way .
haven &apos;t heard of her in years .
- Oh , Lilly . - Yes , dear .
you better get ready .
we &apos;re burying Ole this afternoon , Mr. Reardon .
us and Packy Robinson .
when I read in the papers about him being dead , I sent to Brentwood for his body .
I figured we owed him a decent send-off .
all that the Father giveth me shall come to me , and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out .
he that raised up Jesus from the dead will also quicken ... our mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in us .
Reardon , if you ever find out who killed Ole , let me in on it .
who &apos;s the man with the derby ?
Packy was his manager .
- And the guy with him ?
- Joe Smalley , his trainer .
at thy right hand , there is pleasure forever more .
who &apos;s the other fellow over there ?
Oh , an old-time hoodlum named Charleston .
and we commit his body to the ground .
earth to earth , ashes to ashes , dust to dust .
Charleston don &apos;t talk , see .
even if he &apos;s worked over head to foot by experts .
- Charleston never talks . - Good enough .
you know what happened to the Swede ?
I know plenty , mister .
plenty . only I ain &apos;t telling &apos; .
old Charleston &apos;s the little monkey with his hands over his mouth .
how well did you know the Swede ?
me ?
mister ,
I guess me and the Swede were about as close as two guys can get .
for nearly two years , we weren &apos;t never more than eight and a half feet apart .
that &apos;s how big the cell was .
- There &apos;s Jupiter . - Mmm .
Jupiter &apos;s a planet .
do you know how many planets there are circling &apos; the sun ?
- How many ? - Nine .
Jupiter &apos;s to the earth like a ... like a football is to a marble .
that big .
then on the other hand , Mars ain &apos;t no bigger than a bean .
that small .
how come you know so much about the stars ?
Oh , I don &apos;t know .
Exceptin &apos; after lights out , nights I couldn &apos;t sleep ...
I used to look at &apos; em through the bars .
I knew they had names , and pretty soon I got to wondering &apos; which was which .
so I got me a book from the prison library ... and began to study up on &apos; em .
I don &apos;t guess there &apos;s a better place in the whole world ... for learning about stars than stir .
- That up there &apos;s the constellation of Orion . - Where ?
there .
otherwise known as the &quot; Big Bear . &quot;
you see that bright star in the centre ?
that &apos;s Betelgeuse , the &quot; Red Giant . &quot;
the brightest star in all the heavens .
only it &apos;s so far away it don &apos;t seem like it .
Charleston .
Yeah ?
- You know what harps mean ? - Angels play &apos; em .
they mean Ireland .
that &apos;s why they call them Micks &apos; Harps .
Kitty &apos;s Irish .
she gave me this .
- A couple of more weeks , you &apos;ll be out . - Yeah .
- I want you to do something for me . - You name it .
it &apos;s been a long time since I heard from Kitty .
Yeah , I know .
- Look her up . see if she &apos;s okay , will you ? - Sure thing .
maybe she &apos;s sick or somethin &apos; .
I &apos;m worried .
Swede , I studied up on girls times I wasn &apos;t in stir .
and you know what ?
a girl don &apos;t write , that don &apos;t mean she &apos;s sick like you might think .
not necessarily .
Yes , sir ,
I guess you &apos;d say I knew the Swede real well .
did you find out about his girl ?
no , sir , I didn &apos;t .
I didn &apos;t find out a thing . and do you know why ?
because she didn &apos;t live there anymore .
but you saw the Swede again ?
sure , after he got out .
when was the last time you saw him ?
- Mister , did you say when ? - Yes .
mister , when it comes to dates , 1492 is the only one I can remember .
I can tell you what was the last time , but not where nor when or who was present .
all right . what was the last time ?
that &apos;s better . much better .
word was passed along to me ... that a certain party wanted to see me .
I was to be at a certain place ... at a certain time and bring the Swede .
he &apos;d just got out a couple days before .
sit down !
never knew a guy who was in stir more than ten years ... didn &apos;t walk up and down all the time .
Oh , it ain &apos;t that .
it &apos;s just I get nervous sitting &apos; still .
well , we get nervous , you walking up and down all the time .
- What are we waitin &apos; for anyway ? - Want to play some blackjack ?
not with you I don &apos;t .
I know your reputation .
- What about my reputation ? - Nothin &apos; about it .
I just don &apos;t want to play blackjack with you , that &apos;s all .
cut for deal .
anyhow , I didn &apos;t come up here to play cards .
you were going to tell us about a caper .
go ahead .
- We &apos;re waiting for the Swede to show . - Well , I &apos;m tired of waiting .
you can leave anytime you want , friend .
come on , easy does it , fellas . easy does it .
I don &apos;t like to be asked to come up here and then told I can go .
who do you think you &apos;re pushin &apos; around ?
a minute ago we were talking about reputations .
well , you &apos;ve got quite a reputation yourself .
you &apos;re supposed to be a troublemaker .
okay , make some .
- Who &apos;s there ? - It &apos;s me . Andreson .
- Hello , Swede . - Good evening .
- Glad to see you , Swede . - Hello .
- How are you , Charleston ? - Hello , Swede .
Hello .
I take it you know everybody .
- Yeah . - Grab yourself a chair .
now that the Swede &apos;s here , maybe we can get started .
- Yeah , what &apos;s the pitch ? - It &apos;s big .
the biggest caper that &apos;s been pulled around here in years .
it should be good for better than 250 grand .
- Bank job ? - Uh-uh .
payroll .
- Where ? - After you decide whether you &apos;re in or not .
how am I to decide if I don &apos;t know what the layout is ?
that &apos;s your problem , but I &apos;ll tell you this .
the job &apos;s been cased backwards and forwards .
the getaway &apos;s been fixed and we &apos;ve got ten days to plan every last move .
- Would just us be in on it ? - Uh-huh .
what &apos;ll the split be ?
I take the first hundred grand . the rest you divide to suit yourselves .
who declared you in for the big slice ?
I declared myself .
if you don &apos;t like the setup , declare yourself out .
and no hard feelings .
what about her ?
she &apos;s with me .
- It &apos;s a four-way split then without you . - What about it ?
I &apos;m in , provided the rest of us share and share alike .
- No more long splits . - Okay by me .
you ?
you twitch a lot , friend . nervous , huh ?
carrying the monkey on your back , ain &apos;t you ?
- I was . I &apos;m not anymore . - Is that straight ?
he wouldn &apos;t be here if it wasn &apos;t .
okay , I &apos;m in .
Charleston ?
- Count me out . - What &apos;s the matter ?
Oh , I don &apos;t know ...
- Something you don &apos;t like ? - Maybe it &apos;s too big .
I don &apos;t get you .
if it &apos;s as big as you claim , it &apos;s not going to be any easy pickings .
nothing that big ever is .
and that &apos;s what I want from here on in . easy pickings .
it &apos;d go just as hard with you if you were taken for stickin &apos; up a shine parlor .
Yes , that &apos;s right , but the chances of being taken aren &apos;t as many .
I don &apos;t know . maybe ...
... maybe I &apos;m just gettin &apos; old .
it &apos;s like you were saying before the Swede come in .
I &apos;ve done a lot of time .
I &apos;ve spent almost half my life in stir , and I don &apos;t intend to spend any more .
okay , Charleston .
so long .
so long .
- No offence . - No offence .
what about you , Swede ?
I &apos;m in .
- Right . - So long , Swede .
be seeing you , Charleston .
- Do you want a word of advice ? - Huh ?
stop listening to those golden harps , Swede .
they can land you into a lot of trouble .
what are you drivin &apos; at ?
I left him , and I waited out in the hall .
I had hoped he &apos;d walk out too , but he never showed up .
and I never seen the Swede again .
I was sorry ... &apos; cause him and me ...
we had some good talks about the stars .
- Good morning , Stella . - Good morning , dream boy .
I got that dope on Charleston for you .
working in a Philadelphia pool hall . 1700 block on Chestnut .
- What am I doing here ? - Don &apos;t change the subject .
see if you can get anything on a girl named Kitty Collins .
- Well , the bell rang . - What bell ?
the green handkerchief .
I just came from the library .
take a look at this .
&quot; bandits rob hat factory of quarter-million payroll .
&quot; Prentiss Hat Company in Hackensack victim of daring holdup . &quot;
- What &apos;s the connection ? - Well , read it .
&quot; the Prentiss Hat Company in Hackensack , New Jersey ,
&quot; was the victim yesterday of a sensational robbery .
&quot; each step of the holdup had obviously been carefully planned ,
&quot; and police officials are certain the job was masterminded ...
&quot; by someone with first-hand knowledge of the hat company &apos;s operations .
&quot; shortly before eight o &apos;clock , four men ,
&quot; all wearing employee identification badges ,
&quot; joined the incoming day shift at the Prentiss factory .
&quot; there was nothing unusual about the interlopers ...
&quot; as they lined up with the other employees ,
&quot; and the gatekeeper had no reason for suspicion ...
&quot; as the four robbers sauntered through the gate ,
&quot; ostensibly on their way to work .
&quot; at the Prentiss factory , the paymaster &apos;s office ...
&quot; is just across the yard from the employees &apos; gate .
&quot; apparently , the strangers merely crossed the yard ,
&quot; loitered near the stairway that leads to the cashier &apos;s office ,
&quot; and then entered the building , taking their own sweet time in the move .
&quot; a few seconds later , while the paymaster and his assistants ...
&quot; were working on routine tasks in connection with company business ,
&quot; the holdup men suddenly appeared .
&quot; at the point of drawn guns ,
&quot; they performed the robbery with detailed precision .
&quot; two of the bandits proceeded to rifle ...
&quot; the company &apos;s safe and paymaster &apos;s till ...
&quot; while the others bound and gagged the Prentiss employees .
&quot; they then left hastily ,
&quot; using the same door through which they had previously entered .
&quot; they took with them the company &apos;s entire semi-monthly payroll ...
&quot; amounting to $ 254,912 .
&quot; entering the yard again , the bandits fell in behind a truck ...
&quot; that was just leaving the factory .
&quot; with the gates open to permit the truck to exit into the street ,
&quot; the holdup men dashed into the clear ...
&quot; and made their way to three cars that had been planted earlier for the escape .
&quot; the gatekeeper , Henry Wilson , of 411 Spring Street ,
&quot; ran into the street , firing a warning shot ...
&quot; and shouting for them to stop .
&quot; when they ignored his command , Wilson fired first at one car ,
&quot; and then at another that was having trouble in the getaway .
&quot; this latter car returned the fire as it sped past Wilson ,
&quot; and the gatekeeper fell to the ground with a bullet in his groin .
&quot; he is now in the Hackensack hospital ,
&quot; where doctors say he will probably recover .
&quot; the four bandits all had their faces covered during the actual robbery ,
&quot; so no detailed description is available .
&quot; one of them , however , is described by the paymaster as wearing ...
&quot; an unusual green handkerchief decorated with golden harps over his face .
state and local police are investigating . &quot;
&quot; unusual green handkerchief . &quot;
they sell those by the thousand every St. Patrick &apos;s Day .
but this is the one that was used in that holdup .
- How do you know that ? - Follow me .
take an ex-pug named the Swede , falls for a girl named Kitty Collins .
he takes a three-year rap for her .
when he gets out , he &apos;s brought into a robbery setup ... through an old-time thief named Charleston .
there &apos;s a girl present the night of the big pow-wow .
Charleston wouldn &apos;t name names , but my guess is that same Kitty Collins .
go on .
the Prentiss Hat robbery was July 20 , 1940 .
that same night , the Swede and an unidentified woman ... check into a small hotel in Atlantic City .
two days later the woman takes a powder , and the Swede tries to pile out a window .
a chambermaid saves his life , and he &apos;s grateful enough to leave her his insurance .
- Is that all ? - Just about .
until six years later , we find the Swede in Brentwood .
as far as anyone knows , a filling-station attendant .
except ... he &apos;s waiting for some killers to come and get him .
huh . nice of him to hang on to this , wasn &apos;t it ?
without it , I &apos;d have gone about my business and the whole thing would have blown over .
- Forget it . - What ?
- It &apos;s not worth your time . - But we insured Prentiss Hat .
there &apos;s a quarter million of Atlantic Casualty money that &apos;s never been recovered .
Reardon , you know the insurance business .
the losses in any one year determine the premium to be paid the following .
we pay out in 1940 , as we did with Prentiss Hat .
that &apos;s adjusted in our rates for 1941 .
this is 1946 .
our job is to keep our losses at a minimum ... so that the rates don &apos;t have to go up in 1947 .
- That &apos;s how we serve the public . - You &apos;re not interested in recovering it ?
Oh , sure I am , if you knew just where to lay your hands on it , but you don &apos;t .
you have a hunch about one man who may have been in the holdup .
he &apos;s dead . aside from that , you know nothing .
I didn &apos;t know that two days ago .
Kenyon speaking .
for you .
Reardon . Hello , Lubinsky .
how are you ?
what ? the devil you say .
hold the wire a minute .
am I still on this case or have I quit Atlantic Casualty ?
- Well , I ...
- Which is it ?
all right . I &apos;ll give you a week .
but if you don &apos;t turn up the dough , the time comes off your vacation .
okay , Lubinsky , I &apos;ll be with you in an hour .
two sailors found him lying in a depot washroom in a pool of blood .
the shooting &apos; couldn &apos;t have happened more than a minute or two earlier .
- Who is he ?
- Ever hear of Blinky Franklin ?
keeps ravin &apos; on and on about the Swede , Dum-Dum Clark ... and our old friend Kitty Collins .
no use my telling you , though . you can get it straight from the horse &apos;s mouth .
- What are his chances ? - Nil .
- How long has he got ? - He &apos;s behind schedule now .
if that guy don &apos;t call by 10 : 30 , we better get started anyway .
each one steal his own heap .
still raining. it would be .
bet ten . I &apos;ll stay .
I never was in a hat factory before .
- You ain &apos;t in this one yet . - The night before the Prentiss Hat robbery .
give me two cards .
I &apos;ll take three .
if this rain keeps up , it &apos;ll be mud up to the axles on them hick roads .
how many miles of dirt road is it to the Halfway House ?
I don &apos;t like anything about capers in the rain .
rain always gives me the creeps .
I hate rain .
I hate rain .
one for the dealer .
eleven miles to the Halfway House , Blinky , your &apos;s and Dum-Dum &apos;s route .
- I can &apos;t win a pot . - Me either .
how about it , boys ? got all the moves straight in your minds now ?
we ought to .
we &apos;ve been over it often enough .
- Why don &apos;t that guy call ? - Relax , Dum-Dum .
waitin &apos; on word about cars reminds me that ... a couple of birds I used to know once stuck up a theatre in L.A .
everything goes swell ...
until they go to get in their heap .
you know what ? somebody stolen it .
a traffic cop shoots one of the birds dead ... up an alley in back of the theatre .
the other bird surrenders with all the money .
some story . know any more like it ?
Yeah .
there &apos;s another bird I used to know ...
well , don &apos;t tell it ! we don &apos;t want to listen to your stories , see ?
go ahead , deal the cards .
I fell asleep .
- Let me cut before you deal , will ya ? - What &apos;s the matter with you ?
- What do you mean , what &apos;s the matter ? - You &apos;re nervous .
you &apos;re all in a sweat .
you keep your mouth shut if you don &apos;t want it slapped shut .
- You been askin &apos; for it lately . - Hey !
- Any objections ? - Yeah !
keep out of this , Swede .
she &apos;s his girl .
mind your own business , Swede . I can take care of myself .
you touch me and you won &apos;t live till morning .
come on , Swede , play a few hands .
move over .
- Deal &apos; em . - Deal me out .
- Three cards . - Same .
one for the dealer . $ 150 .
I fold .
up you $ 100 .
- Up you $ 200 . - Up you $ 200 .
- I &apos;ll look . - Two pair . aces and sevens .
tough . full house . Eights over deuces .
reach for that and I &apos;ll kick your brains out .
what did he hit him for ? I don &apos;t get it .
nobody can cheat me and get away with it .
didn &apos;t you think he had &apos; em ?
he oughta showed me his cards before reaching for the pot .
if it wasn &apos;t for tomorrow , I &apos;d be for giving you the works .
- He should &apos;ve turned his cards over . - Yeah .
the job comes first , but afterwards , we &apos;ll have business together .
anytime you say .
Hello . Yeah .
Yeah , this is him .
Uh-huh . what are they ?
Uh-huh . okay .
the cars are waiting at the garages . everything is okay .
- We may as well get goin &apos; then . - See you in the morning .
Yeah . you too , Swede .
he shouldn &apos;t have hit you .
you had &apos; em just like you said .
he shouldn &apos;t have hit you .
he shouldn &apos;t have hit you .
beats me . I don &apos;t know what keeps him going .
will he be able to talk anymore ?
he &apos;s dead now , except he &apos;s breathing .
well , guess I &apos;ll have to hunt up my old friend , Kitty Collins .
we &apos;ve got nothing on her . this isn &apos;t evidence .
don &apos;t I know it ?
swell chance of ever getting ... the ravings of a delirious man admitted as testimony .
here &apos;s something , Lieutenant .
Hmm . a newspaper story of the Swede &apos;s murder ...
- and a bus ticket to Brentwood . - They were in his pants pocket .
step on it .
can &apos;t you get any more out of it than this ?
looks like a good clean getaway .
it &apos;s too bad you had to shoot that guy at the gate .
the robbery &apos;s over . this is the getaway .
did it look like 200 G &apos;s to you ?
most money I ever saw all at once .
wonder if the others are playing on the same luck we are .
they should be . they got away before we did .
I guess the Swede made it all right .
I seen him runnin &apos; for his heap and nobody was between him and it .
sure , he got away .
keep your eyes peeled for Polk Road .
it &apos;s a left turn there . Yeah . a left on Polk Road .
we oughta be there in another five minutes .
Hello , farmer .
- Others here yet ? - I &apos;m in here .
Hey !
- Everything go okay ? - Yeah .
definitely .
Oh , boy .
and they aren &apos;t marked , either .
no use standing &apos; around lookin &apos; at it . let &apos;s start countin &apos; !
stand back , you .
all right , heist &apos; em !
turn around . you , drop that gun .
up against the wall . put your hands up .
higher !
swell idea you guys had .
leavin &apos; me holdin &apos; the bag at the Halfway House while you split up the dough , huh ?
I &apos;ll betcha it handed you a laugh .
the Halfway House burnt down last night . that &apos;s why we came here .
- Somebody oughta have let me know . - You were told . you &apos;re here .
next time , play it straight .
I &apos;ll be seein &apos; ya , Swede .
there goes a quarter of a million dollars ! a quarter of a million .
a quarter of a million .
it took him six years to find out where the Swede was hiding .
- And then it was too late . - Yeah .
I wonder what he and the Swede &apos;ll have to say to each other now .
at least we know why Blinky was on his way to Brentwood .
a quarter of a million makes pretty good bait .
I wonder which other one of the gang knocked him off to beat him to the punch .
Hmm . the Swede &apos;s room in Brentwood should answer that .
officer .
what is it ?
- Got any rooms ? - Just one .
- Can I see it ? - This way .
upstairs .
just got in town .
fella runs the lunchroom down the street said you had a roomer here .
name of Lund , somethin &apos; like that .
said he died .
thought the room might still be empty .
it still is empty . this is it .
it &apos;ll do .
- Nine dollars a week , in advance . - Okay .
the bathroom &apos;s down the hall , the last room on the right .
here &apos;s your money .
I &apos;ll let you know if I want anything .
all right .
is that the man ?
I &apos;ll go call the police .
find anything ? better put your hands up .
- What are you after ? - Same thing you are .
the money from the Prentiss Hat caper .
- Where do you come in ? - I know about it .
that &apos;s enough .
- How do you know about it ? - Blinky Franklin told me .
- Blinky &apos;s dead . - I know . sit over there .
- Is this a pinch ? - I &apos;m not a cop .
then what do you want from me ?
you don &apos;t know what the Swede did with the money ... or you wouldn &apos;t be here tearing his room to pieces .
but maybe you do know things that , put together with the things I know , will tell me where the money is .
and the way things stand , I think you &apos;d better answer my questions .
what do you wanna know ?
why did you meet at the farmer &apos;s after the robbery ... instead of the Halfway House as you &apos;d planned ?
well ?
that caper was a long time ago .
come on , Dum-Dum .
you remember .
Halfway House burned down the night before the caper .
Uh-huh . and who picked the farmer &apos;s ?
mister , you wanna know too much .
Dum-Dum ,
Blinky was killed with your special kind of a bullet out of a .45 .
- A gun just like this . - You makin &apos; a deal ?
I can &apos;t see you &apos;ve anything to lose either way .
who picked the farmer &apos;s ?
- Who do you think ? - I &apos;m asking , you &apos;re answering .
Colfax .
that wouldn &apos;t be Big Jim , would it ?
when did you get the news of the Halfway House burning down ?
we &apos;d all split up by then .
we weren &apos;t gonna meet until next mornin &apos; at the factory .
Colfax knew where we all were . he sent us word about the change .
who by ? Kitty ?
what time ?
she got to my hideout around midnight .
at the farmer &apos;s when the Swede stuck you guys up , he claimed he hadn &apos;t been told about the switch .
how else would he have known to come to the farmer &apos;s ?
did you kill the Swede ?
not me .
I never could find him .
I didn &apos;t know where he was at until I read in the papers about his getting &apos; it .
- Who did kill him ? - You got me .
it wasn &apos;t Blinky and me .
we were after the money .
would we knock off the one guy could tell us where it was ?
and you killed Blinky so he couldn &apos;t get here ahead of you .
Aw , I &apos;d have split with him .
I didn &apos;t want him to come here . he might &apos;ve got picked up .
those kind of guys &apos;ll blab anything if you work on &apos; em right .
uh , okay if I smoke ?
Yeah .
by the way , what &apos;s become of Kitty Collins ?
Kitty ?
let me see now .
last I heard of Kitty ...
okay , mister .
now it &apos;s your turn to answer the questions .
why &apos;d you wanna know about Kitty ?
come on ! now I &apos;m askin &apos; , you &apos;re answering .
I think she knows where the money is .
- How do you figure ?
- The Swede and some girl ... checked into an Atlantic City hotel the night of the holdup .
two days later , the girl took a powder .
I &apos;ve got an idea the dough went with her .
what makes you think it was Kitty ? she was Colfax &apos;s girl .
I &apos;m not arguing with you .
Yeah , yeah . I got it .
you &apos;re makin &apos; a sucker play , Dum-Dum .
the cops are outside waiting &apos; for you .
I &apos;ll take care of the cops .
so long , mister .
there &apos;s a man on the roof !
- Hello , Lieutenant . glad to see you . - Hello .
- What gives ? - I think we &apos;re on the home stretch .
- Where are we goin &apos; ? - Pittsburgh .
he doesn &apos;t know it yet , but I &apos;ve got a date with your old friend , Big Jim Colfax .
- Remember ? Kitty &apos;s ex-boyfriend ? - Yeah .
as the number-one man .
he planned the whole Prentiss Hat job .
- Where &apos;d you get that ? - Dum-Dum .
- He showed , did he , at Brentwood ? - Yeah .
- He also got away after a gun battle . - &apos; Board !
they found blood on the roof where he &apos;d been hit .
every cop in Brentwood is claiming credit for the shot .
- What were you doing at the time ? - I was in the Swede &apos;s room , sleeping it off .
big Jim , huh ? he was supposed to have gone legit .
- He has .
big contractor now . - Mr. Reardon ?
- Here I am . that &apos;s me .
- James Reardon ?
- Telegram , sir . - Thank you .
&quot; answering your query , Halfway House fire ...
&quot; July 20 , 1940 , at 2 : 53 a.m .
signed , Kenny , Chief , Hackensack Fire Department . &quot;
- What &apos;s it mean ? - Means we &apos;re headed in the right direction .
Oh , by the way , did you bring along that extra .45 ?
Yeah . what happened to yours ?
- Oh , it got lost or stolen or ...
- Or something .
Mmm . let &apos;s get some shut-eye .
- Mr. Colfax ? - Yeah .
not interested in insurance , Mr. Reardon .
I &apos;m not a salesman .
I &apos;m investigating the death of a man named Ole Andreson .
alias Pete Lund , but best known as the Swede .
I don &apos;t remember any of those names .
- Work for me ? - You could call it that .
- How long ago ? - 1940 .
Oh . hunting season starts pretty soon .
I never miss the first day .
I learned that Andreson was a member of a gang ... that once robbed the Prentiss Hat Factory of about a quarter of a million .
Oh , yeah .
I remember reading about that .
they all got away , didn &apos;t they ? the law never caught up with any of them .
not so far .
but most of them turned out to be unhealthy .
the farmer died from natural causes .
the Swede and Blinky Franklin were both killed .
Dum-Dum went back to Brentwood and got shot in a fight with the police .
do you know who else was in the gang ?
you were .
me ?
no , brother , you &apos;re on the wrong track .
I &apos;m an honest citizen .
- Seems to have paid off pretty well . - I &apos;ve got no complaints .
people around here ...
the businessmen and all ... they know I served time , but they don &apos;t hold it against me .
they figure if a guy &apos;s trying to level , he deserves a helping hand .
nice speech , Colfax .
solid .
look , Reardon , if you &apos;re trying to pin anything on me , go right ahead .
- I got nothing to hide . - That &apos;s your opinion .
anyhow , I haven &apos;t got one shred of evidence against you .
nothin &apos; but hearsay .
frankly , it &apos;s not you I &apos;m interested in .
I want to find out what &apos;s become of a girl named Kitty Collins .
- You remember Kitty ? - Yeah , I remember Kitty .
it was Kitty Collins and not the Swede that reaped the golden harvest .
- How do you mean ?
- When the gang met to divvy up , the Swede pulled a fast one and walked off with the whole take .
no wonder he got blasted .
that same night , he and Kitty were together in Atlantic City .
she walked out on him a couple of days later .
the money disappeared when she did .
is that on the level , Reardon ?
a chambermaid at the hotel can identify Kitty ... if I can produce her .
any idea where she &apos;s at ?
I thought you might be able to tell me .
right now , I wish I knew .
I &apos;ll tell you something , Reardon .
if there &apos;s one thing in this world I hate , it &apos;s a double-crossing dame .
that guy ... what &apos;s his name ?
never had a chance , did he ?
any one of the gang would have been sure to knock him off .
you might say Kitty Collins signed his death warrant .
Hello ? Yeah , speaking .
Yeah . Mmm-hmm .
Yeah , he &apos;s here with me right now .
okay .
a fellow named Jake the Rake .
- Asking about Kitty ? - Yeah .
I sent out word that she had till 10 : 00 tonight to get in touch with me ... or I &apos;d take what I know to the police .
so long , Colfax . glad to have met you .
say , Reardon. if ya do run on to her , let me know , will ya ?
after you &apos;re through with her ,
I &apos;d like to have a word or two with Kitty myself .
we got some unfinished business .
I wonder if that chambermaid can really identify Kitty .
after six years ? not a chance .
but Colfax fell for it . I think Kitty will too .
you know what I think ? I think we &apos;re nuts waitin &apos; here for that dame to call .
she &apos;ll call .
a deuce &apos;ll get you four she won &apos;t .
I haven &apos;t been on the force all these years for nothin &apos; .
I know more about women ...
Yes ? Reardon speaking .
wherever you say , Miss Collins .
the Green Cat on Sullivan Street ?
no . no , thanks .
I don &apos;t like the Green Cat .
better make it the lobby of the Adelphi theatre in 20 minutes .
no , I won &apos;t be there , but I &apos;ll send a man .
the show &apos;s already begun , so there won &apos;t be any crowd .
he &apos;ll bring you to me .
look , there &apos;ll be no police . I wanna make a deal .
if you &apos;re pinched , that ends that . figure it out for yourself .
good . the man &apos;ll be waiting .
blue suit , bow tie .
got a match ?
never mind .
I only wanted to see your tie .
I &apos;m ready .
we &apos;ll take a cab .
straight ahead .
I &apos;ll tell you when to turn .
- Where &apos;s Reardon ? - I &apos;m Reardon .
I should have known .
I was hoping you &apos;d call .
how &apos;d you know where to find me ?
a voice from the past , Jake the Rake , called me .
I took the first plane for Pittsburgh .
right at the next corner .
where are we going ?
the Green Cat on Sullivan Street .
thought you didn &apos;t like the Green Cat .
only when I &apos;m not expected .
glass of milk , hot .
I haven &apos;t eaten all day .
steak sandwich , rare , and a glass of beer .
very good , sir .
well , how about it ?
- How about what , Mr. Reardon ? - The $ 254,912 .
- You think I have it ? - For your sake , I hope so .
I &apos;m not the law .
my job is to recover money that the company I work for is out .
if the money &apos;s gone , well , putting you away for 20 years ... would be something to show for my time and effort .
can you put me away , Mr. Reardon ?
Blinky Franklin made a deathbed statement under oath .
there &apos;s no stronger testimony .
and there &apos;s a chambermaid in an Atlantic City hotel ... that has a memory for faces .
well ?
Oh , there &apos;s no use kidding myself . I &apos;d do anything you wanted .
give you every penny I could lay my hands on .
how many pennies is that ?
well , I ... I might be able to raise $ 65,000 , $ 70,000 at the most .
- Not enough . - That &apos;s all I could possibly get together .
I &apos;m not stalling , Mr. Reardon , not now .
I know when I &apos;m beaten .
I &apos;m fighting for my life . not Kitty Collins &apos; life , but mine .
I have a home now and a husband .
I &apos;ve got a life worth fighting for and there &apos;s nothing in this world ...
I wouldn &apos;t do to keep it just the way it is .
well , we might still be able to do business ... if you put a prize in with the CrackerJacks .
what do you mean ?
I want a fall guy for the law .
who would that be ?
Colfax .
even the old Kitty Collins never sang , Mr. Reardon .
well , I &apos;ll be moseying along .
do I tell the police where you live and what time you &apos;ll be home ?
Oh , please wait .
what is it you want ?
that &apos;s better .
who planned the robbery ?
- Colfax . - Was the Swede in love with you ?
I hadn &apos;t seen him for a long time , but the minute I laid eyes on him , I knew .
he was always looking at me , and it doesn &apos;t sound like very much , but he always carried a handkerchief I &apos;d given him .
green ... with golden harps ?
- Steak sandwich ? - For me .
the milk &apos;s for the lady .
Mr. Reardon , I &apos;d like you to believe something .
I hated my life , only I wasn &apos;t strong enough to get away from it .
all I could do was dream of some big payoff that would let me quit the whole racket .
the Swede was my chance to make my dream come true .
if I could only be alone with him for a few hours .
but Colfax was always there .
I thought it was hopeless , and then suddenly my chance came .
you mean the burning down of the Halfway House ?
Colfax sent me to tell the others what had happened , and that they were to meet at the farmer &apos;s instead .
I went to Blinky Franklin first and then to Dum-Dum .
I saved the Swede till last .
it was nearly two o &apos;clock in the morning when I got there .
Kitty !
what &apos;s up ?
I &apos;m taking my life in my hands coming to you like this .
but I just couldn &apos;t stand by , not after what you did for me that time in Philly .
forget that . why are you here now ?
Colfax thinks I &apos;m on my way to New York . he &apos;s meeting me there tomorrow .
but I just had to come to you , Swede , and tell you .
tell me what ?
they &apos;re planning to double-cross you .
who is ?
Colfax and the others .
they don &apos;t intend for you ever to get a smell of the money from tomorrow &apos;s job .
how do you know that ?
Colfax sprung it tonight on Dum-Dum and Blinky right after you left .
first he called you names and said dirty things about you , and then he sprung it .
what if they were not to go to the Halfway House after the robbery ?
you &apos;d go there , but they &apos;d be someplace else and so would the money .
- What did Blinky and Dum-Dum say ? - They fell right in with the idea .
- Where are they gonna meet ?
- The farmhouse north of town on Polk Road , eleven miles out on the turnpike .
Colfax hates you , Swede , so much so that Blinky and Dum-Dum have caught it from him , and they hate you too .
thanks for putting me wise , Kitty .
what are you gonna do ? Swede , what are you gonna do ?
I &apos;m gonna do them like they mean to do me .
promise me one thing .
you won &apos;t give me away .
- If Colfax ever found out what I did ... - Don &apos;t you worry .
you know why Colfax hates you ? because of me .
he &apos;s no fool .
he sees what &apos;s happened .
why did you ever go back to him , Kitty ?
maybe because I hate him .
I &apos;m poison , Swede , to myself and everybody around me .
I &apos;d be afraid to go with anyone I love for the harm I &apos;d do them .
I don &apos;t care , harming him .
you &apos;re not meeting &apos; him tomorrow .
aren &apos;t I , Swede ?
and that &apos;s it , Mr. Reardon . the whole story .
I knew then that by night the Swede &apos;d have the money , all of it .
and it all worked out .
he met me right after he left the farmer &apos;s place .
we drove down to Atlantic City .
and as soon as you could break away , you left him flat .
I &apos;d like to have known the old Kitty Collins .
you were in the clear because no one knew you &apos;d been with the Swede .
you had nothing to fear from anyone .
too bad it had to catch up with you now .
let &apos;s get out of here , Mr. Reardon .
I &apos;m nervous .
- Where do you want to go ? - It doesn &apos;t matter .
take me back to your hotel with you .
- I &apos;ll powder my nose . - I &apos;ll wait for you .
don &apos;t go away .
- How much further ? - About three miles .
cut your siren .
we &apos;ll drive right up and hit the front door .
you boys cover the other doors and windows .
right .
- Got your gun handy ? - Sure . why ?
just thought I &apos;d ask .
it &apos;s Dum-Dum .
cover us ! you get over there .
operator , this is a police call .
get an ambulance out to 792 River Bend . fast !
- Ambulance won &apos;t do any good . - Sorry , Colfax .
I &apos;d hoped to beat out Dum-Dum .
I wanted you alive .
- How &apos;d you figure it , Reardon ? - Dum-Dum tipped me .
he said Kitty brought him word at midnight about the changed meeting place .
the Halfway House didn &apos;t burn down till nearly three o &apos;clock in the morning .
that meant Kitty had a partner .
and who could he be but you ?
- Is this your woman ? - Yeah .
- Hello , Kitty . - We got her outside .
- How bad is he ? - The ambulance is on its way .
it &apos;s gonna be a little late .
I guess our luck &apos;s run out , Kitty .
you didn &apos;t have anything on her before now , did you ?
no , but I had to make you think so .
then I was sure you &apos;d try to knock me off before I could find out Kitty was your wife .
- You knew that too ? - A couple can &apos;t testify against each other .
otherwise , I &apos;d have tried playing you off , one against the other , instead of making myself a target for those gunmen of yours .
give me a cigarette , will you ?
what I don &apos;t get is why you sent those two killers to blast the Swede .
he wasn &apos;t doing you any harm there in Brentwood .
why didn &apos;t you let well enough alone ?
I couldn &apos;t .
suppose one of the gang ran into him , same as I did .
they were after the money .
he &apos;d have had a chance to tell his story and that would have been the end of it .
they knew Kitty and I were married , and they &apos;d have seen through the frame-up .
anyhow , if I hadn &apos;t had him knocked off , he &apos;d have wondered why ... and begun thinking .
Jim ! Jim !
tell them I didn &apos;t know anything . Jim , listen to me .
you can save me .
Jim , do you hear me ? tell them I didn &apos;t know those gunmen were coming .
say , &quot; Kitty is innocent . I swear , Kitty is innocent . &quot;
say it , Jim , say it ! it &apos;ll save me if you do .
don &apos;t ask a dying man to lie his soul into hell .
&quot; Kitty is innocent . I swear , Kitty is innocent . &quot;
it &apos;s no use , Kitty . your would-be fall guy is dead .
come back , Jim .
tell them . come back !
save me ! Jim !
&quot; Kitty is innocent . I swear , Kitty is innocent . &quot;
&quot; Kitty is innocent ! I swear , Kitty is innocent ! &quot;
&quot; Kitty is innocent ! &quot;
and the Swede never knew his girl ... had gone straight back to Colfax with all the money .
as for the others , they had no idea she &apos;d ever been away from Colfax .
- Have I got it all straight ? - Right .
then Colfax framed the whole thing just so he wouldn &apos;t have to split the take .
- The double cross to end all double crosses . - Yeah .
and just to think , none of this would have ever come to light ... if it hadn &apos;t been for a $ 2,500 death benefit .
Uh-huh .
well , I suppose you &apos;re waiting to be congratulated .
Ah , it &apos;s the job .
owing to your splendid efforts , the basic rate of the Atlantic Casualty Company as of 1947 ... will probably drop one-tenth of a cent .
congratulations , Mr. Reardon .
I &apos;d rather have a night &apos;s sleep .
why don &apos;t you take a good rest ? I must say , you &apos;ve earned it .
this is Friday . don &apos;t come in till Monday .
thanks .
no , Your Honor .
Yes . I have something to say .
you can put me away , but you can &apos;t put away what &apos;s going to happen to you and to this whole country next time .
next time , we are going to ... Don &apos;t say anymore . leave that for the appeal .
it is the judgment of this court that the defendant , John Huberman , having been found guilty of the crime of treason against the United States by the jury of this court for the southern district of Florida at Miami ,
be committed to the custody of the United States Attorney General for imprisonment in an institution of the penitentiary type for a period of 20 years .
and the defendant may be forthwith remanded to the custody of the United States Marshal .
the court is now adjourned .
here she comes .
just a minute , Miss Huberman .
we &apos;d like a statement from you , Miss Huberman , about your father .
for instance , do you think your father got what he deserved ?
could we say that you &apos;re pleased your father &apos;s going to pay the penalty for being a German worker ?
let us know if she tries to leave town .
would you care to pause for some refreshments , Mr. Hopkins ?
Alicia , were you really followed by a policeman ?
it sounds very exciting .
I &apos;m gonna shoot it out with them tomorrow . no , thanks .
had enough . so have you .
now , don &apos;t be silly . the important drinking hasn &apos;t started yet .
everybody down here has got a stuffed fish hanging on the wall .
where &apos;d they get it ?
never seen a fish .
how about you , handsome ? haven &apos;t I seen you somewhere before ?
well , it doesn &apos;t matter . I like party crashers .
he &apos;s not a party crasher . I brought him .
I wouldn &apos;t mind being followed by a cop .
I hate low , underhanded people like policemen , pussyfooting after you .
of course , I &apos;m a marked woman , you know .
I &apos;m liable to blow up the Panama Canal any minute now .
- You want some ice in it ?
- No , thank you .
it &apos;s not becoming for a lovely girl like you to be worried about policemen .
- You won &apos;t be tomorrow .
- Oh , really ?
- We sail at 10 : 00 .
- Really ? we just sail away ?
show me a fish and I &apos;ll show you a liar .
what this party needs is a little glam treatment .
we &apos;d better start breaking up , Alicia . we have to be on board at 9 : 00 .
one week in Havana and this whole thing about your father will have blown over .
do you love me , Commodore ?
- You &apos;re a very beautiful woman .
- I &apos;ll have another drink to appreciate that .
where are you going ? - Fishing .
- This time of night , you &apos;re mad .
- How about you ? still drinking ?
- What &apos;s the difference ?
there &apos;s no fish , day or night .
you know something ? I like you .
well , I &apos;ll see you on board , Alicia , at 9 : 00 .
I have to think that over .
you don &apos;t have to pack . we &apos;ll pick up some things in Havana .
I think I &apos;ll have to leave him here to dry out .
I &apos;m very sorry , you all have to go . it has been a perfectly hideous party .
good night .
good night .
there &apos;s one more drink left apiece .
shame about the ice .
- What is ?
- Gone .
- Who &apos;s gone ?
- The ice .
why do you like that song ?
because it &apos;s a lot of hooey .
there &apos;s nothing like a love song to give you a good laugh .
that &apos;s right .
it &apos;s stuffy in here , isn &apos;t it ?
might be .
what about
we have a picnic ?
outside ?
it &apos;s too stuffy in here for a picnic .
- Want to finish that ?
- Shame to leave it .
you &apos;re quite a boy .
- My car is outside . - Naturally .
- Want to go for a ride ? - Very much .
what about your guests ?
they &apos;ll crawl out under their own steam .
I &apos;m gonna drive . that &apos;s understood .
don &apos;t you need a coat ?
you &apos;ll do .
wait a minute .
let me put this on you , or you might catch cold .
- How am I doing ? - Not bad .
- Scared ? - No .
- No , you &apos;re not scared of anything .
- Not too much .
- This fog gets me . - It &apos;s your hair in your eyes .
what does the speedometer say ?
Sixty-five .
I want to make it 80 , and wipe that grin off your face .
I don &apos;t like gentlemen who grin at me .
- A cop .
- What ?
a policeman is chasing us . look .
they make me sick .
he wants to talk to you .
drunken driving .
my second offense . now I go to jail .
the whole family in jail . who cares ?
having a time for yourself , aren &apos;t you ?
people like you ought to be in bed .
- Drunk , huh ?
- Just a minute , Officer .
no arguments , mister . you ain &apos;t got a leg to stand on .
- Sorry , but you didn &apos;t speak up .
that &apos;s all right .
sure you can handle it ?
no trouble .
you ought to know .
where is the ticket ?
he didn &apos;t give me a ticket .
- What &apos;s your name ?
- Devlin .
you showed that cop something . he saluted you .
- Did he ?
- I saw him .
why , you double-crossing buzzard . you &apos;re a cop !
- All right , we &apos;ll argue later .
- Get away from my car . get out of my car .
- I &apos;m gonna take you home .
- You &apos;re not going to take me home at all !
move over .
come on .
get out of my car , federal cop . you &apos;re crashing my party .
just like that buzzard with the glasses .
leave me alone ! you &apos;re trailing me to get something on me .
are you going to calm down ?
good . now move over .
I &apos;m not gonna ...
you &apos;d better drink that .
why all this service ?
go on , drink it .
finish it .
feel better ?
what do you care how I feel ?
you ... You cop .
what &apos;s this all about ?
- What &apos;s your angle ?
- What angle ?
- About last night .
- Just wanted to be friends . friends .
Yeah . - So you could frame me ?
- No . I &apos;ve got a job for you .
don &apos;t tell me . there &apos;s only ...
there &apos;s only one job that you coppers would want me for .
- Well , you can forget it , Mr ...
- Devlin .
- What ?
- Devlin .
I &apos;m no stool pigeon , Mr. Devlin .
my department authorized me to engage you to do some work for us . it &apos;s a job in Brazil .
go away . the whole thing bores me .
some of the German gentry who were paying your father are working in Rio .
- Ever hear of the I.G. Farben industries ?
- I tell you , I &apos;m not interested .
Farben has men in South America planted there before the war .
we &apos;re cooperating with the Brazilian government to smoke them out .
- My chief thinks that the daughter of a ...
- Of a traitor ?
he thinks you might be valuable in the work .
they might sort of trust you .
you could make up a little for your daddy &apos;s peculiarities .
- Why should I ?
- Patriotism .
that word gives me pain . no , thank you .
I don &apos;t go for patriotism , or patriots .
I &apos;d like to dispute that with you .
waving the flag with one hand and picking pockets with the other .
that &apos;s your patriotism .
well , you can have it .
we &apos;ve had your bungalow wired for three months .
&quot; conversation between John Huberman and daughter Alicia ,
&quot; 6 : 30 p.m. , January 9 , 1946 , at Miami Beach , Florida . &quot;
some of the evidence that wasn &apos;t used at the trial .
I don &apos;t want to hear that .
relax , hard-boiled , and listen .
there is for both of us , a mint of money in it , Alicia .
I told you before Christmas I wouldn &apos;t do it .
you don &apos;t use your judgment . you can have anything you want .
- The work is easy .
- I &apos;m not listening , Father .
this is not your country , is it ?
my mother was born here . we have American citizenship .
where is your judgment ? in your feelings you are German .
you got to listen to me . you don &apos;t know what we stand for .
I know what you stand for , you and your murderous wife .
I &apos;ve hated you ever since I found out .
- My daughter , don &apos;t talk to me like that .
- Stay on your side of the table !
Alicia , put your voice down .
I hate you all , and I love this country .
do you understand that ? I love it .
I &apos;ll see you all hang before I raise a finger against it .
now go on and get out of here , or , so help me , I &apos;ll turn you in .
don &apos;t ever come near me or speak to me again about your rotten schemes .
well , that doesn &apos;t prove much . - I didn &apos;t turn him in .
- We didn &apos;t expect you to .
well , what do you say ?
go away and leave me alone .
I have my own life to lead .
good times , that &apos;s what I want , and laughs with people I like .
and no underhanded cops who want to put me up in a shooting gallery .
but people of my own kind , who treat me right , and like me and understand me .
good morning , Alicia .
Hello .
thought you might need a hand this morning . we &apos;re sailing with the tide , you know .
- Are you ready ? - Yes .
- Don &apos;t tell me you &apos;ve forgotten , my dear ?
- Almost . I &apos;ll help you pack .
although you don &apos;t need anything . we got everything on board .
thank you .
I &apos;ll pack myself .
we &apos;re moored at the hotel pier . you know the spot . - Yes .
- You &apos;re a darling .
sweetest girl I ever knew .
see you soon .
well , what about it ? plane leaves tomorrow morning , early .
all right . you better tell him .
I &apos;ll tell her . see you later .
that &apos;s a very nice-Iooking man .
you &apos;ll be seeing him in Rio .
no , I won &apos;t be seeing any men in Rio . Yes , you will .
that &apos;s our boss , Paul Prescott .
- Did he say anything about the job ? - No .
no hints ?
no .
he had some news about your father he picked up at the last stop .
- What about him ?
- He died this morning .
Oh .
- Poison capsule .
- He did it himself ?
- Yes , in his cell .
sorry .
I don &apos;t know why I should feel so bad .
when he told me a few years ago what he was , everything went to pot .
I didn &apos;t care what happened to me .
now I remember how nice he once was , how nice we both were . very nice .
it &apos;s a very curious feeling .
as if something had happened to me , and not to him .
you see , I don &apos;t have to hate him anymore .
or myself .
we &apos;re coming into Rio .
Yes . so we are .
I wonder if the Embassy or someone can get me a maid .
it &apos;s a nice apartment , and I don &apos;t mind dusting and sweeping , but I hate cooking .
I &apos;ll ask them .
while you &apos;re at it , find out when I go to work ,
- and on what . - Yes , ma &apos;am .
- Have another drink ?
no , thank you . I &apos;ve had enough .
whiskey and soda , please .
well , did you hear that ?
I &apos;m practically on the wagon .
it &apos;s a phase .
you don &apos;t think a woman can change ? sure .
and change is fun . for a while .
for a while .
what a rat you are , Devlin .
all right . you &apos;ve been sober for eight days .
as far as I know , you &apos;ve made no new conquests .
well , that &apos;s something .
eight days . practically whitewashed .
I &apos;m very happy , Dev .
- Why won &apos;t you let me be happy ?
- Nobody &apos;s stopping you .
why don &apos;t you give that copper &apos;s brain of yours a rest ?
every time you look at me , I can see it running over its slogans ,
&quot; once a crook , always a crook . once a tramp , always a tramp . &quot;
go on . you can hold my hand . I won &apos;t blackmail you for it afterwards .
scared ?
I &apos;ve always been scared of women , but I get over it .
and now you &apos;re scared of yourself .
- You &apos;re afraid you &apos;ll fall in love with me .
- That wouldn &apos;t be hard .
now careful , careful .
you enjoy making fun of me , don &apos;t you ?
no , Dev . I &apos;m making fun of myself .
I &apos;m pretending I &apos;m a nice , unspoiled child , whose heart is full of daisies and buttercups .
nice daydream . then what ?
- I think I will have another drink .
- I thought you &apos;d get around to it .
make it a double .
why won &apos;t you believe in me , Dev ?
just a little .
why won &apos;t you ?
I know why you won &apos;t , Dev . you &apos;re sore because you &apos;ve fallen for the little drunk you tailed in Miami , and you don &apos;t like it .
it makes you sick all over , doesn &apos;t it ?
people will laugh at you . the invincible Devlin , in love with someone who isn &apos;t worth even wasting the words on .
poor Dev .
in love with a no-good gal . it must be awful . I &apos;m sorry ...
gentlemen , I assure you she &apos;s the perfect type for the job .
it &apos;s not the girl . it &apos;s these German scientists I &apos;m worried about .
I simply question why we don &apos;t find some way of taking them into custody .
it &apos;d do no good .
even if you arrest their leader , Alexander Sebastian , tomorrow another Farben man takes his place , their work goes on .
Yes , you &apos;re right .
I see , Captain Prescott , your method is the best way .
well , she &apos;s good at making friends with gentlemen , and we want somebody inside his house , in his confidence .
you have faith in this procedure , Captain Prescott ? Yes .
with somebody on the inside ...
- Have you consulted the young lady ? - No , not yet .
as a matter of fact , our man , Devlin , just brought her down here the other day .
now we &apos;re waiting for Sebastian to come back to Rio .
has your Mr. Devlin told her the nature of the work ? no .
we haven &apos;t discussed it with him at all , but I can set your mind at rest about her .
- You &apos;re sure of her political side ? Oh , yes .
well , there is nothing to be lost if we proceed as you advise . now that &apos;s fine .
I &apos;ll give Devlin his instructions right away .
it &apos;s nice out here .
let &apos;s not go out for dinner . let &apos;s stay here .
we have to eat .
we can eat here . I &apos;ll cook .
- I thought you didn &apos;t like to cook .
- No , I don &apos;t like to cook .
but I have a chicken in the icebox , and you &apos;re eating it .
what about all the washing up afterwards ?
we &apos;ll eat it with our fingers .
- Don &apos;t we need any plates ?
- Yes . one for you and one for me .
would you mind if I had dinner with you tonight ?
I &apos;d be delighted .
where are you going ?
if we &apos;re gonna stay in , I have to telephone the hotel , see if there are any messages .
- Do you have to ? - I have to .
- This is a very strange love affair . - Why ?
maybe the fact that you don &apos;t love me .
Hello , Palace Hotel ?
this is T.R. Devlin . are there any messages for me ?
when I don &apos;t love you , I &apos;ll let you know .
- You haven &apos;t said anything .
- Actions speak louder than words .
good . read it to me , please .
Prescott wants me over right away .
- Did he say what about ?
- No .
- Maybe it &apos;s our assignment . - Probably .
want me to bring anything back with me ?
Yes . what about a nice bottle of wine to celebrate ?
- What time should I come back ?
- 7 : 00 .
- Goodbye . - Goodbye .
what is it , Devlin ? what &apos;s the matter ? I don &apos;t know if she &apos;ll do it .
what do you mean you don &apos;t think she ...
you haven &apos;t discussed it with her , have you ?
no . I didn &apos;t know what the job was until this moment .
what do you mean she wouldn &apos;t do it ? well , I don &apos;t think she &apos;s that type of woman .
she strikes me to be ...
I don &apos;t understand your attitude .
- Why do you think she won &apos;t do it ? - Well , she &apos;s had no experience .
come now .
what experience does she lack , do you think ?
she &apos;s never been trained for that kind of work . they &apos;ll see through her .
this woman was chosen not only because her father gives her an ideal background , but because Sebastian knows her .
Yes .
he was once in love with her .
I didn &apos;t know that .
I don &apos;t see why we &apos;re arguing about petty things like this ?
we &apos;ve got important work to do .
Sebastian &apos;s house is a cover-up for whatever this Farben Group is up to here in Rio .
we &apos;ve got to get Miss Huberman inside that house and find out what &apos;s going on there .
Yes , that &apos;s right .
so I think you &apos;d better go back to Miss Huberman and explain to her what she has to do .
I ...
what is it ?
- Nothing , sir .
I thought you were gonna say something .
how is the meeting to be arranged ?
we discussed that . I think the Riding Club would be the best place .
Sebastian usually rides there in the mornings .
so the rest is up to you and Miss Huberman .
- Okay , Devlin , that &apos;s all .
- All right .
Dev , is that you ?
- Uh-huh .
I &apos;m glad you &apos;re late .
this chicken took longer than I expected .
what did they say ?
hope it isn &apos;t done too much . it caught fire once .
I think it &apos;s better if I cut it up out here , unless you want a half of one to yourself .
we &apos;re going to have knives and forks after all .
I &apos;ve decided we &apos;re going to eat in style .
marriage must be wonderful , with this sort of thing going on every day .
I wonder if it &apos;s too cold out here .
maybe we should eat inside .
hasn &apos;t something like this happened before ?
what &apos;s the matter ?
don &apos;t look so tense . troubles ?
well , handsome , I think you better tell mama what &apos;s going on , or all this secrecy is going to ruin my little dinner .
come on , Mr. D , what is darkening your brow ?
- After dinner .
- No , now .
look , I &apos;ll make it easy for you .
the time has come when you must tell me that you have a wife and two adorable children , and this madness between us can &apos;t go on any longer .
I bet you &apos;ve heard that line often enough .
right below the belt every time .
- That isn &apos;t fair , Dev .
- Skip it .
we have other things to talk about .
so there is a job .
you remember a man named Sebastian ?
- Alex Sebastian ? - Yes .
one of my father &apos;s friends , yes .
- He had quite a crush on you .
- I wasn &apos;t very responsive .
he &apos;s here . the head of a large German business concern .
his family always had money .
he &apos;s part of the combine that built the German war machine ,
- and hopes to keep on going . - Something big ?
it has all the earmarks of being something big .
we have to contact him .
go on . let &apos;s have all of it .
we &apos;re meeting him tomorrow . the rest is up to you .
you &apos;ve got to work on him and land him .
Mata Hari . she makes love for the papers .
there are no papers .
you land him .
find out what &apos;s going on inside his house , what the group around him is up to , and report to us .
I suppose you knew about this pretty little job of mine all the time .
no , I only just found out about it .
did you say anything ?
I mean , that maybe I wasn &apos;t the girl for such shenanigans .
I figured that was up to you , if you &apos;d care to back out .
I suppose you told them Alicia Huberman will have this Sebastian eating out of her hand in a couple of weeks .
- She &apos;s good at that .
always was . - I didn &apos;t say anything .
not a word for that little lovesick lady you left an hour ago ?
- I told you , that &apos;s the assignment .
- Well , now , don &apos;t get sore , Dev .
I &apos;m only fishing for a little birdcall from my dream man .
one little remark such as ,
&quot; how dare you gentlemen suggest that Alicia Huberman ,
&quot; the new Miss Huberman , be submitted to so ugly a fate ? &quot;
that &apos;s not funny .
do you want me to take the job ?
- You &apos;re answering for yourself .
- I am asking you .
it &apos;s up to you .
not a peep ?
darling , what you didn &apos;t tell them , tell me .
that you believe I &apos;m nice , and that I love you , and I &apos;ll never change back .
I &apos;m waiting for your answer .
what a little pal you are .
never believing me .
not a word of faith .
just down the drain with Alicia . that &apos;s where she belongs .
Oh , Dev . Dev ...
- When do I go to work for Uncle Sam ?
- Tomorrow morning .
we shouldn &apos;t have had this out here . it &apos;s all cold now .
what are you looking for ?
I had a bottle of champagne . I must have left it somewhere .
in case you &apos;re asked , I &apos;m with Pan American Airways .
- As Devlin ? - Yes .
public relations office .
anything else ?
except , we met on the plane coming in from Miami .
the less detail the better .
- Are you sure that &apos;s him ? - Yes .
we &apos;ll go by him easy .
let him spot you . come on .
I guess I &apos;m the girl nobody remembers .
- Was it Sebastian ?
- Yes .
we &apos;ll stick around , give him another chance .
my dear Alicia . will you forgive me for being late ?
last-minute conference at the office . you got my message ?
Yes . it &apos;s all right , Alex .
sweet of you to wait .
- I was afraid you might run off .
- I &apos;m not that easily put off .
I was too anxious to meet you again .
you know , I &apos;m tired .
the worst thing about business is it makes you feel old and look old .
you seem to have escaped all of that .
four years of dullness and disintegration .
awful .
Alex , you look younger than you did in Washington .
it &apos;s a temporary improvement entirely due to your presence , my dear .
you always affected me like a tonic .
perhaps now , with you here in Rio , unless you insist on running away from me again .
- Would you like another drink ?
- Yes , thank you .
you know him ?
no , I don &apos;t think so , but he seems familiar .
Captain Prescott . intelligence man .
he &apos;s down here as part of the Washington espionage .
the American Embassy &apos;s loaded with them .
really ?
he &apos;s rather handsome , isn &apos;t he ?
I &apos;m allergic to American agents .
their fine points don &apos;t particularly appeal to me .
they &apos;ve bothered you since you came down ?
no , not yet .
they were troublesome in Miami ?
Yes , that &apos;s why I left right after the trial , to get away from their snooping .
I wondered why you left your father .
he insisted . he was so unselfish .
he kept worrying about me , begging me to leave .
I had no idea he was going to die .
many things have died for all of us . we mustn &apos;t let our spirit die with them .
perhaps I can help you to forget .
it &apos;s odd , but I feel at home with you .
you know , my dear , I knew this was going to happen .
I knew , when we met the other day that if I saw you again , I &apos;d feel what I used to for you .
the same hunger .
you &apos;re so lovely , my dear .
now I &apos;m going to make a fool of myself again .
there &apos;s someone else , of course .
that Mr. Devlin you were with ?
there is no one .
he seemed attentive .
Mr. Devlin has pestered me with his attentiveness ever since I arrived .
I met him on a plane from Miami .
you made a pretty couple . Oh , no , Alex .
Mr. Devlin doesn &apos;t interest me .
I was so lonely that day , I could have gone riding with Peter Rabbit .
you &apos;ll let me help your loneliness ?
you &apos;re very sweet to forget what a brat I was once .
my dear , I shall test out your repentance at once .
will you have dinner with me again tomorrow night ?
- Thank you very much .
- My house ?
how nice .
my mother &apos;s giving a dinner party .
she won &apos;t mind an extra guest ?
an old friend is never an extra guest .
- Well , should we order now ?
- Yes , I &apos;m starved .
now , let &apos;s see . what shall we have for our first dinner together ?
good evening .
very good .
Yes . Yes , isn &apos;t it ?
I &apos;d like you to wear these . they &apos;re rented for the occasion .
- Would you help me , please ?
- Why , yes . certainly .
- Thank you .
- So the old boy knew me ?
Yes , he thought you were very handsome .
you don &apos;t say ! sorry I &apos;m not going with you .
- Dev will pick those up later . - All right .
try to memorize the names of all the people you see there tonight .
the men , I mean .
and get their nationalities . that &apos;s very important .
you mean the Germans ? that won &apos;t be difficult for me .
and I suggest that you don &apos;t ask any questions . just use your eyes and ears .
they &apos;re a pretty keen and desperate bunch . don &apos;t underestimate them .
thank you for your instructions . good evening .
by the way , unless you have something very urgent to report ,
I suggest you two keep shy of each other for the next few days , that &apos;s in case Sebastian &apos;s people want to check on you after your visit .
good evening .
- That &apos;s all . good luck .
good night .
good evening . I &apos;m Miss Huberman . will you tell Mr. Sebastian that I &apos;m here ?
- Miss Huberman ? - Yes .
please forgive me for keeping you waiting .
not at all .
you resemble your father very much . I &apos;m Alex &apos;s mother .
I knew when I saw you .
Alex has always admired you . now , at last , I know why .
you &apos;re very kind .
you did not testify at your father &apos;s trial . we thought that unusual .
he didn &apos;t want me to .
he refused to let his lawyers call me on the stand .
I wonder why .
Hello . Alicia .
I &apos;m so glad .
- You met my mother ?
- Yes , we just met .
you didn &apos;t meet Alicia when we were in Washington four years ago , did you , Mother ? I don &apos;t know where you were at the time .
Alex , I think we should join our other guests .
- May I take your wrap ?
- Thank you .
Miss Huberman , may I present Eric Mathis .
- How do you do ?
how do you do ?
William Rossner .
how do you do ?
very honored .
Emil Hupka .
how do you do ?
delighted . and Mr. Knerr .
and Dr. Anderson .
Dr. Anderson .
it gives me great pleasure .
Dr. Anderson &apos;s our guest of honor tonight .
you mustn &apos;t bore Miss Huberman , Alex , with discourses on science .
not before dinner , anyway .
dinner is served , madame .
Dr. Anderson , you will sit beside me over there .
Eric , you will sit next to Miss Huberman .
you have just come from Spain , señora ?
a few weeks ago . it seems ages .
travel does not mean anything anymore . it goes so swiftly . one has the feeling ...
that bottle doesn &apos;t belong here . Shh . you &apos;re mistaken .
we can expect rocket ships to be carrying us around the ocean very soon .
we can expect many strange things .
see a good movie this afternoon , Eric ? no , I was disappointed .
must have been a comedy .
you know , Eric loves to go to the movies to cry .
he &apos;s very sentimental .
I &apos;m afraid , gentlemen , that something must be done about Emil .
I don &apos;t know .
it was an understandable slip . the man was tired .
no . but it was a very dangerous slip .
it &apos;s not the first one . there have been several other lapses before .
there will be more if you permit him .
that &apos;s bad . that &apos;s very bad .
I think , gentlemen , you can leave it to me to find some way .
when you drive up to Petrópolis , the road winds quite a bit .
it is very high . there are some very awkward turns .
I &apos;m sure I will not have any difficulty in getting Emil to give me a lift in his car .
it &apos;s quite a trick to jump clear .
I &apos;ll just have to be careful , that is all .
turned my ankle the last time .
Madame says will you join the others , or will you take your coffee in here ?
I think we &apos;ll take coffee in here , Emil .
I &apos;m very sorry , gentlemen , to make such an exhibition .
nonsense .
we all have nerves .
you have been overworking .
don &apos;t you think , Sebastian ?
you need to rest .
- Your health is very important to us .
- That &apos;s very considerate .
I am very tired , so now , I think , perhaps if you &apos;ll make my pardon to the ladies ,
Alex , for my leaving so early , then I ...
maybe , Emil , it would be better if I came with you .
perhaps if you tried to drive yourself all the way up to Petrópolis , it might be too much for you .
I shall drive you .
no .
that would be too much for you . all that way , it is too much to ask . nonsense .
I &apos;d love to go .
come on , Emil .
good night , gentlemen
